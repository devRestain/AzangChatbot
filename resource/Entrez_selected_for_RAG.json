			"abstract": "Probiotics have been described to influence host health and prevent the risk of obesity by gut microbiome (GM) modulation. In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled feasibility study, we investigated whether Vivomixx(R) multi-strain probiotics administered to 50 women with obesity during pregnancy altered the GM composition and perinatal health outcomes of their infants up to 9 months after birth. The mothers and infants were followed up with four visits after birth: at 3 d, and at 3, 6, and 9 months after delivery. The infants were monitored by anthropometric measurements, fecal sample analysis, and questionnaires regarding health and diet.The study setup after birth was feasible, and the women and infants were willing to participate in additional study visits and collection of fecal samples during the 9-month follow-up. In total, 47 newborns were included for microbiome analysis.Maternal prenatal Vivomixx(R) administration did not alter infant GM diversity nor differential abundance, and the probiotic strains were not vertically transferred. However, the infant GM exhibited a decreased prevalence of the obesity-associated genera, Collinsella, in the probiotic group and of the metabolic health-associated Akkermansia in the placebo group, indicating that indirect community-scale effects of Vivomixx(R) on the GM of the mothers could be transferred to the infant.Moreover, 3 d after birth, the GM of the infant was influenced by mode of delivery and antibiotics administered during birth. Vaginally delivered infants had increased diversity and relative abundance of the metabolic health-associated Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides while having a decreased relative abundance of Enterococcus compared with infants delivered by cesarean section. Maternal antibiotic administration during birth resulted in a decreased relative abundance of Bifidobacteriumin the GM of the infants. In conclusion, this study observed potential effects on obesity-associated infant GM after maternal probiotic supplementation.",

			"abstract": "The human gut microbiome establishes and matures during infancy, and dysregulation at this stage may lead to pathologies later in life. We conducted a multi-omics study comprising three generations of family members to investigate the early development of the gut microbiota. Fecal samples from 200 individuals, including infants (0-12 months old; 55% females, 45% males) and their respective mothers and grandmothers, were analyzed using two independent metabolomics platforms and metagenomics. For metabolomics, gas chromatography and capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry were applied. For metagenomics, both 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing were performed. Here we show that infants greatly vary from their elders in fecal microbiota populations, function, and metabolome. Infants have a less diverse microbiota than adults and present differences in several metabolite classes, such as short- and branched-chain fatty acids, which are associated with shifts in bacterial populations. These findings provide innovative biochemical insights into the shaping of the gut microbiome within the same generational line that could be beneficial in improving childhood health outcomes.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the diagnostic potential of serum intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), fecal calprotectin (FC), and fecal human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) in predicting necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. METHODS: A prospective cohort of neonates with a gestational age < 32 weeks, suspected of NEC, was enrolled between June 2021 and December 2022. Serum I-FABP, FC, and fecal hBD2 levels were measured upon NEC suspicion, and diagnosis was confirmed through radiological examination or surgical intervention. Diagnostic precision of serum I-FABP, FC, and fecal hBD2 was assessed using a logistic regression model with multiple variables. RESULTS: The study included 70 neonates (45 males, 25 females), with 30 developing NEC (40% Stage III, n = 12; 60% Stage II, n = 18) and 40 in the control group. NEC patients exhibited significantly higher serum I-FABP and FC levels (4.76 ng/mL and 521.56 microg/g feces, respectively) than those with other diagnoses (1.38 ng/mL and 213.34 microg/g feces, respectively; p < 0.05 for both biomarkers). Stage II NEC neonates showed elevated fecal hBD2 levels (376.44 ng/g feces) than Stage III NEC neonates and controls (336.87 ng/g and 339.86 ng/g feces, respectively; p < 0.05). No such increase was observed in infants progressing to Stage III NEC. Using a serum I-FABP threshold of > 2.54 ng/mL yielded 76.7% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, 82.1% positive predictive value (PPV), and 83.3% negative predictive value (NPV). For FC (cutoff > 428.99 microg/g feces), corresponding values were 76.7% sensitivity, 67.5% specificity, 63.9% PPV, and 79.4% NPV. CONCLUSION: Serum I-FABP and FC levels are valuable for early NEC detection and provide insights into disease severity. Low fecal hBD2 levels suggest an inadequate response to luminal bacteria, potentially rendering these infants more susceptible to NEC development or exacerbation.",

			"article_name": "First Insight into Fetal Exposure to Legacy and Emerging Plasticizers Revealed by Infant Hair and Meconium: Occurrence, Biotransformation, and Accumulation.",
			"abstract": "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the embryonic and developmental toxicity of plasticizers. Thus, understanding the in utero biotransformation and accumulation of plasticizers is essential to assessing their fate and potential toxicity in early life. In the present study, 311 infant hair samples and 271 paired meconium samples were collected at birth in Guangzhou, China, to characterize fetal exposure to legacy and emerging plasticizers and their metabolites. Results showed that most of the target plasticizers were detected in infant hair, with medians of 9.30, 27.6, and 0.145 ng/g for phthalate esters (PAEs), organic phosphate ester (OPEs), and alternative plasticizers (APs), and 1.44, 0.313, and 0.066 ng/g for the metabolites of PAEs, OPEs, and APs, respectively. Positive correlations between plasticizers and their corresponding primary metabolites, as well as correlations among the oxidative metabolites of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH), were observed, indicating that infant hair retained the major phase-I metabolism of the target plasticizers. While no positive correlations were found in parent compounds or their primary metabolites between paired infant hair and meconium, significant positive correlations were observed among secondary oxidative metabolites of DEHP and DINCH in hair and meconium, suggesting that the primary metabolites in meconium come from hydrolysis of plasticizers in the fetus but most of the oxidative metabolites come from maternal-fetal transmission. The parent compound/metabolite ratios in infant hair showed a decreasing trend across pregnancy, suggesting in utero accumulation and deposition of plasticizers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report in utero exposure to both parent compounds and metabolites of plasticizers by using paired infant hair and meconium as noninvasive biomonitoring matrices and provides novel insights into the fetal biotransformation and accumulation of plasticizers across pregnancy.",

			"article_name": "The impact of iron supplementation on the preterm neonatal gut microbiome: A pilot study.",
			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The gastrointestinal microbiome in preterm infants exhibits significant influence on optimal outcomes-with dysbiosis shown to substantially increase the risk of the life-threatening necrotizing enterocolitis. Iron is a vital nutrient especially during the perinatal window of rapid hemoglobin production, tissue growth, and foundational neurodevelopment. However, excess colonic iron exhibits potent oxidation capacity and alters the gut microbiome-potentially facilitating the proliferation of pathological bacterial strains. Breastfed preterm infants routinely receive iron supplementation starting 14 days after delivery and are highly vulnerable to morbidities associated with gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, we set out to determine if routine iron supplementation alters the preterm gut microbiome. METHODS: After IRB approval, we collected stool specimens from 14 infants born <34 weeks gestation in the first, second, and fourth week of life to assess gut microbiome composition via 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in either phyla or key genera relative abundance between pre- and post-iron timepoints. We observed notable shifts in infant microbiome composition based on season of delivery. CONCLUSION: Though no obvious indication of iron-induced dysbiosis was observed in this unique study in the setting of prematurity, further investigation in a larger sample is warranted to fully understand iron's impact on the gastrointestinal milieu.",

			"article_name": "Temporal colonization and metabolic regulation of the gut microbiome in neonatal oxen at single nucleotide resolution.",
			"abstract": "The colonization of microbes in the gut is key to establishing a healthy host-microbiome symbiosis for newborns. We longitudinally profiled the gut microbiome in a model consisting of 36 neonatal oxen from birth up to 2 months postpartum and carried out microbial transplantation to reshape their gut microbiome. Genomic reconstruction of deeply sequenced fecal samples resulted in a total of 3931 metagenomic-assembled genomes from 472 representative species, of which 184 were identified as new species when compared with existing databases of oxen. Single nucleotide level metagenomic profiling shows a rapid influx of microbes after birth, followed by dynamic shifts during the first few weeks of life. Microbial transplantation was found to reshape the genetic makeup of 33 metagenomic-assembled genomes (FDR < 0.05), mainly from Prevotella and Bacteroides species. We further linked over 20 million microbial single nucleotide variations to 736 plasma metabolites, which enabled us to characterize 24 study-wide significant associations (P < 4.4 x 10-9) that identify the potential microbial genetic regulation of host immune and neuro-related metabolites, including glutathione and L-dopa. Our integration analyses further revealed that microbial genetic variations may influence the health status and growth performance by modulating metabolites via structural regulation of their encoded proteins. For instance, we found that the albumin levels and total antioxidant capacity were correlated with L-dopa, which was determined by single nucleotide variations via structural regulations of metabolic enzymes. The current results indicate that temporal colonization and transplantation-driven strain replacement are crucial for newborn gut development, offering insights for enhancing newborn health and growth.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid is one of the causes for birth asphyxia. Each year, over five million neonatal deaths occur worldwide because of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and other causes, of which 90% are due to birth asphyxia. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and associated factors among women who gave birth in North Shoa Zone Hospitals, Amhara Region, Ethiopia, 2022. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was employed. We used 610 women who gave birth at North Shoa Zone Hospitals, Amhara region, Ethiopia. The study was conducted from June 8 to August 8, 2022. Recruitment for the study was made using a multistage sampling procedure. Fifty percent of the study hospitals were randomly selected, and proportional allocation was done. Participants were selected from the sampling frame, labour and delivery register book, using a systematic random sampling approach. The first person was selected at random, while the remaining individuals were selected at every two \"K\" intervals across all hospitals. An interview-administered structured questionnaire and chart review checklist were used to gather the data that were entered into Epi-Data Version 4.6 and exported to SPSS. Logistics regression was employed, and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT: The magnitude of meconium-stained amniotic fluid was 30.3%. Women with a normal hematocrit level were 83% less likely to develop meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Women whose mid-upper arm circumference value was less than 22.9cm (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.18-3.20), obstructed labour (AOR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.48-8.83), prolonged labour >/= 15 hr (AOR = 7.5; 95% CI: 7.68-13.3), premature rapture of membrane (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 3.22-7.40), foetal tachycardia (AOR = 6.2; 95% CI: 2.41-16.3), and Bradycardia (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.93-5.28) showed a significant association with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the magnitude of meconium-stained amniotic fluid in North Shoa Zone is nearly one-third. A normal hematocrit level is a preventive factor for meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and a MUAC value <22.9 cm, obstructed and prolonged labour, PROM, bradycardia, and tachycardia are factors associated with meconium-stained amniotic fluid.",

			"article_name": "A common trajectory of gut microbiome development during the first month in healthy neonates with limited inter-individual environmental variations.",
			"abstract": "The early development of the gut microbiome is governed by multiple factors and has significantly long-term effects on later-in-life health. To minimize inter-individual variations in the environment, we determined developmental trajectories of the gut microbiome in 28 healthy neonates during their stay at a postpartum center. Stool samples were collected at three time points: the first-pass meconium within 24 h of life, and at 7 and 28 days of age. Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA was used to investigate microbiota profiles. We found that there was a distinct microbiota structure at each time point, with a significant shift during the first week. Proteobacteria was most abundant in the first-pass meconium; Firmicutes and Actinobacteria increased with age and were substituted as the major components. Except for a short-term influence of different delivery modes on the microbiota composition, early microbiome development was not remarkably affected by gravidity, maternal intrapartum antibiotic treatment, premature rupture of membranes, or postnatal phototherapy. Hence, our data showed a similar developmental trajectory of the gut microbiome during the first month in healthy neonates when limited in environmental variations. Environmental factors external to the host were crucial in the early microbiome development.",

			"article_name": "Isolation, identification, and in vitro probiotic characterization of forty novel Bifidobacterium strains from neonatal feces in Erzurum province, Turkiye.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal feces are one of the most important sources for probiotic isolation. The purpose of this study was the isolation and identification of Bifidobacterium spp. from neonatal feces and the evaluation of in vitro probiotic properties of strains including safety tests. RESULTS: A total of 40 isolates were obtained from 14 healthy newborns' feces in Erzurum province, Turkiye. By their rep-PCR patterns and 16S rRNA gene sequences, isolates were identified as 26 Bifidobacterium breve and 14 Bifidobacterium longum. Fifteen of the isolates tolerated bile salts and showed high resistance to simulated gastric juice. Isolates exhibited varying rates of auto-aggregation and hydrophobicity. In addition, most of the isolates displayed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Salmonella Typhimurium RSHMB 95091, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. However, only one strain showed bile salt hydrolase activity and two strains showed the ability to produce H(2)O(2). Bifidobacterium strains were generally sensitive to the tested antibiotics and lacked kanamycin, gentamicin, and streptomycin resistance genes, and hemolytic and DNAse activities. On the other hand, it was determined that five strains had various virulence genes including gelE, esp, efaAfs, hyl, and ace. CONCLUSION: Results of the present study suggested that B. longum BH28, B. breve BH4 and B. breve BH5 strains have the potential as probiotic candidates for further studies. (c) 2024 The Authors.

			"article_name": "A 14-year review (2007-2020) of helminthiasis epidemiology in a hospital in Southern Madrid, Spain.",
			"abstract": "PURPOSE: Vast majority of helminth diseases remain neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), causing significant morbidity. The widespread and periodic distribution of antiparasitic drugs, remains the cornerstone for controlling these diseases. In Spain, most helminthiasis cases are imported, and suspicion and diagnosis have become increasingly important. Our primary objective is to present the epidemiological landscape of helminthiasis diagnoses within our facility, while also detailing the demographic characteristics of the affected population. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at the Hospital Universitario Severo Ochoa (HUSO) from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2020, encompassing all diagnosed cases of helminthiasis during this period. Comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological data were gathered for all diagnosed patients. The study population comprised patients receiving treatment at the HUSO, as well as those receiving treatment at the Leganes and Fuenlabrada Primary Care Units. Subsequently, descriptive and comparative statistics were performed, comparing Spanish and foreign patients. RESULTS: During this period, a total of 952 patients were diagnosed with some form of helminthiasis. Among them, 495 were Spanish, and 457 were foreign. The total number of helminths identified, including patients with multiple infections, was 1,010. Significant differences were observed between Africans and Americans in terms of age distribution, with a higher prevalence among Africans in the 0-15 age range and among Americans in the 31-60 age range. Variations were noted in the distribution of helminths, with S. stercoralis significantly affecting Americans. For Spanish patients, the presence of Trichuris trichiura and S. stercoralis was significantly associated with eosinophilia, whereas among foreign patients, it was associated with Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides among others. Regarding symptoms, skin manifestations were more frequent among Spanish, while digestive were more common among foreigners. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers crucial epidemiological insights into helminth infections observed over time in a Madrid hospital. Although the prevalence of helminth infections has been decreasing, there is still a need for screening and diagnosing foreign patients.",

			"article_name": "Assessment of Fetal Exposure and Elimination of Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances: New Evidence from Paired Serum, Placenta, and Meconium Samples.",
			"abstract": "Multiple pieces of evidence have shown that prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is closely related to adverse birth outcomes for infants. However, difficult access to human samples limits our understanding of PFASs transport and metabolism across the human placental barrier, as well as the accurate assessment of fetal PFASs exposure. Herein, we assess fetal exposure to 28 PFASs based on paired serum, placenta, and meconium samples. Overall, 21 PFASs were identified first to be exposed to the fetus prenatally and to be metabolized and excreted by the fetus. In meconium samples, 25 PFASs were detected, with perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid being the dominant congeners, suggesting the metabolism and excretion of PFASs through meconium. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids might be more easily eliminated through the meconium than perfluorinated carboxylic acids. Importantly, based on molecular docking, MRP1, OATP2B1, ASCT1, and P-gp were identified as crucial transporters in the dynamic placental transfer of PFASs between the mother and the fetus. ATSC5p and PubchemFP679 were recognized as critical structural features that affect the metabolism and secretion of PFASs through meconium. With increasing carbon chain length, both the transplacental transfer efficiency and meconium excretion efficiency of PFASs showed a structure-dependent manner. This study reports, for the first time, that meconium, which is a noninvasive and stable biological matrix, can be strong evidence of prenatal PFASs exposure.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: True umbilical cord knot (TUCK) is a rare finding that often leads to intensified surveillance and patient anxiety. This study sought to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of TUCK. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary university medical center in 2007-2019. Patients with singleton pregnancies diagnosed postnatally with TUCK were identified and compared to women without TUCK for obstetric and neonatal outcomes using propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: TUCK was diagnosed in 780 of the 96,766 deliveries (0.8%). Women with TUCK were older than those without TUCK (32.57 vs. 31.06 years, P < 0.001) and had higher gravidity (3 vs. 2, P < 001) and a higher rate of prior stillbirth (1.76% vs. 0.43%, P < 0.01). Following covariate adjustment, 732 women with TUCK were compared to 7320 matched controls. TUCK was associated with emergency cesarean delivery due to non-reassuring fetal heart rate (2.54% vs. 4.35%, P = 0.008, OR 1.71, 95%CI 1.14-2.56) and intrapartum meconium-stained amniotic fluid (19.26% vs. 15.41%, P = 0.022, OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.04-1.65). Neonatal outcomes were comparable except for higher rates of 1-min Apgar score < 7 and neonatal seizures in the TUCK group. The stillbirth rate was higher in the TUCK group, but the difference was not statistically significant (1.23% vs 0.62%, P = 0.06, OR 1.96, 95%CI 0.96-4.03). CONCLUSIONS: TUCK has several identifiable risk factors. Pregnant women with TUCK may cautiously be informed of the relatively low risks of major obstetric or perinatal complications. The lower occurrence of stillbirth in the TUCK group warrants further study.",

			"abstract": "Understanding how maternal diet affects in utero neonatal gut microbiota and epigenetic regulation may provide insight into disease origins and long-term health. The impact of Mediterranean diet pattern adherence (MDA) on fetal gut microbiome and epigenetic regulation was assessed in 33 pregnant women. Participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire in each trimester of pregnancy; the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED) score was applied. Umbilical cord blood, placental tissue, and neonatal meconium were collected from offspring. DNA methylation patterns were probed using the Illumnia EPICarray Methylation Chip in parturients with high versus low MDA. Meconium microbial abundance in the first 24 h after birth was identified using 16s rRNA sequencing and compared among neonates born to mothers with high and low aMED scores. Twenty-one mothers were classified as low MDA and 12 as high MDA. Pasteurellaceae and Bacteroidaceae trended towards greater abundance in the high-MDA group, as well as other short-chain fatty acid-producing species. Several differentially methylated regions varied between groups and overlapped gene regions including NCK2, SNED1, MTERF4, TNXB, HLA-DPB, BAG6, and LMO3. We identified a beneficial effect of adherence to a Mediterranean diet on fetal in utero development. This highlights the importance of dietary counseling for mothers and can be used as a guide for future studies of meconium and immuno-epigenetic modulation.",

However, there is limited information on factors that influence the gut microbiota of very preterm infants. In this study, we analyzed factors that affect the gut microbiota of very preterm infants. The stool samples from 64 very preterm infants with a gestational age less than 32 weeks were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The infants were divided according to the delivery mode, antibiotic use during pregnancy, and feeding methods. The abundance of Proteobacteria was high in both cesarean (92.7%) and spontaneous (55.5%) delivery groups and then shifted to Firmicutes after the first week of birth. In addition, Proteobacteria was also the dominant phylum of infant gut microbiome for mothers with antibiotic use, with more than 50% after the first week of birth. In comparison, the dominant phylum for mothers without antibiotic use was Firmicutes. Proteobacteria level was also high in breastfeeding and mixed-feeding groups, consisting of more than 90% of the community. By contrast, Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum at the first week of birth but then shifted to Firmicutes for the formula-fed group. The alterations of gut microbiota in infants can affect their health condition during growth. This study confirmed that the different feeding types, delivery modes, and use of antibiotics during pregnancy can significantly affect the composition of the gut microbiota of very preterm infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND Neonatal gut diversity is influenced by birth conditions and probiotic/antibiotic use. The gut microbiota affects brain development, immunity, and risk of diseases. Preterm infants, especially in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), have different gut flora from full-term infants, suggesting in utero microbial colonization. This study examined gut microbiota changes in 92 NICU preterm infants in China. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected data on 92 preterm infants admitted to the NICU immediately after birth, and fecal samples were collected on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60. We analyzed changes in intestinal bacteria through 16S rRNA sequencing, predicted the change in gut microbiota function over time, and compared the effects of main feeding modality on the intestinal bacteria of preterm infants. RESULTS At the phylum level, the top 5 phyla in total accounted for 99.69% of the abundance, in decreasing order of abundance: Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes, and Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, the top 10 genera in terms of abundance accounted for a total of 90.90%, in decreasing order of abundance: Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia-Shigella, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus, Clostridium-sensu-stricto-1, Streptococcus, Sphingomonas, and Ureaplasma. The abundance of Proteobacteria and Pseudomonas showed a decreasing trend at first, reached a minimum at day 14, and then an increasing trend, while the opposite trend was observed for Firmicutes. The metabolic function of the bacterial community changed greatly at different time points. The abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Streptococcus at the genus level in formula-fed infants were significantly higher than in breast-fed infants. CONCLUSIONS Between 1 and 60 days, the gut microbiome in preterm infants in the NICU changed with changes in feeding patterns, with the main gut bacteria being from the phyla, Proteobacteria, and Pseudomonas.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are limited longitudinal data on the acquisition of Giardia lamblia infections in childhood using molecular assays to detect and type assemblages, and measure effects of infections on diarrhea risk and childhood growth. METHODS: We analysed stool samples from a surveillance sample within a birth cohort in a rural district in tropical Ecuador. The cohort was followed to 8 years of age for the presence of G. lamblia in stools by quantitative PCR and A and B assemblages by Taqman assay or Sanger sequencing. We explored risk factors associated with infection using generalized estimating equations applied to longitudinal binary outcomes, and longitudinal panel data analysis to estimate effects of infection on diarrhea and growth trajectories. RESULTS: 2,812 stool samples collected between 1 month and 8 years of age from 498 children were analyzed and showed high rates of infection: 79.7% were infected at least once with peak prevalence (53.9%) at 5 years. Assemblage B was accounted for 56.8% of genotyped infections. Risk factors for infection included male sex (P = 0.001), daycare attendance (P<0.001), having a household latrine (P = 0.04), childhood (P<0.001) and maternal soil-transmitted helminth (P = 0.029) infections, and exposures to donkeys (age interaction P = 0.034). G. lamblia was associated with increased risk of diarrhea (per episode, RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, P = 0.011) during the first 3 years of life and a transient impairment of weight (age interaction P = 0.017) and height-for-age (age interaction P = 0.025) trajectories between 1 and 4 years of age. There was no increased risk of either assemblage being associated with outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our data show a relatively high edemicity of G. lamblia transmission during childhood in coastal Ecuador, and evidence that infection is associated with a transiently increased risk of diarrhea during the first 3 years of life and impairment of weight and height between 1 and 4 years.",

			"abstract": "RNA viruses are a major group contributing to emerging infectious diseases and neonatal diarrhoea, causing morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. Hence, the present study investigated the metatranscriptomic-derived faecal RNA virome in rotavirus group A (RVA)-infected diarrheic piglets and calves from India. The viral genomes retrieved belonged to Astroviridae in both species, while Reoviridae and Picornaviridae were found only in piglets. The nearly complete genomes of porcine RVA (2), astrovirus (AstV) (6), enterovirus G (EVG) (2), porcine sapelovirus (PSV) (2), Aichivirus C (1), and porcine teschovirus (PTV) (1) were identified and characterised. In the piglet, AstVs of PAstV2 (MAstV-26) and PAstV4 (MAstV-31) lineages were predominant, followed by porcine RVA, EVG, PSV, Aichivirus C, teschovirus (PTV-17) in decreasing order of sequence reads. In contrast, AstV accounted for the majority of reads in bovines and belonged to MAstV-28 and a proposed MAstV-35. Both RVA G4P[6] strains exhibited prototype Gottfried strains like a genotypic constellation of G4-P[6]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. Ten out of eleven genes were of porcine origin, while the VP7 gene clustered with G4-lineage-1, consisting of human strains, suggesting a natural porcine-human reassortant. In the recombination analysis, multiple recombination events were detected in the PAstV4 and PAstV2 genomes, pointing out that these viruses were potential recombinants. Finally, the study finds diverse RNA virome in Indian piglets and calves for the first time, which may have contributed to diarrhoea. In the future, the investigation of RNA virome in animals will help in revealing pathogen diversity in multifactorial diseases, disease outbreaks, monitoring circulating viruses, viral discovery, and evaluation of their zoonotic potential.",

			"abstract": "The molecular mechanisms regulating homeostasis in the developing fetus have not been satisfactorily elucidated. Meconium contains substances accumulated in the fetal intestines. Measurements of transferrin and ferritin concentrations in meconium and assessment of transferrin-ferritin relationships could enhance knowledge about specific processes of the intrauterine period involving the two proteins and their effects on the development and growth of the fetus. Transferrin and ferritin concentrations were measured by ELISA in the homogenates of first meconium portions from 125 neonates. Higher birth weight was associated with lower ferritin concentrations in meconium (r = -0.22, p = 0.015). In neonates with a birth weight of more than 3750 g, there was a positive correlation between transferrin and ferritin concentrations (r = 0.51, p = 0.003). With meconium transferrin concentrations above 43.52 microg/g, a negative correlation between transferrin and ferritin was established (r = -0.37, p = 0.036), while with transferrin concentrations below 43.52 microg/g, the correlations between the birth weight and the meconium transferrin and ferritin concentrations were negative (r = -0.61, p < 0.001 and r = -0.43, p = 0.017, respectively). Measurements of transferrin and ferritin in meconium specimens create a new use for these common biomarkers to improve our understanding of the effects of homeostasis in utero on the fetal development and growth. Establishing reference ranges of meconium transferrin and ferritin concentrations and their association with the clinical parameters during pregnancy could aid in the assessment of the impact of intrauterine life on the health status of the neonate and its adaptation to extrauterine life.",

Meconium is often the preferred specimen type to detect neonatal drug exposure due to a longer window of detection compared to urine, but most laboratories send out meconium testing to specialized reference laboratories, which can delay results for several days or more. Here, we evaluate a rapid and definitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for neonatal urine drug testing and compare results obtained using this method to paired meconium drug testing in 1,424 neonates for amphetamines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates, oxycodone and phencyclidine. Urine testing showed equivalent sensitivity to current meconium methods for detecting in utero exposure to amphetamines and cocaine.",

			"abstract": "Alterations in the diversity and relative abundances of the gut microbiome have been associated with a broad spectrum of medical conditions. Maternal psychological symptoms during pregnancy may impact on offspring development by altering the maternal and the foetal gut microbiome. We aimed to investigate whether self-reported maternal anxiety, depressive symptoms, and distress as well as saliva cortisol levels in late pregnancy alter the bacterial composition of the infant's meconium. METHODS: A total of N = 100 mother-infant pairs were included. Maternal psychological symptoms were measured using psychological questionnaires (EPDS, PSS-10, STAI) at 34-36 weeks gestation and salivary cortisol was measured at 34-36 and 38 weeks gestation. Infant meconium samples were collected in the first five days postpartum and analysed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: Correlations showed that lower alpha diversity of the meconium microbiome was significantly associated with increased maternal prenatal depressive symptoms in late gestation (tau = -0.15, p = .04). Increased saliva cortisol AUCg at T2 was significantly related to higher beta diversity of the meconium samples (Pr(>F) = 0.003*). Pseudomonas was the most abundant phylum and was associated with maternal saliva cortisol total decline. No other associations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal prenatal depressive symptoms are associated with infant faecal microbiome alpha diversity, whereas maternal saliva cortisol AUCg is linked to increased beta diversity and total decline related to increased Psuedomonas. Future studies are warranted to understand how these microbiota community alterations are linked to child health outcomes.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypospadias is a male genital tract defect for which an increase in prevalence has been documented over the last few decades. A role for environmental risk factors is suspected, including prenatal exposure to pesticides. OBJECTIVES: To study the risk of hypospadias in association with multiple pesticide measurements in meconium samples. METHODS: The Brittany Registry of Congenital Anomalies (France) conducted a case-control study between 2012 and 2018. Cases were hypospadias, ascertained by a pediatrician and a pediatric surgeon, excluding genetic conditions, following European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies guidelines (N = 69). Controls (N = 135) were two male infants without congenital anomaly born after each case in the same maternity unit. Mothers in the maternity units completed a self-administered questionnaire, we collected medical data from hospital records, and medical staff collected meconium samples. We performed chemical analysis of 38 pesticides (parent compound and/or metabolite) by UHPLC/MS/MS following strict quality assurance/quality control criteria and blind to case-control status. We carried out logistic regression accounting for frequency-matching variables and major risk factors. RESULTS: Among the 38 pesticides measured, 16 (42%) were never detected in the meconium samples, 18 (47%) were in <5% of samples, and 4 (11%) in >/=5% of the samples. We observed an association between the detection of fenitrothion in meconium and the risk of hypospadias (OR = 2.6 [1.0-6.3] with n cases = 13, n controls = 21), but not the other pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: Our small study provides a robust assessment of fetal exposure. Fenitrothion's established antiandrogenic activities provide biologic plausibility for our observations. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

			"abstract": "It has been found that intestinal fungi play a role in the composition of the intestinal microecology and in the formation and development of the immunity during childhood. We investigated the gut fungi composition of preterm infants to analysis composition and dynamics of intestinal fungi during the postnatal 2 months of very low birth weight infants. We collected feces from 34 very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) and 28 preterm infants with birth weight >1500 g. We extracted total fungal DNA from feces and analyzed the composition of gut fungus through ITS sequencing. The fungal detectable rate in the experimental group peaked on day 3 (85.19%), then gradually decreased and started to show an increasing trend again by day 28. There were significant differences in the alpha diversity of intestinal fungus between VLBWI and controls, and the VLBWI had its own characteristics at different time points in richness and diversity. A total of 10 phylums and 342 genera were identified in all VLBWI samples. The dominant fungal phylum of the VLBWI group is Ascomycota (50.3%)and Basidiomycota (48.8%). The functional metabolic activity of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: The composition and abundance of VLBWI intestinal fungal showed several alterations during the first 2 months of life. The prediction of gut microbiota function suggests that intestinal metabolic function may be altered in VLBWI. WHAT IS KNOWN: * A limited number of studies has been found that symbiont fungi may be able to calibrate host immunological responses, promote development of peripheral lymphoid organs, promote T cell responses, and even may be associated with the development of certain diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), NEC, and allergic diseases. However, previous studies on intestinal microecology have mainly focused on adults while neglecting the role of fungi in the gut of children due to the much lower abundance of intestinal fungi than bacteria, limitations of techniques for detecting fungi, the difficulty of obtaining samples, and the absence of largescale reference databases. WHAT IS NEW: * In recent years, the discovery and development of fungal detection technologies such as 18s rDNA sequencing technology, Internal Transcribed Spacer(ITS), and DNA fingerprinting technology have further broadened the perspective on the impact of intestinal fungal exposure in early life.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The first-pass meconium has been suggested as a proxy for the fetal gut microbiota because it is formed in utero. This systematic review and cohort study investigated how pre- and perinatal factors influence the composition of the meconium microbiota. METHODS: We performed the systematic review using Covidence by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with the search terms \"meconium microbiome\" and \"meconium microbiota\". In the cohort study, we performed 16 S rRNA gene sequencing on 393 meconium samples and analyzed the sequencing data using QIIME2. RESULTS: Our systematic review identified 69 studies exploring prenatal factors, immediate perinatal factors, and microbial composition in relation to subsequent health of infants but gave only limited comparative evidence regarding factors related to the composition of the meconium microbiota. The cohort study pointed to a low-biomass microbiota consisting of the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota and the genera Staphylococcus, Escherichia-Shigella and Lactobacillus, and indicated that immediate perinatal factors affected the composition of the meconium microbiota more than did prenatal factors. CONCLUSIONS: This finding supports the idea that the meconium microbiota mostly starts developing during delivery. IMPACT: It is unclear when the first-pass meconium microbiota develops, and what are the sources of the colonization. In this systematic review, we found 69 studies exploring prenatal factors, immediate perinatal factors, and microbial composition relative to subsequent health of infants, but there was no consensus on the factors affecting the meconium microbiota development. In this cohort study, immediate perinatal factors markedly affected the meconium microbiota development while prenatal factors had little effect on it. As the meconium microbiota composition was influenced by immediate perinatal factors, the present study supports the idea that the initial gut microbiota develops mainly during delivery.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The passage of meconium during labor increased the chance of undesirable birth outcomes. The adverse effects of meconium are worsening in resource-limited countries. In Ethiopia, there is an argument concerning meconium's negative effects and management on pregnant women and their babies. Therefore, this study was intended to assess the adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes of meconium in term labor in the South Gondar Zone, Ethiopia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted using 580 laboring mothers (145 exposed and 435 nonexposed groups). A two-stage sampling method was implemented to get study subjects. The data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and a medical chart review. SPSS version 25 was used for data analysis. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the two groups' differences. The strength of the association was measured using relative risk with a 95% CI. RESULT: There was more operative delivery (28.3% versus 5.3%), puerperal sepsis (79.54% versus 2.06%), nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern (29.7% versus 2.1%), meconium aspiration syndrome (7.58% versus 0.68%), neonatal sepsis (9% versus 4.1%), perinatal asphyxia (13.8% versus 7.6%), admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (23.4% versus 3.2%), and early neonatal deaths (4.8% versus 1.4%) among meconium stained groups as compared to the clear amniotic fluid groups. CONCLUSION: Meconium-stained amniotic fluid significantly increased adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in Ethiopia. The risk of perinatal asphyxia, nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern, neonatal sepsis, meconium aspiration syndrome, admission to the NICU, early neonatal death, operative delivery, and puerperal sepsis were significantly higher in meconium-exposed groups.

However, how it transmits from mother to child is still being determined. Vaginal yeast often transmits to neonates during delivery. Therefore, H. pylori hosted in yeast might follow the same transmission route. This study aimed to detect intracellular H. pylori in vaginal and fecal yeasts isolates and explore the role of yeast in H. pylori transmission. Yeast was isolated from the mothers' vaginal discharge and neonates' feces and identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. H. pylori 16S rRNA and antigen were detected in yeast isolates by polymerase chain reaction and direct immunofluorescence assay. Genetic relationships of Candida strains isolated from seven mothers and their corresponding neonates were determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting and ITS alignment. The Candida isolates from four mother-neonate pairs had identical RAPD patterns and highly homologous ITS sequences. The current study showed H. pylori could be sheltered within yeast colonizing the vagina, and fecal yeast from neonates is genetically related to the vaginal yeast from their mothers. Thus, vaginal yeast presents a potential reservoir of H. pylori and plays a vital role in the transmission from mother to neonate.",

			"abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide, seriously endangering human health. Although SARS-CoV-2 had a lower impact on paediatric population, children with COVID-19 have been reported as suffering from gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms at a higher rate than adults. The aim of this work was to evaluate faeces as a source of potential biomarkers of severity in the paediatric population, with an emphasis on intestinal microbiota and faecal immune mediators, trying to identify possible dysbiosis and immune intestinal dysfunction associated with the risk of hospitalization. This study involved 19 patients with COVID-19 under 24 months of age hospitalized during the pandemic at 6 different hospitals in Spain, and it included a comparable age-matched healthy control group (n = 18). Patients and controls were stratified according to their age in two groups: newborns or young infants (from 0 to 3 months old) and toddlers (infants from 6 to 24 months old). To characterize microbial intestinal communities, sequencing with Illumina technology of total 16S rDNA amplicons and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons of bifidobacteria were used. Faecal calprotectin (FC) and a range of human cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured in faecal samples using ELISA and a multiplex system. Significant reduction in the abundance of sequences belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria was found in those infants with COVID-19, as well as in the Bifidobacteriaceae family. A different pattern of bifidobacteria was observed in patients, mainly represented by lower percentages of Bifidobacterium breve, as compared with controls. In the group of hospitalized young infants, FC was almost absent compared to age-matched healthy controls. A lower prevalence in faecal excretion of immune factors in these infected patients was also observed. CONCLUSION:  Hospitalized infants with COVID-19 were depleted in some gut bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, in particular Bifidobacterium breve, which is crucial for the proper establishment of a functional intestinal microbiota, and important for the development of a competent immune system. Our results point to a possible immature immune system at intestine level in young infants infected by SARS-CoV2 requiring hospitalization. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Although SARS-CoV-2 had a lower impact on paediatric population, children with COVID-19 have been reported as suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms at a higher rate than adults. * Changes in microbial composition have been described in COVID-19 adult patients, although studies in children are limited. WHAT IS NEW: * The first evidence that hospitalized infants with COVID-19 during the pandemic had a depletion in bifidobacteria, particularly in Bifidobacterium breve, beneficial gut bacteria in infancy that are crucial for the proper establishment of a competent immune system. * In young infants (under 3 months of age) hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection, the aberrant bifidobacterial profile appears to overlap with a poor intestinal immune development as seen by calprotectin and the trend of immunological factors excreted in faeces.",

The current study investigated the ongoing effects of subclinical PAE in adolescence. METHODS: A sample of n = 96 mother-child dyads of the FRAMES/FRANCES cohort were classified into PAE/no PAE using EtG with a 10 ng/g cutoff. Mothers were recruited during pregnancy and children were assessed during primary-school age (M = 7.57, SD = 0.65, range: 6.00-9.92 years) and adolescence (M = 13.26, SD = 0.31, range: 12.79-14.20 years) on three levels: clinical (ADHD rating), neuropsychological (IQ score and performance in a go/nogo task), and neurophysiological (analysis of P3 event-related potentials (ERP) during said go/nogo task). Developmental outcomes and courses following PAE were assessed using rmANCOVAs, controlling for relevant confounders (socioeconomic status (SES), birth weight, and maternal psychopathology). RESULTS: Neurophysiological impairments emerged for exposed children in the form of diminished attentional resource recruiting in childhood and adolescence (reduced go-P3 amplitudes) with no differences in performance. Neuropsychological testing showed a reduced IQ score for both time points with dose-dependent effects in childhood. Clinical ADHD symptoms were not significantly affected. CONCLUSION: Subclinical PAE, as determined by meconium EtG, has negative developmental consequences on cognitive function that persist from childhood to adolescence. These findings suggest that there is no safe limit for alcohol consumption during pregnancy and that more thorough screening of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is necessary for early identification and treatment of at-risk children.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Norovirus is a major cause of endemic acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. We described the epidemiology, risk factors, and genotypic distribution of noroviruses among hospitalized patients of all ages in Bangladesh. METHODS: From March 2018 to October 2021, 1250 AGE case patients and controls (age, sex, season, and site matched) were enrolled at 10 hospitals. Demographic and clinical information was collected; real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used to test stool specimens, and positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: Norovirus was detected in 9% of cases (111 of 1250) and 15% (182 of 1250) of controls. Eighty-two percent of norovirus-positive cases were in children <5 years old. Norovirus-positive AGE hospitalizations occurred year-round, with peaks in April and October. Risk factors for norovirus included age <5 years (adjusted odds ratio, 3.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-5.2]) and exposure to a patient with AGE in the 10 days before enrollment (3.8 [1.9-7.2]). GII.3[P16] and GII.4 Sydney[P16] were the predominant genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the burden of norovirus in hospital settings. Young age and recent exposure to a patient with AGE were risk factors for norovirus. A high prevalence of norovirus among controls might represent asymptomatic reinfections or prolonged shedding from a previous infection; carefully designed longitudinal studies are needed to improve our understanding of norovirus infections in Bangladesh.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probiotic supplementation is increasingly being given to very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. This preliminary observational study aimed to investigate the effects of multiple-strain probiotics on the gut microbiota of VLBW preterm infants. METHODS: We collected meconium and stool samples on days 14, 30, and 60 after birth from 49 VLBW infants with a gestational age of <32 weeks. The infants were divided into the probiotics (n = 24) and control (n = 25) groups. The microbial composition and diversity in the gut of the two groups were analyzed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the control group on days 14, 30, and 60 (Bifidobacterium: p = 0.002, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively; Lactobacillus: p = 0.012, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively). The control group exhibited a significantly higher proportion of participants with a low abundance (<1%) of Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus on days 14, 30, and 60 than those in the probiotic group. Moreover, the probiotics group exhibited a significantly lower abundance of Klebsiella on days 14 and 30 (2.4% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.037; and 7.9% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.032, respectively) and of Escherichia-Shigella on day 60 than the control group (6.1% vs. 12.3%, p = 0.013). Beta diversity analysis revealed that the microbiota profile was clearly divided into two groups on days 30 and 60 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation significantly increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and inhibited the growth of potential pathogens. Furthermore, probiotic supplementation led to a distinct gut microbiota profile. Further research is needed to identify probiotic strains that exert significant influence on the gut microbiome and their long-term health implications in preterm infants.",

			"abstract": "The benefits of routine gastric suctioning or lavage in neonates remain uncertain, despite the common practice worldwide. To investigate the potential advantages and harms, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of these procedures in healthy or meconium-stained neonates at birth. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library databases from inception to February 9, 2023. We included only RCTs assessing the outcomes of gastric suction or lavage in neonates at birth. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, retching, feeding intolerance, and secondary aspiration. The secondary outcomes included time to initiation of breastfeeding and potential adverse procedure-related events. Twelve RCTs with a total of 4,122 neonates were analyzed. All the studies compared neonates who received gastric suction or lavage with those who received usual care. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly reduced in neonates receiving gastric suction or gastric lavage compared with the control group (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.89). Gastric lavage was beneficial for infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (RR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84), while gastric suction had no significant benefit in reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in infants without meconium-stained amniotic fluid (RR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.61-1.37). Our findings suggest that gastric suction or lavage may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in neonates; however, these procedures may only benefit infants born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Vigorous newborns without meconium-stained amniotic fluid may not benefit from these procedures. Furthermore, gastric suction may lead to adverse outcomes such as apnea and bradycardia.

The assembly of the gut microbiome is highly dynamic, and influenced by many postnatal factors, moreover, little is known about the development of the gut metabolome. We showed that geography has an important influence on the microbiome dynamics in the first year of life based on two independent cohorts from China and Sweden. Major compositional differences since birth were the high relative abundance of Bacteroides in the Swedish cohort and Streptococcus in the Chinese cohort. We analyzed the development of the fecal metabolome in the first year of life in the Chinese cohort. Lipid metabolism, especially acylcarnitines and bile acids, was the most abundant metabolic pathway in the newborn gut. Delivery mode and feeding induced particular differences in the gut metabolome since birth. In contrast to C-section newborns, medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines were abundant at newborn age only in vaginally delivered infants, associated by the presence of bacteria such as Bacteroides vulgatus and Parabacteroides merdae. Our data provide a basis for understanding the maturation of the fecal metabolome and the metabolic role of gut microbiota in infancy.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to study the strength of the association between meconium-stained amniotic fluid and severe morbidity among neonates of nulliparas with prolonged pregnancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the NOCETER randomized trial that took place between 2009 and 2012 in which 11 French maternity units included 1373 nulliparas at 41(+0)  weeks of gestation onwards with a single live fetus in cephalic presentation. This analysis excluded patients with a cesarean delivery before labor and those with bloody amniotic fluid or of unreported consistency. The principal end point was a composite criterion of severe neonatal morbidity (neonatal death, 5-minute Apgar <7, convulsions in the first 24 h, meconium aspiration syndrome, mechanical ventilation >/=24 h, or neonatal intensive care unit admission for 5 days or more). The neonatal outcomes of pregnancies with thin or thick meconium-stained amniotic fluid were compared with those with normal amniotic fluid. The association between the consistency of the amniotic fluid and neonatal morbidity was tested by univariate and then multivariate analysis adjusted for gestational age at birth, duration of labor, and country of birth. RESULTS: This study included 1274 patients: 803 (63%) in the group with normal amniotic fluid, 196 (15.4%) in the thin amniotic fluid group, and 275 (21.6%) in the thick amniotic fluid group. The neonates of patients with thick amniotic fluid had higher rates of neonatal morbidity than those of patients with normal amniotic fluid (7.3% vs. 2.2%; p < 0.001; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-6.3), but those of patients with thin amniotic fluid did not (3.1% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.50; aRR 1.0, 95% CI, 0.4-2.7). CONCLUSIONS: Among nulliparas at 41(+0)  weeks onwards, only thick meconium-stained amniotic fluid is associated with a higher rate of severe neonatal morbidity.",

			"article_name": "Birth Mode Does Not Determine the Presence of Shared Bacterial Strains between the Maternal Vaginal Microbiome and the Infant Stool Microbiome.",
			"abstract": "Dysbiosis of the neonatal gut microbiome during early life has been suggested as the missing link that may explain higher rates of certain diseases in caesarean section-delivered infants. Many studies report delivery mode-related dysbiosis in infants due to a lack of maternal vaginal microbiome exposure, prompting interventions to correct the neonatal gut microbiome by transferring these missing microbes after caesarean delivery. The maternal vaginal microbiome is among the first microbial exposures that many infants experience, yet little is known about the extent of direct transmission of maternal vaginal microbes. As part of the Maternal Microbiome Legacy Project, we aimed to determine if maternal vaginal bacteria are vertically transmitted to infants. We employed cpn60 microbiome profiling, culture-based screening, molecular strain typing, and whole-genome sequencing to determine whether identical maternal vaginal strains were present in infant stool microbiomes. We identified identical cpn60 sequence variants in both halves of maternal-infant dyads in 204 of 585 Canadian women and their newborn infants (38.9%). The same species of Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus were cultured from maternal and corresponding infant samples in 33 and 13 of these mother-infant dyads, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole-genome sequencing determined that near-identical strains were detected in these dyads irrespective of delivery mode, indicating an alternative source in cases of caesarean delivery. Overall, we demonstrated that vertical transmission of maternal vaginal microbiota is likely limited and that transmission from other maternal body sites, such as the gut and breast milk, may compensate for the lack of maternal vaginal microbiome exposure during caesarean delivery. IMPORTANCE The importance of the gut microbiome in human health and disease is widely recognized, and there has been a growing appreciation that alterations in gut microbiome composition during a \"critical window\" of development may impact health in later life. Attempts to correct gut microbiome dysbiosis related to birth mode are underpinned by the assumption that the lack of exposure to maternal vaginal microbes during caesarean delivery is responsible for dysbiosis. Here, we demonstrate that there is limited transmission of the maternal vaginal microbiome to the neonatal gut, even in cases of vaginal delivery. Furthermore, the presence of identical strains shared between mothers and infants in early life, even in cases of caesarean delivery, highlights compensatory microbial exposures and sources for the neonatal stool microbiome other than the maternal vagina.",

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review including cross-sectional, observational, and interventional studies published in English, that reported on defecation frequency and/or stool consistency in healthy children 0-4 years old. RESULTS: Seventy-five studies were included with 16 393 children and 40 033 measurements of defecation frequency and/or stool consistency. Based on visual inspection of defecation frequency data, a differentiation was made between two age categories: young infants (0-14 weeks old) and young children (15 weeks-4 years old). Young infants had a mean defecation frequency of 21.8 per week (95 % CI, 3.9-35.2) compared with 10.9 (CI, 5.7-16.7) in young children (P < .001). Among young infants, human milk-fed (HMF) infants had the highest mean defecation frequency per week (23.2 [CI, 8.8-38.1]), followed by formula-fed (FF) infants (13.7 [CI 5.4-23.9]), and mixed-fed (MF) infants (20.7 [CI, 7.0-30.2]). Hard stools were infrequently reported in young infants (1.5%) compared with young children (10.5%), and a reduction in the frequency of soft/watery stools was observed with higher age (27.0% in young infants compared with 6.2% in young children). HMF young infants had softer stools compared with FF young infants. CONCLUSIONS: Young infants (0-14 weeks old) have softer and more frequent stools compared with young children (15 weeks-4 years old).",

Sixty-eight cesarean-delivered infants were randomly assigned a VMT or saline gauze intervention immediately after delivery in a triple-blind manner (ChiCTR2000031326). Adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups. Infant neurodevelopment, as measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) score at 6 months, was significantly higher with VMT than saline. VMT significantly accelerated gut microbiota maturation and regulated levels of certain fecal metabolites and metabolic functions, including carbohydrate, energy, and amino acid metabolisms, within 42 days after birth.

			"abstract": "In our previous cross-sectional study, multiple species of Campylobacter were detected (88%) in stool samples from children (12 to 14 months of age) in rural eastern Ethiopia. This study assessed the temporal fecal carriage of Campylobacter in infants and identified putative reservoirs associated with these infections in infants from the same region. The prevalence and load of Campylobacter were determined using genus-specific real-time PCR. Stool samples from 106 infants (n = 1,073) were collected monthly from birth until 376 days of age (DOA). Human stool samples (mothers and siblings), livestock feces (cattle, chickens, goats, and sheep), and environmental samples (soil and drinking water) from the 106 households were collected twice per household (n = 1,644). Campylobacter was most prevalent in livestock feces (goats, 99%; sheep, 98%; cattle, 99%; chickens, 93%), followed by human stool samples (siblings, 91%; mothers, 83%; infants, 64%) and environmental samples (soil, 58%; drinking water, 43%). The prevalence of Campylobacter in infant stool samples significantly increased with age, from 30% at 27 DOA to 89% at 360 DOA (1% increase/day in the odds of being colonized) (P < 0.001). The Campylobacter load increased linearly (P < 0.001) with age from 2.95 logs at 25 DOA to 4.13 logs at 360 DOA. Within a household, the Campylobacter load in infant stool samples was positively correlated with the load in mother stool samples (r(2) = 0.18) and soil collected inside the house (r(2) = 0.36), which were in turn both correlated with Campylobacter loads in chicken and cattle feces (0.60 < r(2) < 0.63) (P < 0.01). In conclusion, a high proportion of infants are infected with Campylobacter in eastern Ethiopia, and contact with the mother and contaminated soil may be associated with early infections. IMPORTANCE A high Campylobacter prevalence during early childhood has been associated with environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) and stunting, especially in low-resource settings. Our previous study demonstrated that Campylobacter was frequently found (88%) in children from eastern Ethiopia; however, little is known about potential Campylobacter reservoirs and transmission pathways leading to infection of infants by Campylobacter during early growth. In the longitudinal study presented here, Campylobacter was frequently detected in infants within the 106 surveyed households from eastern Ethiopia, and the prevalence was age dependent. Furthermore, preliminary analyses highlighted the potential role of the mother, soil, and livestock in the transmission of Campylobacter to the infant. Further work will explore the species and genetic composition of Campylobacter in infants and putative reservoirs using PCR and whole-genome and metagenomic sequencing. The findings from these studies can lead to the development of interventions to minimize the risk of transmission of Campylobacter to infants and, potentially, EED and stunting.",

METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in infants with a gestational age of <32 weeks or birth weight <1,500 g with weekly feces collection. The relationships between FC, NEC, and FI were investigated, adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: A total of 1,086 fecal samples were collected from 194 preterm infants. Postnatal FC levels of non-NEC infants were highly variable and followed an age-dependent patterned progression. FC levels were elevated in patients with NEC before and at NEC onset, distinguishing them from non-NEC infants and those at sepsis onset. Among infants without NEC or sepsis, those with FI exhibited lower FC concentrations throughout hospitalization and displayed a significant delay in reaching high FC levels after meconium compared with non-FI infants. The age to reach the first high nonmeconial FC levels was positively associated with the time to achieve full enteral feeding. DISCUSSION: Postnatal FC dynamics among premature infants followed a patterned progression but were disturbed in patients with NEC and FI. Because of the high variations, the use of FC levels in NEC diagnosis should be implemented with caution in clinical practice. FC may help understand FI and feeding progression in very preterm infants. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the potential clinical applications of FC in this population.",

We aimed to determine if gestational PM(1) exposure is associated with the gut microbiota of mothers and neonates. METHODS: Leveraging a mother-infant cohort from the central region of China, we estimated the exposure concentrations of PM(1) during pregnancy based on residential address records. The gut microbiota of mothers and neonates was analyzed using 16 S rRNA V3-V4 gene sequences. Functional pathway analyses of 16 S rRNA V3-V4 bacterial communities were conducted using Tax4fun. The impact of PM(1) exposure on alpha-diversity, composition, and function of gut microbiota in mothers and neonates was evaluated using multiple linear regression, controlling for nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)). Permutation multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to analyze the interpretation degree of PM(1) on the sample differences at the OTU level using the Bray-Curtis distance algorithm. RESULTS: Gestational PM(1) exposure was positively associated with the alpha-diversity of gut microbiota in neonates and explained 14.8% (adj. P = 0.026) of the differences in community composition among neonatal samples. In contrast, gestational PM(1) exposure had no impact on the alpha- and beta-diversity of gut microbiota in mothers.

At Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway level 3, the functional analysis results showed that gestational PM(1) exposure significantly down-regulated Nitrogen metabolism in mothers, as well as Two-component system and Pyruvate metabolism in neonates. While Purine metabolism, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, Pyrimidine metabolism, and Ribosome in neonates were significantly up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence that exposure to PM(1) has a significant impact on the gut microbiota of mothers and neonates, especially on the diversity, composition, and function of neonatal meconium microbiota, which may have important significance for maternal health management in the future.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus group A (RVA) is a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis among young children worldwide, despite the global expansion of rotavirus vaccination. In Korea, although the prevalence of RVA has been reduced among young children owing to vaccination, nosocomial infections still occur among neonates. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of RVA strains associated with several neonatal outbreaks in Seoul from 2017 to 2020. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and environmental samples were collected and screened for the presence of RVA using ELISA and PCR targeting VP6, respectively. RVA-positive strains were genotyped via RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing of VP4 and VP7 and were phylogenetically compared with RVA strains from other countries. RESULTS: During 2017-2020, a total of 15 RVA outbreaks occurred at neonatal facilities (six in hospital neonatal wards and nine in postpartum care centers) in Seoul, and only two RVA genotypes were detected: G4P[6] and G8P[6]. G8P[6] emerged in Seoul November 2018 and immediately became the predominant genotype among neonates, at least up to 2020. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the G8P[6] genotype in this study was closely related to G8P[6] strains first identified in Korea in 2017, but differed from G8P[6] strains detected in Africa. CONCLUSIONS: A novel G8P[6] genotype of RVA strains has emerged and caused outbreaks among neonates in Seoul. Continued surveillance for circulating RVA genotypes is imperative to monitor genotype changes and their potential risks to public health.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of gastric lavage on exclusive breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact in neonates delivered through MSAF. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 110 late preterm and term neonates delivered through MSAF not requiring resuscitation beyond initial steps. METHODS: Participants randomized into gastric lavage (GL) (n=55) and no-GL (n=55) groups. The primary outcome was the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 72+/-12 hours of life. Secondary outcomes were time to initiate breastfeeding and establish exclusive breastfeeding, rate of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge, time to initiate skin-to-skin contact and its duration, rates of respiratory distress, feeding intolerance, and the procedure-related complications of gastric lavage monitored by pulse oximetry and videography. RESULTS: Both the groups were similar in baseline characteristics. 49 (89.1%) neonates in GL group could achieve exclusive breast-feeding at 72 hours compared to 48 (87.3%) in no-GL group [RR (95% CI) 1.02 (0.89-1.17); P=0.768]. Initiation of skin-to-skin contact was significantly delayed and the total duration was significantly less in GL group compared to no-GL group. No difference in respi-ratory distress and feeding intolerance was observed. Procedure-related complications included retching, vomiting, and mild desaturation. CONCLUSION: Gastric lavage did not help to establish exclusive breastfeeding, delayed the initiation of skin-to-skin contact in delivery room and reduced its total duration. Moreover, the procedure of gastric lavage was associated with neonatal discomfort.",

Understanding the link between maternal prenatal bonding, early gut microbiota, and neuropsychological development may promote healthy development in early life. This study included 306 mother-child pairs. Women were assessed for maternal antenatal bonding using the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale in all three trimesters of pregnancy. Neonatal meconium samples were collected after birth. The behavioral temperament of infants was measured using the Very Short Form of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised at 6 months postpartum. Maternal prenatal bonding was negatively associated with the infants' relative abundance of Burkholderia and was positively associated with the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, infant surgency and effortful control. The infant's relative abundance of Burkholderia mediates the association between maternal prenatal bonding and effortful control of the infant. This study provides new evidence about the long-term behavioral implications of a prenatally positive intrauterine environment in offspring microbiomes. The integration of maternal bonding assessment and intervention into prenatal healthcare and wellness models may modulate the establishment of gut microbiota in early life and long-term neuropsychological development in infants.",

			"abstract": "Intestinal colonization with Klebsiella has been linked to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), but methods of analysis usually failed to discriminate Klebsiella species or strains. A novel ~ 2500-base amplicon (StrainID) that spans the 16S and 23S rRNA genes was used to generate amplicon sequence variant (ASV) fingerprints for Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae species complexes (KoSC and KpSC, respectively) and co-occurring fecal bacterial strains from 10 preterm infants with NEC and 20 matched controls. Complementary approaches were used to identify cytotoxin-producing isolates of KoSC. Klebsiella species colonized most preterm infants, were more prevalent in NEC subjects versus controls, and replaced Escherichia in NEC subjects. Single KoSC or KpSC ASV fingerprinted strains dominated the gut microbiota, suggesting exclusionary Klebsiella competition for luminal resources. Enterococcus faecalis was co-dominant with KoSC but present infrequently with KpSC. Cytotoxin-producing KoSC members were identified in most NEC subjects and were less frequent in controls. Few Klebsiella strains were shared between subjects. We conclude that inter-species Klebsiella competition, within an environment of KoSC and E. faecalis cooperation, appears to be an important factor for the development of NEC. Preterm infants seem to acquire Klebsiella primarily through routes other than patient-to-patient transmission.",

			"article_name": "Exploring Molecular Interactions between Human Milk Hormone Insulin and Bifidobacteria.",
			"abstract": "Multiple millennia of human evolution have shaped the chemical composition of breast milk toward an optimal human body fluid for nutrition and protection and for shaping the early gut microbiota of newborns. This biological fluid is composed of water, lipids, simple and complex carbohydrates, proteins, immunoglobulins, and hormones. Potential interactions between hormones present in mother's milk and the microbial community of the newborn are a very fascinating yet unexplored topic. In this context, insulin, in addition to being one of the most prevalent hormones in breast milk, is also involved in a metabolic disease that affects many pregnant women, i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Analysis of 3,620 publicly available metagenomic data sets revealed that the bifidobacterial community varies in relation to the different concentrations of this hormone in breast milk of healthy and diabetic mothers. Starting from this assumption, in this study, we explored possible molecular interactions between this hormone and bifidobacterial strains that represent bifidobacterial species commonly occurring in the infant gut using 'omics' approaches. Our findings revealed that insulin modulates the bifidobacterial community by apparently improving the persistence of the Bifidobacterium bifidum taxon in the infant gut environment compared to other typical infant-associated bifidobacterial species. IMPORTANCE Breast milk is a key factor in modulating the infant's intestinal microbiota composition. Even though the interaction between human milk sugars and bifidobacteria has been extensively studied, there are other bioactive compounds in human milk that may influence the gut microbiota, such as hormones. In this article, the molecular interaction of the human milk hormone insulin and the bifidobacterial communities colonizing the human gut in the early stages of life has been explored. This molecular cross talk was assessed using an in vitro gut microbiota model and then analyzed by various omics approaches, allowing the identification of genes associated with bacterial cell adaptation/colonization in the human intestine. Our findings provide insights into the manner by which assembly of the early gut microbiota may be regulated by host factors such as hormones carried by human milk.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gestational age (GA) and associated level of gastrointestinal tract maturation are major factors driving the initial gut microbiota composition in preterm infants. Besides, compared to term infants, premature infants often receive antibiotics to treat infections and probiotics to restore optimal gut microbiota. How GA, antibiotics, and probiotics modulate the microbiota's core characteristics, gut resistome and mobilome, remains nascent. METHODS: We analysed metagenomic data from a longitudinal observational study in six Norwegian neonatal intensive care units to describe the bacterial microbiota of infants of varying GA and receiving different treatments. The cohort consisted of probiotic-supplemented and antibiotic-exposed extremely preterm infants (n = 29), antibiotic-exposed very preterm (n = 25), antibiotic-unexposed very preterm (n = 8), and antibiotic-unexposed full-term (n = 10) infants. The stool samples were collected on days of life 7, 28, 120, and 365, and DNA extraction was followed by shotgun metagenome sequencing and bioinformatical analysis. FINDINGS: The top predictors of microbiota maturation were hospitalisation length and GA. Probiotic administration rendered the gut microbiota and resistome of extremely preterm infants more alike to term infants on day 7 and ameliorated GA-driven loss of microbiota interconnectivity and stability. GA, hospitalisation, and both microbiota-modifying treatments (antibiotics and probiotics) contributed to an elevated carriage of mobile genetic elements in preterm infants compared to term controls. Finally, Escherichia coli was associated with the highest number of antibiotic-resistance genes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella aerogenes. INTERPRETATION: Prolonged hospitalisation, antibiotics, and probiotic intervention contribute to dynamic alterations in resistome and mobilome, gut microbiota characteristics relevant to infection risk.

It has also been claimed that this colonization is guided by bacterial populations, the dynamic virome, and transkingdom interactions between host and microbial cells, partially mediated by epigenetic signaling. In this article, we characterized the bacteriome, virome, and smallRNome and their interaction in the meconium and stool samples from infants. Bacterial and viral DNA and RNA were extracted from the meconium and stool samples of 2- to 4-month-old milk-fed infants. The bacteriome, DNA and RNA virome, and smallRNome were assessed using 16S rRNA V4 sequencing, viral enrichment sequencing, and small RNA sequencing protocols, respectively. Data pathway analysis and integration were performed using the R package mixOmics. Our findings showed that the bacteriome differed among the three groups, while the virome and smallRNome presented significant differences, mainly between the meconium and stool of milk-fed infants. The gut environment is rapidly acquired after birth, and it is highly adaptable due to the interaction of environmental factors. Additionally, transkingdom interactions between viruses and bacteria can influence host and smallRNome profiles. However, virome characterization has several protocol limitations that must be considered.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to reassess the effect of prophylactic transcervical amnioinfusion for intrapartum meconium-stained amniotic fluid on meconium aspiration syndrome and other adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. DATA SOURCES: From inception to November 2021, a systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and gray literature sources. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We identified randomized controlled trials of patients with intrapartum moderate to thick meconium-stained amniotic fluid that evaluated the effect of amnioinfusion on adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. METHODS: Of note, 2 reviewers independently abstracted data and gauged study quality by assigning a modified Jadad score. Meconium aspiration syndrome constituted the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were meconium below the cords, Apgar scores of <7 at 5 minutes, neonatal acidosis, cesarean delivery, cesarean delivery for fetal heart rate abnormalities, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and postpartum endometritis. This study calculated the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for categorical outcomes and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 24 randomized studies with 5994 participants met the inclusion criteria. The overall odds of meconium aspiration syndrome was reduced by 67% in the amnioinfusion group (pooled odds ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.51). Except for postpartum endometritis, amnioinfusion was associated with a significant reduction in all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our study found that the use of intrapartum amnioinfusion in the setting of meconium-stained amniotic fluid significantly reduces the odds of meconium aspiration syndrome and other adverse neonatal outcomes.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In many low-income countries, including Ethiopia, neonatal mortality remains a major concern. For every newborn that dies, many more neonates survived (near-miss neonates) the first 28 days after birth from life-threatening conditions. The generation of evidence on neonatal near-miss determinants could be a critical step in reducing neonatal mortality rates. However, studies causal pathway determinants are limited in Ethiopia. This study aimed to investigate the Neonatal Near-miss determinants in public health hospitals in Amhara Regional State, northwest Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1277 mother-newborn pairs at six hospitals between July 2021 and January 2022. A validated interviewer-administered questionnaire and a review of medical records were used to collect data. Data were entered into Epi-Info version 7.1.2 and exported to STATA version 16 in California, America for analysis. The paths from exposure variables to Neonatal Near-Miss via mediators were examined using multiple logistic regression analysis. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and ss-coefficients were calculated and reported with a 95% confidence interval and a p-value of 0.05. RESULTS: The proportion of neonatal near-misses was 28.6% (365/1277) (95% CI: 26-31%). Women who could not read and write (AOR = 1.67,95%CI:1.14-2.47), being primiparous (AOR = 2.48,95% CI:1.63-3.79), pregnancy-induced hypertension (AOR = 2.10,95% CI:1.49-2.95),being referred from other health facilities (AOR = 2.28,95% CI:1.88-3.29), premature rupture of membrane (AOR = 1.47,95% CI:1.09-1.98), and fetal malposition (AOR = 1.89,95% CI:1.14-3.16) were associated with Neonatal Near-miss. Grade III meconium stained amniotic fluid partially mediated the relationship between primiparous (ss = 0.517), fetal malposition (ss = 0.526), pregnant women referred from other health facilities (ss = 0.948) and Neonatal Near-Miss at P-value < 0.01. Duration of the active first stage of labour partially mediated the relationship between primiparous (ss = -0.345), fetal malposition (ss = -0.656), premature rupture of membranes (ss = -0.550) and Neonatal Near-Miss at P- value <0.01.It had also a significant indirect effect (ss = 0.581, P<0.001) on NNM with variables (primiparous, fetal malposition, and premature rupture of membranes). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between fetal malposition, primiparous, referred from other health facilities, premature rupture of membrane, and Neonatal Near miss were partially mediated by grade III meconium stained amniotic fluid and duration of the active first stage of labour.

Mode of delivery, antibiotic prophylaxis, and feeding method have been studied as modulators of mother-to-infant microbiome transmission, but other key influencing factors like modern westernized lifestyles with high hygienization, high-calorie diets, and urban settings, compared with non-westernized lifestyles have not been investigated yet. In this study, we explored the mother-infant sharing of characterized and uncharacterized microbiome members via strain-resolved metagenomics in a cohort of Ethiopian mothers and infants, and we compared them with four other cohorts with different lifestyles. The westernized and non-westernized newborns' microbiomes composition overlapped during the first months of life more than later in life, likely reflecting similar initial breast-milk-based diets. Ethiopian and other non-westernized infants shared a smaller fraction of the microbiome with their mothers than did most westernized populations, despite showing a higher microbiome diversity, and uncharacterized species represented a substantial fraction of those shared in the Ethiopian cohort. Moreover, we identified uncharacterized species belonging to the Selenomonadaceae and Prevotellaceae families specifically present and shared only in the Ethiopian cohort, and we showed that a locally produced fermented food, injera, can contribute to the higher diversity observed in the Ethiopian infants' gut with bacteria that are not part of the human microbiome but are acquired through fermented food consumption. Taken together, these findings highlight the fact that lifestyle can impact the gut microbiome composition not only through differences in diet, drug consumption, and environmental factors but also through its effect on mother-infant strain-sharing patterns.",

Because of their systemic immaturity, including an underdeveloped immune system, preterm infants are susceptible to a range of infections. Numerous retrospective studies have examined the association of the preterm gut microbiota with diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis. To date, no single bacterium has been associated with infection in these infants, but a Klebsiella/Enterococcus-dominated faecal microbiota is associated with an increased risk of developing NEC. Staphylococci aid and enterococci inhibit establishment/maintenance of gastrointestinal Klebsiella populations in preterm infants, though the mechanisms underlying these interactions are poorly understood. Klebsiella spp. recovered from healthy and sick preterm infants display similar antimicrobial resistance and virulence profiles, giving no clues as to why some infants develop potentially life-threatening diseases while others do not. The identification of cytotoxin-producing Klebsiella oxytoca sensu lato in the gut microbiota of some preterm infants has led to the suggestion that these bacteria may contribute to NEC in a subset of neonates.

			"abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a vital role in health and disease. In particular, the first days of life provide a unique window of opportunity for development and establishment of microbial community. Currently, stool samples are known to be the most widely used sampling approach for studying the gut microbiome. However, complicated sample acquisition at certain time points, challenges in transportation, and patient discomfort underline the need for development of alternative sampling approaches. One of the alternatives is rectal swabs, shown to be a reliable proxy for gut microbiome analysis when obtained from adults. Here, we compare the usability of rectal swabs and meconium paired samples collected from infants on the first days of life. Our results indicate that the two sampling approaches display significantly distinct patterns in microbial composition and alpha and beta diversity as well as detection of resistance genes. Moreover, the dissimilarity between the two collection methods was greater than the interindividual variation. Therefore, we conclude that rectal swabs are not a reliable proxy compared to stool samples for gut microbiome analysis when collected on the first days of a newborn's life. IMPORTANCE Currently, there are numerous suggestions on how to ease the notoriously complex and error-prone methodological setups to study the gut microbiota of newborns during the first days of life. Especially, meconium samples are regularly failing to yield meaningful data output and therefore have been suggested to be replaced by rectal swabs as done in adults as well. We find this development toward a simplified method to be producing dramatically erroneous results, skewing data interpretation away from the real aspects to be considered for neonatal health during the first days of life. We have put together our knowledge on this critical aspect with careful consideration and identified the failure of rectal swabs to be a replacement for sampling of meconium in term-born newborns.",

Stools from cases and controls were tested for enteropathogens, including norovirus and rotavirus, by TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional reverse transcription PCR. We used multiple logistic regression to derive adjusted attributable fractions (AFe) for each pathogen causing MSD, which takes into consideration the prevalence in both cases and controls, for each site and age. A pathogen was considered etiologic if AFe was >/=0.5. In further analyses focusing on the predominant NVII strains, we compared rotavirus and NVII severity using a 20-point modified Vesikari score and examined seasonal fluctuations. RESULTS: From May 2015 to July 2018, we enrolled 4840 MSD cases and 6213 controls. NVI was attributed to only 1 MSD episode. NVII was attributed to 185 (3.8%) of all MSD episodes and was the sole attributable pathogen in 139 (2.9%); peaking (36.0%) at age 6-8 months with majority (61.2%) aged 6-11 months. MSD cases whose episodes were attributed to NVII alone compared with rotavirus alone were younger (median age, 8 vs 12 months, P < .0001) and had less severe illness (median Vesikari severity score, 9 vs 11, P = .0003) but equally likely to be dehydrated. NVII occurred year-round at all study sites. CONCLUSIONS: Infants aged 6-11 months bear the greatest burden of norovirus disease, with NVII predominating. An early infant vaccine schedule and rigorous adherence to guidelines recommended for management of dehydrating diarrhea may offer substantial benefit in these African settings.",

Perturbed microbial colonization during critical early-life windows of development alters metabolic and immune programming and is associated with an increased risk of immune and metabolic diseases. In nonrandomized studies, vaginal seeding of C-section-born neonates partially restores their microbiota colonization to that of their vaginally delivered counterparts, but without randomization, confounding factors cannot be excluded. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we determined the effect of vaginal seeding versus placebo seeding (control arm) on the skin and stool microbiota of elective, prelabor C-section-born neonates (n = 20) at 1 day and 1 month after birth. We also examined whether there were between-arm differences in engraftment of maternal microbes in the neonatal microbiota. In relation to the control arm, vaginal seeding increased mother-to-neonate microbiota transmission and caused compositional changes and a reduction in alpha diversity (Shannon Index) of the skin and stool microbiota. The neonatal skin and stool microbiota alpha diversity when maternal vaginal microbiota is provided is intriguing and highlights the need of larger randomized studies to determine the ecological mechanisms and effects of vaginal seeding on clinical outcomes.

			"abstract": "Birth mode has been implicated as a major factor influencing neonatal gut microbiome development, and it has been assumed that lack of exposure to the maternal vaginal microbiome is responsible for gut dysbiosis among caesarean-delivered infants. Consequently, practices to correct dysbiotic gut microbiomes, such as vaginal seeding, have arisen while the effect of the maternal vaginal microbiome on that of the infant gut remains unknown. We conducted a longitudinal, prospective cohort study of 621 Canadian pregnant women and their newborn infants and collected pre-delivery maternal vaginal swabs and infant stool samples at 10-days and 3-months of life. Using cpn60-based amplicon sequencing, we defined vaginal and stool microbiome profiles and evaluated the effect of maternal vaginal microbiome composition and various clinical variables on the development of the infant stool microbiome. Infant stool microbiomes showed significant differences in composition by delivery mode at 10-days postpartum; however, this effect could not be explained by maternal vaginal microbiome composition and was vastly reduced by 3 months. Vaginal microbiome clusters were distributed across infant stool clusters in proportion to their frequency in the overall maternal population, indicating independence of the two communities. Intrapartum antibiotic administration was identified as a confounder of infant stool microbiome differences and was associated with lower abundances of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum and Parabacteroides distasonis. Our findings demonstrate that maternal vaginal microbiome composition at delivery does not affect infant stool microbiome composition and development, suggesting that practices to amend infant stool microbiome composition focus factors other than maternal vaginal microbes.",

Gut microbiome-related studies mostly focus on the relationship between bacteria and neonatal diarrhea onset, and no research study has investigated the role of the gut virome in neonatal diarrhea. Here, using metagenomic sequencing, we characterized the fecal viral community of diarrheal and healthy neonatal piglets. We found that the viral community of diarrheal piglets showed higher individual heterogeneity and elevated abundance of Myoviridae. By predicting the bacterial host of the identified viral genomes, phages infecting Proteobacteria, especially E. coli, were the dominant taxa in neonatal diarrheal piglets. Consistent with this, the antibiotic resistance gene of E. coli origin was also enriched in neonatal diarrheal piglets. Finally, we established a random forest model to accurately discriminate between neonatal diarrheal piglets and healthy controls and identified genus E. coli- and genus listeria-infecting bacteriophages, including psa and C5 viruses, as key biomarkers. In conclusion, we provide the first glance of viral community and function characteristics in diarrheal and healthy neonatal piglets. These findings expand our understanding of the relationship among phages, bacteria and diarrhea, and may facilitate the development of therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of neonatal diarrhea.",

			"article_name": "Meconium-stained amniotic fluid.",
			"abstract": "Green-stained amniotic fluid, often referred to as meconium-stained amniotic fluid, is present in 5% to 20% of patients in labor and is considered an obstetric hazard. The condition has been attributed to the passage of fetal colonic content (meconium), intraamniotic bleeding with the presence of heme catabolic products, or both. The frequency of green-stained amniotic fluid increases as a function of gestational age, reaching approximately 27% in post-term gestation. Green-stained amniotic fluid during labor has been associated with fetal acidemia (umbilical artery pH <7.00), neonatal respiratory distress, and seizures as well as cerebral palsy. Hypoxia is widely considered a mechanism responsible for fetal defecation and meconium-stained amniotic fluid; however, most fetuses with meconium-stained amniotic fluid do not have fetal acidemia. Intraamniotic infection/inflammation has emerged as an important factor in meconium-stained amniotic fluid in term and preterm gestations, as patients with these conditions have a higher rate of clinical chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis. The precise mechanisms linking intraamniotic inflammation to green-stained amniotic fluid have not been determined, but the effects of oxidative stress in heme catabolism have been implicated. Two randomized clinical trials suggest that antibiotic administration decreases the rate of clinical chorioamnionitis in patients with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. A serious complication of meconium-stained amniotic fluid is meconium aspiration syndrome. This condition develops in 5% of cases presenting with meconium-stained amniotic fluid and is a severe complication typical of term newborns. Meconium aspiration syndrome is attributed to the mechanical and chemical effects of aspirated meconium coupled with local and systemic fetal inflammation. Routine naso/oropharyngeal suctioning and tracheal intubation in cases of meconium-stained amniotic fluid have not been shown to be beneficial and are no longer recommended in obstetrical practice. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials suggested that amnioinfusion may decrease the rate of meconium aspiration syndrome. Histologic examination of the fetal membranes for meconium has been invoked in medical legal litigation to time the occurrence of fetal injury. However, inferences have been largely based on the results of in vitro experiments, and extrapolation of such findings to the clinical setting warrants caution. Fetal defecation throughout gestation appears to be a physiologic phenomenon based on ultrasound as well as in observations in animals.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caesarean section (CS) is associated with newborns' health risks due to the blocking of microbiome transfer. The gut microbiota of CS-born babies was different from those born vaginally, which may be attributed to reduced exposure to maternal vaginal microbes during labour. To understand the microbial transfer and reduce CS disadvantages, the effect of vaginal microbiota exposure on infant gut microbiota composition was evaluated using 16s rDNA sequencing-based techniques. RESULTS: Pregnant women were recruited in the Women and Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University from June 1(st) to August 15(th), 2017. Maternal faeces (n = 26), maternal vaginal fluids (n = 26), and neonatal transitional stools (n = 26) were collected, while the participants underwent natural delivery (ND) (n = 6), CS (n = 4) and CS with the intervention of vaginal seedings (I) (n = 16). 26 mothers with the median age 26.50 (25.00-27.25) years showed no substantial clinical differences. The newborns' gut microbiota altered among ND, CS and I, and clustered into two groups (PERMANOVA P = 0.001). Microbial composition of ND babies shared more features with maternal vaginal samples (PERMANOVA P = 0.065), while the microbiota structure of ND babies was obviously different from that of sample of maternal faeces. The genus Bacteroides in CS-born babies with intervention approached to vaginal-born neonates, compared with CS-born neonates without intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal gut microbiota was dependent on the delivery mode. And the gut microbiota CS newborns with vaginal seeding shared more features with those of ND babies, which hinted the aberrant gut microbiota composition initiated by CS might be partly mitigated by maternal vaginal microbiota exposure.",

We investigated whether alcohol biomarkers fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in meconium are predicted by maternal or newborn demographics and/or correlate with confidential early postnatal self-report of alcohol consumption in pregnancy. DESIGN: Anonymised, observational population-based study. SETTING: Inner-city maternity unit, Glasgow, UK. PATIENTS: Singleton mother/infant dyads delivering every fourth day. INTERVENTIONS: Mother: confidential postnatal interview. Baby: meconium sample for FAEEs and EtG. RESULTS: 840/908 mothers consented. 370 (46.4%) reported alcohol consumption in pregnancy, generally of modest amount; for 114 (13.6%) this was after 20 weeks' gestation. Alcohol consumption in later pregnancy was more commonly reported by older (31.3 vs 29.5 years) women of white British ethnicity (p<0.05); their babies were on average 118 g heavier (p=0.032). FAEEs were identified in all meconium samples; concentration was >/=600 ng/g in 39.6%. EtG concentration was >/=30 ng/g in 14.5%. Neither biomarker was associated with maternal age, body mass index or socioeconomic status but when EtG was >/=30 ng/g, the mother was less likely to identify as white British (71.3% vs 81.8%, p=0.028). Sensitivities of FAEEs >/=600 ng/g and EtG >/=30 ng/g were 43.1% and 11.6%, respectively for postnatal self-report of alcohol use in later pregnancy (specificities 60.6% and 84.8%). CONCLUSIONS: FAEEs and EtG measured in meconium have low sensitivity and specificity for self-reported alcohol consumption after 20 weeks' gestation in an unselected Scottish population.",

Fecal samples were collected, and fecal microbiota, stool pH, short-chain fatty acids, and immune substances were analyzed. Supplementation with B. infantis M-63 significantly increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium compared with the placebo group, with a positive correlation with the frequency of breastfeeding. Supplementation with B. infantis M-63 led to decreased stool pH and increased levels of acetic acid and IgA in the stool at 1 month of age compared with the placebo group. There was a decreased frequency of defecation and watery stools in the probiotic group. No adverse events related to test foods were observed. These results indicate that early supplementation with B. infantis M-63 is well tolerated and contributes to the development of Bifidobacterium-predominant gut microbiota during a critical developmental phase in term infants.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The gut virome of humans is mainly composed of bacteriophages and their role in shaping the gut microbiome and influencing human health is increasingly recognized. However, little is known about the dynamic changes of the gut virome in children and its role in growth and development. In this study, we collected fecal samples from newborns and children under 5 years old from the same area during the same time period to investigate the gut viral community using viral metagenomic technique. METHODS: We used viral metagenomics to compare the gut bacteriophage composition between newborns and children under 5 years of age. We collected fecal samples from 45 newborns who were born at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University and 45 healthy children who were examined at the same hospital. The two groups were classified as the newborn group and the children group. RESULTS: Our sequencing analysis showed that the number of seqeunce reads of the children group were more than that of the newborn group. The results of alpha diversity and beta diversity both indicated that the diversity of the children group was significantly higher than that of the newborn group and the children group is different from the newborn group. The abundance of gut virome in the children group was also higher than that in the newborn group. The analysis of the genetic characteristics of the viruses showed that the phage genome was scattered and clustered with specificity. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the gut bacteriophage communities undergo changes over time, presenting diversity and dynamic characteristics. We characterized the composition of gut virome in children and newborns in this region. However, further research is needed to investigate the function of bacteriophages in the ecology of the gastrointestinal tract.",

We collected fecal samples from five newborns with NEC and five gestational age-matched premature neonates without NEC at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford and Washington University School of Medicine, respectively. Fecal K8 levels were measured using a modified ELISA protocol and Western blot, and fecal calprotectin was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. Clinical data, including gestational age, birth weight, Bell stage for NEC, feeding strategies, total white blood cell (WBC) count, and other pertinent clinical variables, were collected and analyzed. Fecal K8 levels were significantly higher in the pre-NEC group (1-2 days before diagnosis of NEC) and NEC group than those in the non-NEC group (p = 0.013, p = 0.041). Moreover, fecal K8 was relatively higher at the onset of NEC and declined after the resolution of the disease (p = 0.019). Results with similar trends to fecal K8 were also seen in fecal calprotectin (p = 0.046), but not seen in total WBC count (p = 0.182). In conclusion, a modified ELISA protocol for the total K8 protein was successfully developed for the detection of fecal K8 in the clinical setting of premature newborns with NEC. Fecal K8 is noted to be significantly increased in premature newborns with NEC and may, therefore, serve as a noninvasive and specific marker for intestinal epithelial injury associated with NEC.",

We collected samples from vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid in pregnant women and umbilical cord blood, gastric liquid, and meconium from neonates. We identified 19,597,239 bacterial sequences from 641 samples of 141 pregnant women and 178 neonates. By applying rigorous filtering criteria to remove contaminants, we found evidence of microbial colonization in traditionally considered sterile intrauterine environments and the fetal gastrointestinal track. The microbiome distribution was strongly grouped by sample collection site, rather than the mother-neonate pairs. The distinct bacterial composition in meconium, the first stool passed by newborns, supports that microbial colonization occurs during normal pregnancy. The microbiome in neonatal gastric liquid was similar, but not identical, to that in maternal amnionic fluid, as expected since fetuses swallow amnionic fluid in utero and their urine returns to the fluid under normal physiological conditions. Establishing a microbiome library from various samples formed only during pregnancy is crucial for understanding human development and identifying microbiome modifications in obstetrical complications.",

Up to half of all extremely preterm neonates struggle to grow despite modern nutrition practices. Although elegant preclinical models suggest causal roles for the gut microbiome, these insights have not yet translated into biomarkers that identify at-risk neonates or therapies that prevent or treat growth failure. This systematic review aims to identify features of the neonatal gut microbiota that are positively or negatively associated with early postnatal growth. We identified 860 articles, of which 14 were eligible for inclusion. No two studies used the same definitions of growth, ages at stool collection, and statistical methods linking microbiota to metadata. In all, 58 different taxa were associated with growth, with little consensus among studies. Two or more studies reported positive associations with Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Veillonella, and negative associations with Citrobacter, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus. Streptococcus was positively associated with growth in five studies and negatively associated with growth in three studies. To gain insight into how the various definitions of growth could impact results, we performed an exploratory secondary analysis of 245 longitudinally sampled preterm infant stools, linking microbiota composition to multiple clinically relevant definitions of neonatal growth. Within this cohort, every definition of growth was associated with a different combination of microbiota features. Together, these results suggest that the lack of consensus in defining neonatal growth may limit our capacity to detect consistent, meaningful clinical associations that could be leveraged into improved care for preterm neonates.",

To functionally analyse the principles of three successful preventive NEC regimens, we characterize fecal samples of 55 infants (<1500 g, n = 383, female = 22) longitudinally (two weeks) with respect to gut microbiome profiles (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses; targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics), microbial function, virulence factors, antibiotic resistances and metabolic profiles, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and short-chain fatty acids (German Registry of Clinical Trials, No.: DRKS00009290). Regimens including probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis NCDO 2203 supplementation affect microbiome development globally, pointing toward the genomic potential to convert HMOs.

Crucially, the beneficial effects of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis NCDO 2203 supplementation depends on simultaneous feeding with HMOs.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since a high incidence of mortality and morbidity is induced by preterm birth, it is important to understand how hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in preterm infants alters gut microbiota development. METHODS: We analyzed 89 stools from 30 term newborns (NNG), 30 preterm infants without apnea (PG) and 29 preterm infants with definite diagnosis of apnea (PAG) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in this study. RESULTS: The data showed that species richness and diversity in PG and PAG were significantly lower compared with NNG. This study investigated the difference in bacteria and relative abundance between NNG, PG and PAG. The abundance of Klebsiella and Streptococcus strains were markedly increased, while Clostridium was significantly decreased in PAG compared with PG. The most notable exceptions included Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, which were markedly increased in PG and PAG, and these provide the main bacterial source of dopamine and serotonin production. This study also revealed that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were markedly increased in PG and PAG, and these are the main source of GABA production for bacteria. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed that apnea had a uniform effect on species richness and diversity. However, it cannot be established whether the abundance and difference of these bacterial genera and species directly affect the occurrence and development of preterm infants with HIE by secreting intestinal neurotransmitters.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Neonatal Life Support 2020 guidelines emphasize that meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) remains a significant risk factor for a newborn to receive advanced resuscitation, especially if additional risk factors are present at the time of birth. However, these additional perinatal risk factors are not clearly identified. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of additional independent ante- and intrapartum risk factors in the era of no routine endotracheal suctioning that determine the need for resuscitation in newborns born through MSAF. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included deliveries >/= 35 weeks' gestation associated with MSAF that occurred between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019. The newborns needing resuscitation (any intervention beyond the initial steps) were compared to those not needing resuscitation. Among newborns needing resuscitation, those needing advanced resuscitation (continuous positive airway pressure/ positive pressure ventilation or beyond) were compared to those not needing advanced resuscitation. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed that among various perinatal factors, primigravida, thick meconium, fetal distress, chorioamnionitis, rupture of membranes >/= 18 hours, post-term (gestational age >/= 42 weeks), cesarean section or shoulder dystocia independently significantly increased the odds of a meconium-stained newborn needing resuscitation. Among these factors, fetal distress, chorioamnionitis or cesarean section independently further increased the odds of needing advanced resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Risk stratification of perinatal factors associated with the need for newborn resuscitation and advanced resuscitation in the deliveries associated with MSAF may help neonatal teams and resources to be appropriately prioritized and optimally utilized.",

			"abstract": "Exclusive breastfeeding is highly recommended for infants for at least the first six months of life. However, for some mothers, it may be difficult or even impossible to do so. This can lead to disturbances in the gut microbiota, which in turn may be related to a higher incidence of acute infectious diseases. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether a novel starting formula versus a standard formula provides a gut microbiota composition more similar to that of breastfed infants in the first 6 months of life. Two hundred and ten infants (70/group) were enrolled in the study and completed the intervention until 12 months of age. For the intervention period, infants were divided into three groups: Group 1 received formula 1 (INN) with a lower amount of protein, a proportion of casein to whey protein ratio of about 70/30 by increasing the content of alpha-lactalbumin, and with double the amount of docosahexaenoic acid/arachidonic acid than the standard formula; INN also contained a thermally inactivated postbiotic (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). Group 2 received the standard formula (STD) and the third group was exclusively breastfed (BF) for exploratory analysis. During the study, visits were made at 21 days, 2, 4, and 6 months of age, with +/-3 days for the visit at 21 days of age, +/-1 week for the visit at 2 months, and +/-2 weeks for the others. Here, we reveal how consuming the INN formula promotes a similar gut microbiota composition to those infants that were breastfed in terms of richness and diversity, genera, such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus, and calprotectin and short-chain fatty acid levels at 21 days, 2 and 6 months. Furthermore, we observed that the major bacteria metabolic pathways were more alike between the INN formula and BF groups compared to the STD formula group. Therefore, we assume that consumption of the novel INN formula might improve gut microbiota composition, promoting a healthier intestinal microbiota more similar to that of an infant who receives exclusively human milk.",

Here, we report our development of a new gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of P[6] HRV infection and disease as a tool for evaluating potential vaccine candidates. The Arg HRV (G4P[6]) strain was derived from a diarrheic human infant stool sample and determined to be free of other viruses by metagenomic sequencing. Neonatal Gn pigs were orally inoculated with the stool suspension containing 5.6 x 10(5) fluorescent focus units (FFU) of the virus. Small and large intestinal contents were collected at post inoculation day 2 or 3. The virus was passaged 6 times in neonatal Gn pigs to generate a large inoculum pool. Next, 33-34 day old Gn pigs were orally inoculated with 10(-2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) FFU of Arg HRV to determine the optimal challenge dose. All pigs developed clinical signs of infection, regardless of the inoculum dose. The optimal challenge dose was determined to be 10(5) FFU. This new Gn pig model is ready to be used to assess the protective efficacy of candidate monovalent and multivalent vaccines against P[6] HRV.",

This study aimed to compare the effects of breast milk microbiota on the construction and colonization of gut microbiota in newborns. In this study, 23 healthy infants were selected and divided into a breastfeeding group (13) and a mixed feeding group (10) based on the feeding method within one month of age. Infant fecal and breast milk samples were collected on the day of birth (0 day) and 30 days after birth (30 days) for 16S rRNA second-generation sequencing and SCFA detection. The results showed that Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota on day 0 and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on 30 d dominated breast milk gut microbiota. There were correlations between the breast milk microbiota and the infant gut microbiota in each group (p < 0.05). Additionally, breast milk microbiota correlated more significantly with infants' SCFAs in the breastfeeding group than in the mixed feeding group. This study showed that breast milk microbiota partially influences the construction of infant gut microbiota, with some key strains having a crucial influence, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterobacter. However, the effect of breast milk microbiota on infant gut microbiota is not through direct strain transmission but has been indirectly influenced, which may be related to the cross-feeding effect mediated by SCFAs.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several common maternal or neonatal risk factors have been linked to meconium amniotic fluid (MAF) development; however, the results are contradictory, depending on the study. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of MAF in singleton pregnancies. METHODS: This study is a retrospective cohort that assessed singleton pregnant mothers who gave birth at a tertiary hospital in Bandar Abbas, Iran, between January 1st, 2020, and January 1st, 2022. Mothers were divided into two groups: 1) those diagnosed with meconium amniotic fluid (MAF) and 2) those diagnosed with clear amniotic fluid. Mothers with bloody amniotic fluid were excluded. Demographic factors, obstetrical factors, and maternal comorbidities were extracted from the electronic data of each mother. The Chi-square test was used to compare differences between the groups for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were used to assess meconium amniotic fluid risk factors. RESULTS: Of 8888 singleton deliveries during the study period, 1085 (12.2%) were MAF. MAF was more common in adolescents, mothers with postterm pregnancy, and primiparous mothers, and it was less common in mothers with GDM and overt diabetes. The odds of having MAF in adolescents were three times higher than those in mothers 20-34 years old (aOR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.87-4.98). Likewise, there were significantly increased odds of MAF in mothers with late-term pregnancy (aOR: 5.12, 95% CI: 2.76-8.94), and mothers with post-term pregnancy (aOR: 7.09, 95% CI: 3.92-9.80). Primiparous women were also more likely than multiparous mothers to have MAF (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 2.11-4.99). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents, primiparous mothers, and mothers with post-term pregnancies had a higher risk of MAF. Maternal comorbidities resulting in early termination of pregnancy can reduce the incidence of MAF.",

However, limited information has been developed on associations with birth outcomes of fetal exposure to metal mixtures using the meconium as a biomarker. The purpose of this study was to evaluate relationships of the combined effects of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) concentrations in the meconium on birth outcomes (i.e., birth weight, birth length, and head circumference). This cross-sectional study was conducted in northern Taiwan between January 2007 and December 2009. We collected 526 meconium samples within the first 24 h after birth to measure the in utero mixed-metal exposure determined using inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We used a multivariable regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to estimate associations of the combined effects and identify important mixture components with growth impairments. Our results revealed Hg, Pb, Cd, and As concentrations in the meconium and enhanced the quantity of research on meconium analyses. The overall effects of Hg, Pb, Cd, and As concentrations in the meconium as prenatal exposure biomarkers were negatively associated with birth growth. Fetal exposure to Hg and Pb was correlated with decreased birth weights. Hg and Pb concentrations in the meconium were linearly inversely related to the birth weight, birth length, and head circumference. Effects of fetal exposure to As and Cd on birth outcomes were not obvious. A significant increasing relationship was detected between Hg concentrations in the meconium and maternal fish consumption during pregnancy. Higher Pb concentrations in the meconium were observed among infants of mothers who consumed Chinese herbal medicines. Reducing maternal fish consumption and Chinese herbal medicine consumption during pregnancy could limit infant exposure to metals.",

			"abstract": "Illicit drug use during pregnancy is a concern worldwide, with many international studies describing attempted strategies to mitigate this problem. Drug misuse during pregnancy is associated with significant maternal as well as perinatal complications, which include a high incidence of stillbirths, fetal distress, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and increased neonatal mortality. Unfortunately, the identification of a drug-exposed mother or neonate is challenging. Maternal disclosure of drug use is often inaccurate, principally due to psychosocial factors including behavioral denial or the fear of the consequences resulting from such admissions. Likewise, many infants who have been exposed to drugs in utero may appear normal at birth and initially show no overt manifestations of drug effects. Thus, the identification of the drug-exposed infant requires a high index of clinical suspicion. Conversely, analytical testing is an objective means of determining drug exposure when it may be necessary to document proof of the infant's exposure to illicit drugs. The review will discuss the different matrices that are most commonly used for testing (e.g., maternal urine, neonatal urine, meconium, and umbilical cord), the strengths and limitations for each matrix, which drugs and metabolites are appropriate for testing, the various testing methods, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method.",

			"abstract": "The human gut ecosystem starts developing at birth and is influenced by many factors during early life. In this study we make use of a Belgian cohort of 64 children, followed until the age of 6 years, to analyze different phases of microbiota development. We analyzed fecal samples taken before weaning (age 1 month), shortly after weaning (age 6 months), when milk feeding has been discontinued completely (age 1 year), and at the age of 6 years. We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on the collected fecal samples and analyzed the compositional data in relation to dietary metadata and birth mode. Human and formula milk feeding promotes a microbiota dominated by either Bacteroides or Bifidobacterium, respectively. Into later life stages, the microbiota composition follows distinct microbiota clusters, related to abundance dynamics of certain bacterial groups. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that a formula diet leads to early maturation of the infant gut microbiota. Despite other clinical variables within the infant cohort, they did not significantly contribute to the microbiota patterns we observed. Our data provide a proof of principle study of the importance of diet to the development of the microbiota in early life that replicates earlier findings in other cohorts.",

Therefore, we explored MP exposure in placentas and meconium samples, and the potential correlation of MP exposure with microbiota in placentas and meconium. A total of 18 mother-infant pairs were effectively recruited from Shanghai, China. The study required pregnant women to provide placentas and meconium samples. An Agilent 8700 laser infrared imaging spectrometer (LDIR) was applied to identify MPs. Microbiota detection was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Sixteen types of MPs were found in all matrices, and polyamide (PA) and polyurethane (PU) were the major types we identified. MPs detected in samples with a size of 20-50 mum were more than 76.46%. At the phylum level, both placenta and meconium microbiota were mainly composed of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes. We also found some significant differences between placenta and meconium microbiota in beta-diversity and gut composition. Additionally, we found polystyrene was inversely related with the Chao index of meconium microbiota. Polyethylene was consistently inversely correlated with several genera of placenta microbiota. The total MPs, PA, and PU consistently impacted several genera of meconium microbiota. In conclusion, MPs are ubiquitous in placentas and meconium samples, indicating the wide exposure of pregnant women and infants. Moreover, our findings may support a link between high concentration of MPs and microbiota genera in placentas and meconium.

			"abstract": "Gut microbiota transmission from mother to offspring is critical to infant gut microbiota and immune development. Mother's intestine and breast milk are rich in secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), which can coat a specific bacterial spectrum and may be related to bacterial transmission and colonization. Here we analyzed the microbiota and sIgA-coated bacteria of maternal fecal samples and breast milk and infant fecal samples from 19 dyads by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. For the sIgA-coated microbiota, both the phylogenetic diversity and the Shannon index of maternal fecal samples show a lower trend than those of infant fecal samples (P < 0.05). For beta diversity, all three samples were significantly different from each other (P < 0.05, based on permutational multivariate analysis of variance). We found that sIgA mediated a wide range of vertical transmission of trace bacteria with a relative abundance of amplicon sequence variants of more than 0.0001%. FEAST-based analysis reveals that there was an equal contribution of the maternal gut (median [IQR]; 8.75% [0.90, 62.14]) and breast milk (9.23% [1.69, 22.29]) to infant intestinal total microbiota. The 39 percent of sIgA-coated microbiota in breast milk samples provided as much as 28.49-93.84 percent of all sIgA-coated microbiota in the newborn gut. Therefore, maternal gut and breast milk sIgA-coated bacteria are essential sources of intestinal bacteria in infants. There was high individual variation in the contribution of the maternal gut and breast milk microbiota to the paired infant gut microbiota. Analysis based on the weighted transfer ratio (WTR) explained that diverse sIgA-coated bacteria are transferred from breast milk to the gut of the respective infant, mainly lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus gasseri (WTR = 2475.5), Enterococcus faecium (WTR = 2438) and Streptococcus salivarius (WTR = 117.71). Bifidobacterium longum, with a WTR of 69.35, is the key sIgA-coated bacteria that are transferred from the mother's gut to breast milk. In conclusion, sIgA mediates the vertical transmission of specific bacteria, to realize the controllable inheritance of the intestinal bacteria and function from the mother to the offspring. This provides a new basis for the screening of probiotics for infant formula addition.",

			"abstract": "Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) can identify affected but asymptomatic infants. The selection of omic technique for gut microbiota study is crucial due to both the small amount of feces available and the low microorganism load. Our aims were to compare the agreement between 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metaproteomics by a robust statistical analysis, including both presence and abundance of taxa, to describe the sequential establishment of the gut microbiota during the first year of life in a small size sample (8 infants and 28 fecal samples). The taxonomic assignations by the two techniques were similar, whereas certain discrepancies were observed in the abundance detection, mostly the lower predicted relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and the higher predicted relative abundance of certain Firmicutes and Proteobacteria by amplicon sequencing. During the first months of life, the CF gut microbiota is characterized by a significant enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus, the expression of certain virulent bacterial traits, and the detection of human inflammation-related proteins. Metaproteomics provides information on composition and functionality, as well as data on host-microbiome interactions. Its strength is the identification and quantification of Actinobacteria and certain classes of Firmicutes, but alpha diversity indices are not comparable to those of amplicon sequencing. Both techniques detected an aberrant microbiota in our small cohort of infants with CF during their first year of life, dominated by the enrichment of R. gnavus within a human inflammatory environment. IMPORTANCE In recent years, some techniques have been incorporated for the study of microbial ecosystems, being 16S rRNA gene sequencing being the most widely used. Metaproteomics provides the advantage of identifying the interaction between microorganisms and human cells, but the available databases are less extensive as well as imprecise. Few studies compare the statistical differences between the two techniques to define the composition of an ecosystem. Our work shows that the two methods are comparable in terms of microorganism identification but provide different results in alpha diversity analysis. On the other hand, we have studied newborns with cystic fibrosis, for whom we have described the establishment of an intestinal ecosystem marked by the inflammatory response of the host and the enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus.",

The aim of this prebirth cohort study was to investigate the association between the maternal gut microbiota in pregnancy and the composition of the infant's cord and peripheral blood immune cells over the first year of life. METHODS: The Barwon Infant Study cohort (n=1074 infants) was recruited using an unselected sampling frame. Maternal fecal samples were collected at 36 weeks of pregnancy and flow cytometry was conducted on cord/peripheral blood collected at birth, 6 and 12 months of age. Among a randomly selected sub-cohort with available samples (n=293), maternal gut microbiota was characterized by sequencing the 16S rRNA V4 region. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered based on their abundance. Associations between maternal fecal microbiota clusters and infant granulocyte, monocyte and lymphocyte subsets were explored using compositional data analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) and regression models were used to investigate the relationships/associations between environmental, maternal and infant factors, and OTU clusters. RESULTS: We identified six clusters of co-occurring OTUs. The first two components in the PLS regression explained 39% and 33% of the covariance between the maternal prenatal OTU clusters and immune cell populations in offspring at birth. A cluster in which Dialister, Escherichia, and Ruminococcus were predominant was associated with a lower proportion of granulocytes (p=0.002), and higher proportions of both central naive CD4(+) T cells (CD4(+)/CD45RA(+)/CD31(-)) (p<0.001) and naive regulatory T cells (Treg) (CD4(+)/CD45RA(+)/FoxP3(low)) (p=0.02) in cord blood. The association with central naive CD4(+) T cells persisted to 12 months of age. CONCLUSION: This birth cohort study provides evidence consistent with past preclinical models that the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy plays a role in shaping the composition of innate and adaptive elements of the infant's immune system following birth.",

The base case analysis showed that the stool color card strategy was $14 927 337 higher than no screening with an increase in 44 more event-free life-years gained, resulting in an ICER of $339 258 per event-free life-year gained. The DB screening strategy compared with stool color card was $138 994 060 higher with an increase in 271 more event-free life-years gained and an ICER of $512 893 per event-free life-year gained. The DB screening strategy compared with no screening resulted in an ICER of $488 639 per event-free life-year gained. The DB screening resulted in 16 fewer liver transplants than stool color card and stool color card had 2 fewer liver transplants than no screening. CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening for biliary atresia could be cost-effective depending on the willingness to pay thresholds for health benefits.",

They have been found almost everywhere they have been searched for and recent discoveries have also demonstrated their presence in human placenta, blood, meconium, and breastmilk, but their location and toxicity to humans have not been reported to date. The aim of this study was twofold: 1. To locate MPs within the intra/extracellular compartment in human placenta. 2. To understand whether their presence and location are associated with possible structural changes of cell organelles. Using variable pressure scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, MPs have been localized in ten human placentas. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the presence and localization in the cellular compartment of fragments compatible with MPs in the human placenta and we hypothesized a possible correlation between their presence and important ultrastructural alterations of some intracytoplasmic organelles (mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum). These alterations have never been reported in normal healthy term pregnancies until today. They could be the result of a prolonged attempt to remove and destroy the plastic particles inside the placental tissue. The presence of virtually indestructible particles in term human placenta could contribute to the activation of pathological traits, such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, characteristic of metabolic disorders underlying obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome and partially accounting for the recent epidemic of non-communicable diseases.",

Sixteen types of MPs were identified, and polyamide (PA) and polyurethane (PU) were dominant. >74 % of the MPs found were 20-50 mum in size. The water intake and usage of scrub cleanser or toothpaste may be exposure sources of pregnant women. The breastfeeding and usage of feeding bottles and plastic toys may be exposure sources for infants.

It is a major concern that such saponifiable BAs are routinely omitted from fecal BA measurements. We compared the BA profiles of healthy stools that were obtained with/without alkaline hydrolysis and found that as much as 29.7% (2.1-67.7%) of total BAs were saponifiable. Specifically, alkaline treatment led to significant elevations of isodeoxycholic acid (isoDCA) and isolithocholic acid (isoLCA) concentrations, suggesting that considerable proportions of isoDCA and isoLCA were esterified. Precursor ion scan data from LC/MS suggested the presence of long-chain FA-linked BAs. We chemically synthesized a series of fatty acid 3beta-acyl conjugates of isoDCA and isoLCA as analytical standards and analyzed their fecal profiles from newborns to adults (n = 64) by LC/MS. FA-conjugated isobile acids (FA-isoBAs) were constantly present from 2 years of age to adulthood. C16- and C18-chain FA-isoBA esters were predominantly found regardless of age, but small amounts of acetic acid esters were also found. FA-isoBA concentrations were not correlated to fecal FA concentrations. Interestingly, there were some adults who did not have FA-isoBAs. Gut bacteria involved in the production of FA-isoBAs have not been identified yet. The present study provides insight into the establishment of early gut microbiota and the interactive development of esterified BAs.The contribution of FA-isoBAs to gut physiology and their role in pathophysiologic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease are currently under investigation.",

			"abstract": "As rates of Cesarean delivery and common non-communicable disorders (NCDs), such as obesity, metabolic disease, and atopy/asthma, have concomitantly increased in recent decades, investigators have attempted to discern a causal link. One line of research has led to a hypothesis that Cesarean birth disrupts the presumed normal process of colonization of the neonatal microbiome with vaginal microbes, yielding NCDs later in life. However, a direct link between a disrupted microbiota transfer at time of delivery and acute and/or chronic illness in infants born via Cesarean has not been causally established. Microbiota seeding from maternal vaginal or stool sources has been preliminarily evaluated as an intervention designed to compensate for the lack of (or limited) exposure to such sources among Cesarean-delivered neonates. However, to date, clinical trials have yet to show a clear health benefit with neonatal 'vaginal seeding' practices. Until the long-term effects of these microbiome alterations can be fully determined, it is paramount to conduct parallel meaningful and mechanistic-minded interrogations of the impact of clinically modifiable maternal, nutritional, or environmental exposure on the functional microbiome over the duration of pregnancy and lactation to determine their role in the mitigation of childhood and adult NCDs.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal psychological distress could affect gut microbiota of the infant; however, previous studies to date have been observational. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) during pregnancy on the meconium microbiota of infants by alleviating maternal psychological distress. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHOD: Pregnant women with symptoms of depression or anxiety were randomized to either the intervention group (n = 80), comprising usual perinatal care and six digitally guided self-help MBI sessions, or the control group (n = 80) who underwent usual perinatal care. Meconium was collected within 48 h of birth to evaluate the infant's gut microbiota. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, analysis of similarities, and DESeq2 were performed to explore the effects of the MBI on alpha and beta diversity indices and specific genera. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups regarding the alpha diversity indices, including Chao1 and Simpson (p = 0.83 and p = 0.58). However, there was a significant between-group difference in the beta diversity index (R=0.02, p = 0.03). Bifidobacterium (log(2) fold change=-1.90, FDR=0.002) and Blautia (log(2) fold change=-1.45, FDR=0.01) were abundant in the intervention group, whereas Staphylococcus (log(2) fold change=1.44, FDR=0.01) was abundant in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: MBI aimed at alleviating maternal psychological distress can positively alter the meconium microbiota of infants.

Often rectal enemas and oral laxatives are used to manage these bowel evacuation disorders. METHODS: An online survey was sent to all 163 high-level Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) in Germany. The participants were queried on rectal enemas, laxative therapy and outcome incidences. RESULTS: A total of 110/163 (67.5%) hospitals participated in the study. 103/110 (93.6%) participating sites applied rectal enemas in cases of delayed meconium evacuation and 63/110 (57.3%) additionally used oral laxatives. In total, 15 different solutions and 7 different application systems were used for rectal instillation. Preterm infants receiving enemas within the first 48 hours after birth were found to have a significantly lower incidence of FIP (p = 0.006). Altogether 8 different oral laxatives were utilised. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic approaches to the management of prolongated meconium evacuation differ widely among German NICUs. Our survey highlights the diversity of applied substances, means of application and differences in duration and frequency of interventions. Macrogol was commonly used in neonates as an oral laxative despite the lack of approval from the manufacturer.",

This systematic review summarises the association between infant (ages 0-12 months) gut microbiota composition measured by genomic sequencing, and childhood (ages 0-18 years) respiratory diseases (ie, respiratory infections, wheezing, or asthma). Overall, there was evidence that low alpha-diversity and relative abundance of particular gut-commensal bacteria genera (Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and Roseburia) are associated with childhood respiratory diseases. However, results were inconsistent and studies had important limitations, including insufficient characterisation of bacterial taxa to species level, heterogeneous outcome definitions, residual confounding, and small sample sizes. Large longitudinal studies with stool sampling during the first month of life and shotgun metagenomic approaches to improve bacterial and fungal taxa resolution are needed.

This study primarily aimed to identify the incidence of and factors associated with meconium-related ileus and secondarily sought to investigate clinical and growth outcomes after water-soluble contrast media (Gastrografin) enema. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of very low birth weight infants born between February 2009 and March 2019 in the neonatal intensive care unit of a single medical center. Perinatal factors, clinical outcomes, and growth outcomes were compared between the group with meconium-related ileus that received Gastrografin enema and the control group. RESULTS: Twenty-four (6.9%) patients were diagnosed with meconium-related ileus among 347 very low birth weight infants. All achieved successful evacuation of meconium with an average of 2.8 (range: 1-8) Gastrografin enema attempts without procedure-related complications. Initiation of Gastrografin enema was performed at mean 7.0 days (range: 2-16) after birth. Incidences of moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia were higher and the duration of mechanical ventilation and need for oxygen were longer in the meconium-related ileus group (P = 0.039, 0.046, 0.048, respectively). Meconium-related ileus infants took more time to start enteral feeding and the nothing per oral time was longer (P = 0.001 and 0.018, respectively). However, time to achieve full enteral feeding and Z-scores for weight and height at 37 weeks and at 6 months corrected age did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrografin enema in very low birth weight infants with meconium-related ileus was an effective and safe medical management. Following Gastrografin enema, very low birth weight infants with meconium-related ileus achieved similar subsequent feeding progress and similar growth levels as the control groups without meconium-related ileus.",

We previously observed EV-sized particles by electron microscopy in the first-pass meconium of newborn infants. We hypothesized that EVs may be of bacterial origin and represent a novel entity in the human microbiome during fetal and perinatal periods. METHODS: We extracted EVs from first-pass meconium samples of 17 newborn infants and performed bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the vesicles. We compared the EV content from the meconium samples of infants based on the delivery mode, and in vaginal delivery samples, based on the usage of intrapartum antibiotics. RESULTS: We found bacterial EVs in all first-pass meconium samples. All EV samples had bacterial RNA. Most of the phyla present in the samples were Firmicutes (62%), Actinobacteriota (18%), Proteobacteria (10%), and Bacteroidota (7.3%). The most abundant genera were Streptococcus (21%) and Staphylococcus (17%). The differences between the delivery mode and exposure to antibiotics were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial EVs were present in the first-pass meconium of newborn infants. Bacterial EVs may represent an important novel feature of the gut microbiome during fetal and perinatal periods. IMPACT: We show that bacterial extracellular vesicles are present in the microbiome of first-pass meconium in newborn infants. This is a novel finding. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of bacterial extracellular vesicles in the gut microbiome during fetal and perinatal periods. This finding is important because bacterial extracellular vesicles are more likely to cross biological barriers than whole-cell bacteria.

We quantified phthalate metabolites in meconium from two cohorts of children at higher risk of adverse neurodevelopment and evaluated associations with their cognitive function at 12 months. METHODS: Meconium phthalate metabolites were quantified in the Safe Passage Study (SPS), N = 720, a pregnancy cohort with high community-levels of prenatal alcohol use, and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), N = 236, a high familial autism risk pregnancy cohort. EARLI also had second and third trimester (T2/T3) maternal urine for exposure assessment. Molar sum of di (2-ethylhexyl) ( summation operatorDEHP) metabolites and an anti-androgenic score (AAS) using mono-isobutyl, mono-n-butyl, monobenzyl (MBZP), and DEHP metabolites were computed. Cognitive function was assessed at 12 months using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning-Composite (ELC). Multivariable linear regression assessed associations between log(e)-transformed metabolites and ELC. Quadratic terms explored nonlinearity and interaction terms of metabolite by child's sex examined effect modification. RESULTS: In SPS, MBzP (beta(Linear) = -6.73; 95% CI: 12.04, -1.42; beta(quadratic) = 1.95; 0.27, 3.62) and mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl), (beta(Linear) = -3.81; -7.53, -0.27; beta(quadratic) = 0.93; 0.09, 1.77) had U-shaped associations with ELC. In EARLI, T2 urine mono-carboxyisononyl was associated with linear decrease in ELC, indicating lower cognitive function. Interaction with sex was suggested (P < 0.2) for several urine metabolites, mostly indicating negative association between phthalates and ELC among girls but reversed among boys. Only mono-isononyl phthalate and  summation operatorDEHP had consistent main effect associations across matrixes and cohorts, but similar interaction with sex was observed for meconium-measured  summation operatorDEHP, AAS, MBzP, and mono (2-ethylhexyl) in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Few phthalate metabolites were consistently associated with children's cognitive function, but a similar set of meconium metabolites from both cohorts displayed sex-specific associations. Gestational phthalate exposure may have sexually-dimorphic associations with early cognitive function in children at higher risk for adverse neurodevelopment.",

			"abstract": "Pregnancy and the postpartum period result in some of the most dramatic metabolic, hormonal, and physiological changes that can be experienced by an otherwise healthy adult. The timing and magnitude of these changes is key for both maternal and fetal health. One of the factors believed to critically modulate these physiological changes is the maternal gut microbiome. However, the dynamic changes in this community during the perinatal period remain understudied. Clinical studies can be complicated by confounding variables like diet and other drivers of heterogeneity in the human microbiome. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of the fecal microbiome obtained during the pregnancy and postpartum periods in 26 captive rhesus macaques using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. Shifts at both the taxonomic and functional potential level were detected when comparing pregnancy to postpartum samples. Taxonomically, Alloprevotella, Actinobacillus, and Anaerovibrio were enriched in the gut microbiome during pregnancy, while Treponema, Lachnospiraceae, and Methanosphaera were more abundant postpartum. Functionally, the gut microbiome during pregnancy was associated with increased abundance in pathways involving the production of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate, while pathways associated with starch degradation and folate transformation were more abundant during the postpartum period. These data demonstrate dramatic changes in the maternal gut microbiome even in the absence of dietary changes and suggest that rhesus macaques could provide a valuable model to determine how changes in the microbiome correlate to other physiological changes in pregnancy. IMPORTANCE Pregnancy and the postpartum period are characterized by a myriad of metabolic and physiological adaptations needed to support fetal growth and maternal health. The maternal gut microbiome is believed to play a key role during this period but remains underexplored. Here, we report significant shifts in the taxonomic landscape and functional potential of the gut microbiome in 26 pregnant rhesus macaques during the transition from pregnancy to the postpartum period, despite shared dietary and environmental exposures. Increased abundance of pathways involved in the production of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate could play a critical role in modulating the maternal immune system and regulating fetal tolerance. On the other hand, increased abundance of pathways associated with starch degradation and folate transformation during the postpartum period could be important for meeting the metabolic demands of breastfeeding and neonatal growth.",

The primary outcome measure was the offspring's childhood wheezing up to 3 years of age. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio for childhood wheezing in children of women with meconium-stained amniotic fluid, considering those without meconium-stained amniotic fluid as a reference, taking into account the potential confounding factors affecting the incidence of wheezing. We analyzed data from 61,991 participants: 1796 (2.9%) participants had meconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor and 18,919 (30.5%) of the offspring had childhood wheezing. The adjusted odds ratios for the offspring's childhood wheezing were 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.99) in total participants, 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.97) in term births, and 2.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.98-4.09) in preterm births. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a decreased incidence of childhood wheezing among the children of women with meconium-stained amniotic fluid in term births. By yet unknown mechanisms, meconium-stained amniotic fluid was associated with a decreased incidence of childhood wheezing in the offspring. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of one's own meconium in affecting their health condition. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Meconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor is associated with several adverse perinatal outcomes, and meconium aspiration syndrome is associated with offspring's childhood asthma and wheezing. * Meconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor could be an independent protective factor for the offspring's dermatitis and skin rash. WHAT IS NEW: * Whole cases with meconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor were associated with a decreased incidence of offspring's childhood wheezing up to 3 years of age. * This study may shed light on the effects of simple meconium-stained amniotic fluid on offspring's childhood health.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Southeast-Asia, where many conditions associated with dissemination of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) in the community are met, data from the community are scarce but show high ESBL-E carriage prevalence. Maternal ESBL-E colonization is considered a risk factor for neonatal colonization, which is the first step towards developing neonatal sepsis. Despite this, ESBL-E carriage prevalence and its risk factors during pregnancy or postpartum remain undefined in Southeast-Asia. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of ESBL-E faecal colonization among peripartum women in the community of an urban and a rural area in Cambodia, to investigate ESBL-E genomic characteristics and to identify associated risk factors. METHODS: Epidemiological data and faecal samples from 423 peripartum women were collected in an urban and rural areas in Cambodia (2015-16). Bacterial cultures, antibiotic susceptibility tests and ESBL gene sequencing were performed. Risk factor analysis was conducted using logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBL-E faecal carriage was 79.2% (95% CI 75.0%-82.8%) among which Escherichia coli (n = 315/335, 94.0%) were most frequent. All isolates were multidrug resistant. Among 318 ESBL-E, the genes most frequently detected were blaCTX-M-15 (41.5%), blaCTX-M-55 (24.8%), and blaCTX-M-27 (15.1%). Low income, undernutrition, multiparity, regular consumption of pork, dried meat, and raw vegetables, were associated with ESBL-E faecal carriage. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of ESBL-E carriage observed among peripartum women in Southeast-Asia and the identified associated factors underline the urgent need for public health measures to address antimicrobial resistance, including a 'One Health' approach.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aberrations in the preterm microbiome following antibiotic therapy have been reported in previous studies. The objective of this study was to probe potential underlying mechanisms between this observation and susceptibility to adverse prematurity-related outcomes. RESULTS: Metagenomic shotgun sequencing was performed on 133 stool and 253 skin samples collected at 1 and 3 weeks of age from 68 infants born at <36 weeks postmenstrual age and birth weight <2000 g. After accounting for gestational age and maternal antibiotics, the distribution of organisms in all samples and the corresponding metabolic pathway abundance were compared between infants exposed to postnatal antibiotics and antibiotics-naive infants. In antibiotic-naive infants, gestational and postnatal age imparted similar trajectories on maturation of the microbial community and associated metabolic functional capacity, with postnatal age exerting greater contribution. Antibiotic exposure was associated with reversal in maturation trajectory from the first week to the third week of age (p< 0.001). Butyrate-producing genera, including Clostridium and Blautia, were significantly more abundant in antibiotic-naive neonates at 3 weeks postnatal age. Correspondingly, metabolic pathways required for short-chain fatty acid synthesis were significantly increased in antibiotic-naive infants, but not in antibiotic-exposed neonates, at 3 weeks after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Early brief antibiotic exposure markedly disrupts developmental trajectory of the neonatal microbiome and its corresponding functional capacity. Our findings may provide a mechanistic explanation for the known associations between antibiotic use and adverse outcomes in preterm infants. Video Abstract.",

			"abstract": "Humans are colonised by a highly adapted microbiota with coevolved functions that promote human health, development and disease resistance. Acquisition and assembly of the microbiota start at birth and recent evidence suggests that it coincides with, and informs, immune system development and regulation in the rapidly growing infant. Several large-scale studies have identified Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species maternally transmitted to infants, many of which are capable of colonising over the longer term. Disruption of maternal transmission by caesarean section and antibiotic exposure around birth is associated with a higher incidence of pathogen colonisation and immune-related disorders in children. In this review, we discuss key maternally transmitted bacterial species, their sources and their potential role in shaping immune development. Maternal transmission of gut bacteria provides a microbial 'starter kit' for infants which promotes healthy growth and disease resistance. Optimising and nurturing this under-appreciated form of kinship should be considered as a priority.",

Much is known about the harmful effects of the use and indirect consumption of pesticides; however, the assessment of long-term contamination is still unclear. In this sense, the use of hair as an alternative biological matrix has some advantages, such as segmentation, which makes it possible to assess the presence of xenobiotics to which individuals have been exposed over the years, and possibly relate this exposure to symptoms or diseases that may affect them. Complementarily, the other matrices discussed are able to provide information about the exposure of mothers and newborn children, who may have been indistinctly exposed to pesticides while in the womb. Through the analysis of studies already performed, it can be observed that organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are the most likely to be found within the biological matrices discussed here, due to the lipophilic characteristics of these compounds. For the other classes, biotransformation products are more easily detected.",

			"article_name": "Can Umbilical Cord and Meconium Results Be Directly Compared? Analytical Approach Matters.",
			"abstract": "Maternal drug use during pregnancy is a significant concern. Drug-exposed newborns are often born premature and may suffer from birth defects, neonatal abstinence syndrome and cognitive and developmental delays. Because of this, testing of neonatal specimens is carried out to assess fetal drug exposure during pregnancy. Umbilical cord tissue (UC) and meconium are commonly used specimens for this purpose. However, comprehensive studies comparing drug positivity rates and concentration in the two specimen types are lacking. To this end, 4,036 paired UC and meconium specimens originating from 13 states within the USA were identified, and retrospective analysis of drug positivity rates and drug concentration was performed for 31 analytes in 5 drug classes. Testing for 11-Nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) is a separate orderable for UC specimen at our laboratory, so a second data set was created for evaluation of this drug analyte with 2,112 paired UC and meconium specimens originating from 11 states. Testing of UC was performed by semi-quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) assays, whereas, for meconium, an immunoassay-based screening preceded LC-MS-MS confirmation tests. Results generated for UC and meconium specimens were therefore compared for a total of 32 drug analytes from 6 drug classes. Drug concentrations for analytes were higher in meconium compared to UC, with the exception of phencyclidine. Despite this, the positivity rates for individual analytes were higher in UC, with the exception of THC-COOH and cocaine. Furthermore, analysis for multidrug positivity revealed that THC-COOH and opioids were the most common multidrug combination detected in both matrices. In conclusion, this study suggests that for most drug compounds, UC was more analytically sensitive to assess neonatal drug exposure by current methodologies. Additionally, by demonstrating that meconium has higher drug concentrations for most compounds, this study sets the stage for developing more sensitive assays in meconium.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) involves meconium-induced lung inflammation and surfactant inactivation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with diluted surfactant facilitates the removal of meconium. CHF5633, one of the most promising synthetic surfactants, is effective in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Here we investigated its efficacy via BAL in an experimental MAS model. METHODS: Experimental MAS was induced at birth in near-term newborn rabbits by intratracheal instillation of reconstituted human meconium. First, undiluted CHF5633 was compared with a porcine-derived surfactant (Poractant alfa) via intratracheal bolus (200 mg/kg). Second, the efficacy of BAL with diluted CHF5633 (5 mg/mL, 20 ml/kg) alone, or followed by undiluted boluses (100 or 300 mg/kg), was investigated. RESULTS: Meconium instillation caused severe lung injury, reduced endogenous surfactant pool, and poor survival. CHF5633 had similar benefits in improving survival and alleviating lung injury as Poractant alfa. CHF5633 BAL plus higher boluses exerted better effects than BAL or bolus alone in lung injury alleviation by reversing phospholipid pools and mitigating proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression, without fluid retention and function deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: CHF5633 improved survival and alleviated meconium-induced lung injury, the same as Poractant alfa. CHF5633 BAL plus boluses was the optimal modality, which warrants further clinical investigation. IMPACT: To explore the efficacy of a synthetic surfactant, CHF5633, in neonatal lung protection comparing with Poractant alfa in a near-term newborn rabbit model with meconium-induced lung injury. Similar effects on improving survival and alleviating lung injury were found between CHF5633 and Poractant alfa. Optimal therapeutic effects were identified from the diluted CHF5633 bronchoalveolar lavage followed by its undiluted bolus instillation compared to the lavage or bolus alone regimens. Animals with CHF5633 lavage plus bolus regimen exerted neither substantial lung fluid retention nor lung mechanics deterioration but a trend of higher pulmonary surfactant-associated phospholipid pools.",

			"abstract": "Antibiotic application during the perinatal period is unavoidable in the clinic, but the potential effects on mothers and infants remain unknown. Herein, 25 breast milk samples from mothers who received cefuroxime (CXM) or CXM + cefoxitin (CFX) treatments and fecal samples from their infants were collected to investigate the undesirable effects of antibiotics on the microbiota of mothers and neonates. Furthermore, five fecal samples of infants, whose mothers had antibiotic treatments, were collected at a 6-month postpartum follow-up visit to evaluate the long-term effects on infants' gut microbiota. Moreover, the relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in fecal samples was compared to investigate the transfer of ARGs in the infant gut microbiota. The results indicated that the antibiotic treatments had no influence on the microbiota of breast milk. The dominant bacterial phyla in the fecal samples changed to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria after antibiotic treatments, while the bacterial community showed a recuperative trend at the follow-up visits. In addition, the abundance of ARGs in the infant gut microbiota demonstrated a declining trend in the CXM- and CXM + CFX-treated groups, while ARG abundance presented a significant increasing trend after a 6-month recovery period. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic treatments for mothers during the perinatal period disturb the gut microbiota in neonates. The infants' gut microbiota would partly return to their initial state after rehabilitation, but the transfer of ARGs would leave the hidden trouble of antibiotic resistance. Overall, the data presented here can help to guide the scientific use of antibiotics during the perinatal period and provide potential approaches to mitigate the negative consequences. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Antibiotic application during the perinatal period is unavoidable in the clinic. * Misuse of antibiotics can cause various unintended consequences, especially for antibiotic resistance. WHAT IS NEW: * Antibiotic treatments had no influence on the microbiota of breast milk but greatly disturbed the gut microbiota composition in infants. * The gut microbiota in infants would partly return to its initial state after rehabilitation but the transfer of ARGs would leave the hidden trouble of antibiotic resistance.",

Therefore, studying and comparing normal and dysbiotic microbiomes requires the elucidation of both the fetal and infant microbiomes. Factors influencing the normal microbiome also include regional and genetic factors specific to different countries. Determining the normal microbiome population in our center and their association with the clinical conditions of infants is helpful as a tool for both the prevention and treatment of related diseases during neonatal care. Here, we employed metagenomic sequencing to characterize meconium and the subsequent early-life gut microbiome of preterm neonates in Jakarta, Indonesia. Microbiome diversity and complexity was higher in the meconium and on day 4 than on day 7. At the genus level, the most abundant genus overall was unidentified Enterobacteriaceae, with meconium samples dominated by Ureaplasma, day 4 fecal samples dominated by Staphylococcus, and day 7 samples dominated by Clostridiales, while at the phylum level the most abundant was Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Perinatal factors of PROM and mother's diet influenced the meconium microbiome, while day 4 and day 7 microbiome was associated with bacteremia and early administration of antibiotics. One of our sample sets was derived from triplets, and they had varying diversity despite being triplets. These data are valuable for understanding the formation of a healthy microbiome specific to neonates and devising a strategy to improve both the gut health and related clinical outcomes of the neonate.",

However, little is known about their dynamic colonization and influencing elements among the first two-year infancy as well as into the adulthood. So based on the 16S rRNA sequencing data among 30 healthy breast-feeding mother-infant pairs with normal ranges of growth and development indicators from birth to two years old, the dynamic colonization of gut microbiota and its influencing factors were discussed using this birth cohort. Among these, we identified that the diversity of gut microbiota was significantly increased from six-month to two-year subgroups. The significantly dynamic trends of gut microbiota at the phylum (genus) level were that the percents of Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Enterococcus, Subdoligranulum, Agathobacter, unidentified_Erysipelotrichaceae, Staphylococcus, unidentified_Ruminococcaceae, and Fusicatenibacter), Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were increased, while Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium) and Proteobacteria (unidentified-Enterobacteriaceae and Klebsiella) were decreased with the increased ages from six months to two years old, which might simultaneously modulate the host pathways, such as the higher percents of chemoheterotrophy and fermentation, and lower percentages of nitrate_reduction, aerobic_chemoheterotrophy and so on. Furthermore, there were significant associations between maternal (milk microbiota, pre-pregnancy BMI, BMI increment during the pregnancy)/infant characteristics (BMI at birth and BMI gain), and the compositions of gut microbiota. However, no differences of gut microbiota were shown between the different sex and productive mode subgroups. Overall, the colonization of gut microbiota is significantly matured into the adulthood with the increased ages to two-years old and regulated by the above maternal/infant characteristics, which will provide a new direction for the host-gut microbiota interplay during the first two years of life.",

However, data regarding the clinical significance and the prognostic value of the presence of meconium-stained amnionic fluid (MSAF) are scarce. This study aimed to investigate delivery and neonatal outcomes according to the presence of MSAF and the timing of the meconium passage. METHODS: We used an historical cohort study at a single tertiary medical center in Israel between the years 2011 and 2018. Women were divided into two groups according to timing of meconium passage: primary MSAF (MSAF present at membrane rupture) and secondary MSAF (clear amnionic fluid that transitioned to MSAF during labor). Neonatal complication rates were compared between groups. Composite adverse neonatal outcome was defined as arterial cord blood pH &lt;7.1, 5 min Apgar score </=7, and/or neonatal intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: The study cohort included 56 863 singleton term births. Of these, 9043 (15.9%) were to women who had primary MSAF, and 1484 (2.6%) to those with secondary MSAF. Secondary MSAF compared with primary MSAF increased the risks of cesarean birth and operative vaginal delivery, increased the risks of low one- and five-minute Apgar scores and low arterial cord blood pH, and increased hospital stay duration. Multivariate analysis revealed that secondary MSAF was independently associated with an increased risk of composite adverse neonatal outcome (OR1.68, 95% CI 1.25-2.24, p &lt; 0.001) compared with primary MSAF. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, secondary MSAF was associated with more adverse neonatal outcomes than primary MSAF. Closer monitoring of fetal well-being may be prudent in these cases.",

Children's neurodevelopment was measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ-3) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at 24 months postnatally (n = 287). RESULTS: Compared with the No-symptoms group, children in the Symptoms group had a higher degree of hyperactivity and total difficulties at 24 months of age. Increases in alpha diversity, distinct overall composition, enriched relative abundance of Proteobacteria, and different predicted microbial functions were observed in the meconium of neonates exposed to maternal prenatal emotional symptoms. The neonatal gut microbiota alpha diversity and relative abundance of genera from the Proteobacteria phylum and Lactobacillus were negatively correlated with children's degree of prosocial behavior, tendency toward hyperactivity, and poor fine motor development. In addition, mediating effects of neonatal meconium microbial richness and the relative abundance of Lactobacillus were observed between maternal emotional symptoms and children's prosocial behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal prenatal emotional symptoms are associated with alterations in the offspring meconium microbiota and children's neurodevelopment at 24 months of age, and the microbial richness indices and Lactobacillus may play a mediating role. Future research is needed to identify and understand the biological pathways and metabolisms linking the relationships among maternal emotional symptoms, meconium microbiota, and neurodevelopment of children.",

			"article_name": "Individuality of the Extremely Premature Infant Gut Microbiota Is Driven by Ecological Drift.",
			"abstract": "The initial contact between humans and their colonizing gut microbiota after birth is thought to have expansive and long-lasting consequences for physiology and health. Premature infants are at high risk of suffering from lifelong impairments, due in part to aberrant development of gut microbiota that can contribute to early-life infections and inflammation. Despite their importance to health, the ecological assembly and succession processes governing gut microbiome composition in premature infants remained incompletely understood. Here, we quantified these ecological processes in a spatiotemporally resolved 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data set of 60 extremely premature neonates using an established mathematical framework. We found that gut colonization during the first months of life is predominantly stochastic, whereby interindividual diversification of microbiota is driven by ecological drift. Dispersal limitations are initially small but have increasing influence at later stages of succession. Furthermore, we find similar trends in a cohort of 32 healthy term-born infants. These results suggest that the uniqueness of individual gut microbiota of extremely premature infants is largely due to stochastic assembly. IMPORTANCE Our knowledge concerning the initial gut microbiome assembly in human neonates is limited, and scientific progression in this interdisciplinary field is hindered due to the individuality in composition of gut microbiota. Our study addresses the ecological processes that result in the observed individuality of microbes in the gastrointestinal tract between extremely premature and term-born infants. We find that initial assembly is mainly driven by neutral ecological processes. Interestingly, while this progression is predominantly random, limitations to the dispersal of microbiota between infants become increasingly important with age and are concomitant features of gut microbiome stability. This indicates that while we cannot predict gut microbiota assembly due to its random nature, we can expect the establishment of certain ecological features that are highly relevant for neonatal health.",

However, little is known about the development of the gut virome in preterm infants, or its role in NEC. Here, using metagenomic sequencing, we characterized the DNA gut virome of 9 preterm infants who developed NEC and 14 gestational age-matched preterm infants who did not. Infants were sampled longitudinally before NEC onset over the first 11 weeks of life. We observed substantial interindividual variation in the gut virome between unrelated preterm infants, while intraindividual variation over time was significantly less. We identified viral and bacterial signatures in the gut that preceded NEC onset. Specifically, we observed a convergence towards reduced viral beta diversity over the 10 d before NEC onset, which was driven by specific viral signatures and accompanied by specific viral-bacterial interactions. Our results indicate that bacterial and viral perturbations precede the sudden onset of NEC. These findings suggest that early life virome signatures in preterm infants may be implicated in NEC.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most existing evidence about the prevalence of prenatal cannabis use relies on self-reported measures, which is limited by social desirability bias and recall bias. To date, several studies have examined the validity of self-reported measures of prenatal cannabis use, but this evidence has yet to be synthesized. To address this gap, we performed a scoping review to systematically identify and synthesize existing evidence on the validity of self-reported measures of cannabis use among pregnant women. METHODS: We searched PubMed, PyschINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane/CENTRAL, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2010 and June 2021. We included studies that compared self-reported measures of cannabis use to a biochemical measure of cannabis (e.g., urine, hair, meconium) in pregnant women. We excluded studies reporting solely on prenatal cannabis use prevalence as well as those that examined self-reported drug use in which cannabis use was not a distinct category. RESULTS: We found 12 unique studies (11 primary studies and one systematic review) that examined the validity of self-reported prenatal cannabis use, compared to a biochemical sample. Most studies were conducted in the US and conducted in either a hospital or clinical setting. We found that self-report was more valid in populations with a current or prior history of drug use. Self-report was also more valid when assessed via interviews by research team members than health care provider screenings or self-administered surveys. The most commonly used biochemical measure used was urine drug testing, which was found to have the highest level of concordance with self-report. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review systematically mapped existing evidence on the validity of self-reported prenatal cannabis use. Although much remains unknown in this area, an important next step is a systematic review that would provide robust evidence on clinical utilization of self-reported use in conjunction with biochemical samples. Further research is needed to examine validity by type of measure and mode of administration. Additionally, future studies could assess factors associated with disclosure of use across different critical maternal health periods beyond pregnancy.",

			"abstract": "Diarrhea is responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 children each year, many of whom reside in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). Additionally, children with multiple diarrheal infections early in life have increased growth stunting and malnutrition and decreased vaccine efficacy. Two bacteria that contribute to the burden of diarrhea are Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, both are endemic in Bangladesh. However, not all children that are exposed to these pathogens, including Campylobacter, will experience diarrhea. We hypothesized that host genetics may influence susceptibility to Campylobacter infections and performed a genome-wide association study in 534 children from two independent birth cohorts in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Infants were monitored for diarrhea for the first 2 years of life and only defined as controls if all diarrheal samples in the first year were negative for Campylobacter jejuni/C. coli. Each cohort was analyzed separately under an additive model and adjusted for length-for-age z-scores at birth and 12 months, sex, water treatment, and ancestry. In a fixed effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of these two cohorts, we identified a genome-wide significant region on chromosome 8 in intron 4 of the rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 gene (ARHGEF10). Individuals with the G allele (rs13281104) had a 2-fold lower risk of having a Campylobacter-associated diarrheal episode than individuals with the A allele (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.58, P = 3.6 x 10(-7)). This SNP is associated with decreased expression of the neighboring gene, CLN8, which may be involved in the transport of the cytolethal distending toxin produced by Campylobacter. IMPORTANCE Children in low-to-middle-income countries often suffer from multiple enteric infections in their first few years of life, many of which have the potential for long-lasting effects. These children are already likely to be malnourished and underweight, and chronic intestinal disturbances exacerbate these conditions. Despite public health interventions aimed at improving water, sanitation, and hygiene, enteric infections are still a leading cause of death for children under five. Previous work has included transmission dynamics, pathogen characteristics, and evaluation of interventions. Here, we examined the role of host genetic variation in susceptibility to diarrhea-associated Campylobacter infection. In our meta-analysis of two independent birth cohorts from Dhaka, Bangladesh, we found that children carrying a specific genetic variant (rs13281104, in an intron of ARHGEF10) were half as likely to have a diarrhea-associated Campylobacter infection in their first year of life. This protective effect may be achieved by decreasing gene expression and thereby impacting host-pathogen interactions and host immune response.",

			"abstract": "Immune system maturation begins early in life, but few studies have examined how early-life gut microbiota colonization educates the neonatal immune system. Bifidobacteria predominate in the intestines of breastfed infants and metabolize human milk oligosaccharides. This glycolytic activity alters the intestinal microenvironment and consequently stimulates immune system maturation at the neonatal stage. However, few studies have provided mechanistic insights into the contribution of 'infant-type' Bifidobacterium species, especially via metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. In this review, we highlight the first 1000 days of life, which provide a window of opportunity for infant-type bifidobacteria to educate the neonatal immune system. Furthermore, we discuss the instrumental role of infant-type bifidobacteria in the education of the neonatal immune system by inducing immune tolerance and suppressing intestinal inflammation, and the potential underlying mechanism of this immune effect in the first 1000 days of life. We also summarize recent research that suggests the administration of infant-type bifidobacteria helps to modify the intestinal microecology and prevent the progress of immune-mediated disorders.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a devastating pregnancy complication that increases the risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. This study aims to determine the combined and relative effects of genetic and intrauterine environments on neonatal microbial communities and to explore selective FGR-induced gut microbiota disruption, metabolic profile disturbances and possible outcomes. DESIGN: We profiled and compared the gut microbial colonisation of 150 pairs of twin neonates who were classified into four groups based on their chorionicity and discordance of fetal birth weight. Gut microbiota dysbiosis and faecal metabolic alterations were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA and metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics, and the long-term effects were explored by surveys of physical and neurocognitive development conducted after 2~3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Adverse intrauterine environmental factors related to selective FGR dominate genetics in their effects of elevating bacterial diversity and altering the composition of early-life gut microbiota, and this effect is positively related to the severity of selective FGR in twins. The influence of genetic factors on gut microbes diminishes in the context of selective FGR. Gut microbiota dysbiosis in twin neonates with selective FGR and faecal metabolic alterations features decreased abundances of Enterococcus and Acinetobacter and downregulated methionine and cysteine levels. Correlation analysis indicates that the faecal cysteine level in early life is positively correlated with the physical and neurocognitive development of infants. CONCLUSION: Dysbiotic microbiota profiles and pronounced metabolic alterations are associated with selective FGR affected by adverse intrauterine environments, emphasising the possible effects of dysbiosis on long-term neurobehavioural development.",

			"article_name": "Digestive outcomes in Cystic fibrosis.",
			"abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent life-limiting autosomal recessive disease in Caucasians, affecting the respiratory tract, but also the pancreas, gut, and hepatobiliary tract. CF is caused by variants in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Prognosis of CF has markedly improved over the last 20 years because of the management in CF centers and recent introduction of CFTR modulators, aimed at correcting the defective CFTR protein. There are nowadays more CF adults than children, with a predicted median survival age of around 50 years in high-income countries. Around 85% of CF patients have pancreatic insufficiency present at birth. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is more frequent in CF patients, but its role on decline in lung health is controversial. Distal small bowel obstruction syndrome (DIOS) caused by meconium-like stool plugs occurs at any age after the neonatal period, affecting up to 15-20% of CF patients. Because of increased life expectancy, most CF patients are expected to live to their fifties or beyond, when cancer is more frequent. In addition, CF is associated with a higher risk for GI malignancy as compared with the general population. Colorectal cancer represents the most significant risk, and colonoscopy-based screening is recommended from 40 years of age onwards. Other digestive outcomes in CF reviewed in this paper include meconium ileus, Clostridium difficile infection, intussusception, acute appendicitis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, appendiceal mucocele and rectal prolapse. Every CF Center should comprise a gastroenterologist with expertise in the care of CF patients.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the main variations in gut microbiota compositions, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations and autoinducer-2 (AI-2) levels in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants with feeding intolerance (FI). METHODS: Twenty-seven VLBW infants with gestational ages of </=30 weeks were divided into the FI group (n=14) and feeding tolerance (FT) group (n=13). The gut microbiota composition and SCFAs concentrations and AI-2 levels in feces were detected at 2 and 4 weeks after birth. RESULTS: There was no difference in alpha diversity between the two groups at 2 and 4 weeks after birth (P>0.05). Although the Chao index decreased (P<0.05), there was no difference in the Shannon index from 2 weeks to 4 weeks in either the FI or FT group (P>0.05). Additionally, there was no difference in beta diversity between the FI and FT groups at 2 weeks (P>0.05), but there was a significant difference in beta diversity between the two groups at 4 weeks (P<0.05) and a large difference from 2 weeks to 4 weeks in both the FI and FT groups (P<0.05). Furthermore, the composition of the microbiota at 4 weeks was significantly different from that at 2 weeks in the FI group (P<0.05). The Veillonella abundance was lower at 4 weeks in the FI group (P<0.05), but there were no differences in the compositions of the other main microbes between the two groups (P>0.05). Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were dominant in both the FI and FT groups. The concentrations of propanoic, valeric and hexanoic acids were lower in the FI group at 2 weeks, and the levels of isobutyric and valeric acids were lower at 4 weeks after birth (P<0.05). The areas under the curves (AUCs) of propanoic, butanoic and valeric acids in predicting FI were 0.878, 0.816 and 0.744, respectively. Compared with that in the FT group, the relative bioluminescence of AI-2 was lower in the FI group at 2 weeks (P<0.05), and the AUC was 0.736.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The total sample size comprised of 73 cases in both groups. These patients were further subdivided into 2 groups: the MSAF group and the control group. 38 women were in the MSAF group and 35 women with term amniotic fluid serum were in the control group. The MSAF group was selected as a full-term singleton amniotic fluid fecal infection group. Clinical data were collected, and specimens were collected. Fecal staining of amniotic fluid and full-term amniotic fluid removes the placenta and umbilical cord blood. The expression of HMGB1 in the placenta was observed by immune-histochemical staining of MSAF and control groups. The content of PON-1 in cord blood was determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Correlation between maternal and neonatal clinical data and MSAF was done; MSAF group mean gestational age was 41.38 +/- 1.40 weeks; control group mean gestational age was 39.20 +/- 1.24 weeks. This study found no correlation between the birth weight, maternal age, sex, first/transmaternal, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and anemia between the MSAF and control group with nonsignificant P value (P > 0.05). However, the fatal age, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, umbilical cord abnormalities, placental abnormalities, and neonatal asphyxia factors were statistically different with a significant P value of <0.05 between both groups. HMGB1 and Periodontal P. gingivalis are mostly expressed in placental trophoblast, vascular endothelial cells, and amniotic epithelial and interstitial cells. After HE staining of 72 placentas by HE in MSAF and control, 6 had acute chorioamnionitis (5.1 control), 32 had chronic (23.9), 35 had abnormal placentas, and three in MSAF had chorionic columnar metaplasia. In immune-histochemistry experiments, the HMGB1 expression intensity of placental tissue was higher in the MSAF group (P < 0.05); however, the level of PON-1 was lower in the MSAF group as compared to the controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age and placental abnormalities are clinical high-risk factors for MSAF. HMGB1, PON-1, MCP-1, and Periodontal P. gingivalis may be involved in the development of MSAF, suggesting an oxidative/antioxidant imbalance with inflammation, and may be one of the mechanisms for MSAF development.",

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in preterm infants from 28 weeks + 0days to 30 weeks + 6days of gestation. Thirty preterm infants were randomly selected after birth to receive either probiotics or placebo. Stool samples were collected before product intake and then sequentially during the first weeks of their admission. Classical microbiological, metagenomics and multiplex immunological analyses were performed to assess the bacterial and immune profile of the samples. RESULTS: Twenty-seven infants completed the study (14 vs 13, probiotic and placebo groups). A higher number of participants were colonized by Lactobacilli in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (93% vs 46%; P  = 0.013). Similar results were obtained when analysing bifidobacterial colonization (100% vs 69%; P  = 0.041). Earlier colonization was observed in the probiotics group versus the placebo group, specifically 5 weeks for Lactobacillus and 1 week for Bifidobacterium. Although no effect was observed in the faecal immunological profile, a decreasing trend could be observed in Th17 response during the first week of probiotic treatment. None of the adverse events (AEs) registered were related to product intake. CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation with L salivarius PS11603 and B longum subsp. infantis PS10402 enhanced an earlier colonization of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in preterm infants' guts in 5 and 1 week, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the bacterial composition of the first-pass meconium is associated with the development of allergic diseases before 4 years of age. METHODS: Prospective birth cohort study. Bacterial composition of first-pass meconium was analysed using bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Atopic and allergic diseases were evaluated via online survey or telephone to age 4 years, based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire.

Outcome data at 4 years were available for 177 (83%) children, and 159 of these had sufficient amplification of bacterial DNA in meconium. Meconium microbiota composition, including diversity indices and relative abundances of the main phyla and genera, was not associated with subsequent atopic eczema, wheezing or cow's milk allergy. Principal components analysis did not identify any clustering of the meconium microbiomes of children with respect to wheezing or cow's milk allergy.

In the present study, the meconium microbiome composition and the predicted microbial metabolic pathways were analysed in a consecutive cohort of 96 full-term newborns. The effect of maternal epidemiological variables on meconium diversity was analysed using regression analysis and PERMANOVA. Meconium microbiome composition mainly included Proteobacteria (30.95%), Bacteroidetes (23.17%) and Firmicutes (17.13%), while for predicted metabolic pathways, the most abundant genes belonged to the class \"metabolism\".

Characters of maternal-neonatal microbiota were analyzed from two distinct populations in similar latitude but different continents (Oriental Asia and Europe). A total number of 120 healthy families from China (n=60) and Spain (n=60) were included. Maternal and neonatal microbiota profiles were obtained at birth by 16S rRNA gene profiling. Clinical records were collected. Geographical location influenced maternal-neonatal microbiota. Indeed, neonatal and maternal cores composed by nine genera each one were found independently of location. Geographical location was the most important variable that impact the overall structure of maternal and neoantal microbiota. For neonates, delivery mode effect on neonatal microbial community could modulate how the other perinatal factors, as geographical location or maternal BMI, impact the neoantal initial seeding. Furthermore, lower maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with higher abundance of Faecalibacterium in maternal microbiota and members from Lachnospiraceae family in both mothers and infants. At genus-level, Chinese maternal-neonate dyads possessed higher number of phylogenetic shared microbiota than that of Spanish dyads. Bifidobacterium and Escherichia/Shigella were the genera most shared between dyads in the two groups highlighting their importance in neonatal colonization and mother-infant transmission. Our data showed that early gut microbiota establishment and development is affected by interaction of complex variables, where environment would be a critical factor.",

			"abstract": "In neonates, rotavirus (RV) infection is generally nosocomial. The control of rotaviral infection within hospital settings is challenging due to prolonged shedding of the virus and contamination of the surrounding environment. There are few studies that have reported asymptomatic infection within neonates. In this study, neonates were screened for RV infection and possible clinical manifestations that may play a role in RV acquisition were analysed. Stool samples were collected from 523 hospitalized neonates admitted for > 48 h in a low-cost and higher-cost tertiary centre. RV antigen was screened using ELISA and the samples which tested positive were confirmed by semi-nested RT-PCR. RV was detected in 34% of participants and genotypes identified included G12P[11] (44.4%), G10 P[11] (42.6%), G10G12P[11] (10.1%) and G3P[8] (2.9%). ICU admissions were associated with higher viral shedding (p < 0.05). Hospitalization in the low-cost facility ICU was associated with higher RV acquisition risk (p < 0.05). RV was detected in higher rates (36.9%) among neonates with gastrointestinal manifestations. G10P[11] was the predominant genotype for several years (1988-2016) among neonates within India. The preponderance of an emerging G12P[11] genotype and heterotypic distribution was documented. RV surveillance is important to identify emerging strains and establish the road ahead in managing RV infection.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) cases from active facility-based surveillance in Guatemala. METHODS: We collected clinical and risk factor data on enrolled patients (aged 0-52 years) with acute diarrhoea at government healthcare facilities (1 hospital and 6 clinics) in Santa Rosa, Guatemala, during 2008-2009 and 2014-2015. Stool samples were analysed, E. coli identified through culture and biochemical tests, PCR amplification of genes encoding pathotype-specific virulence factors identified specific DEC pathotypes. Healthcare-seeking adjusted incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 3041 diarrhoea cases were captured by surveillance (647 hospitalisations (H), 2394 clinic visits (CV)); general E. coli prevalence was 17.9%. DEC pathotypes were identified in 19% (n = 95/497) and 21% (n = 450/2113) in diarrhoea H and CV, respectively. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was most frequently isolated (8.2% (n = 41) in diarrhoea H, 12.0% (n = 255) in diarrhoea CV), followed by ETEC (6.8% (n = 34) in H, 6% (n = 128) in CV) and STEC (0.6% (n = 3) in H, 0.6% (n = 13) in CV). We did not find evidence of a difference in severity between DEC and non-DEC diarrhoea. Incidence of DEC clinic visits and hospitalisations was 648.0 and 29.3, respectively, per 10,000 persons aged </=5 years and 36.8 and 0.4, respectively, per 10,000 persons aged >5 years. CONCLUSIONS: DEC pathotypes, especially EPEC and ETEC, were detected frequently from patients presenting with diarrhoeal illness in Santa Rosa, Guatemala. Our findings suggest that preventive interventions should be prioritised for young children.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the pediatric population, severe Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) sometimes occurs, but most cases are asymptomatic. The asymptomatic carriage rate in pediatric populations is reportedly higher than in the adult population. It is difficult to diagnose CDI, even if C. difficile is detected in children with diarrhea. This study aimed to evaluate the positivity rate of toxigenic C. difficile in the pediatric population with diarrhea. METHODS: We collected and retrospectively analyzed gastrointestinal pathogen multiplex PCR results of 960 patients to estimate the positivity rate of toxigenic C. difficile in pediatric populations aged between 0 and 18 years. RESULTS: The overall rate of C. difficile toxin B positivity was 10.1% in the stool samples. The positivity rate peaked in 1-year-old infants (29/153, 19.0%) and continually decreased thereafter. The positivity rate we observed was lower than the rates described in the literature. Remarkably, no C. difficile was detected in neonates. Antibiotic usage was inversely related to the positivity rate, especially in infants < 2 years of age. The odds ratio of antibiotics was 0.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.68; P < 0.001). The presence of concomitant gastrointestinal pathogens was not associated with toxigenic C. difficile positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Even though toxigenic C. difficile infection is neither an important nor a common cause of pediatric diarrhea, children can spread it to adults at risk of developing CDI. The pediatric population can act as hidden reservoirs for pathogenic strains in the community.",

			"abstract": "Different infant diets have strong effects on child development and may engender variations in fecal microbiota and metabolites. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an infant formula containing sn-2 palmitate on fecal microbiota and metabolites in healthy term infants. The study involved three groups as indicated below. Investigational: the group fed a formula containing high sn-2 palmitate for 16 weeks. Control: the group fed a formula using a regular vegetable oil for 16 weeks. Breastfed: the group fed breast milk for 16 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 8 weeks (n = 35, 37, and 35, respectively) and 16 weeks (n = 30, 32, and 30, respectively) for the control, investigational, and breastfed infants. Microbiota data were obtained using 16S rRNA sequencing. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis was performed using GC-MS, and untargeted metabolomics was conducted using LC-MS. The effect of the formula containing sn-2 palmitate was different from that of the control formula on microbiota and metabolites. Sn-2 palmitate promoted the proliferation of Bifidobacterium and reduced the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella at 8 weeks. Furthermore, it increased alpha-diversity and enhanced acetate content in feces at both 8 and 16 weeks. In the investigational group infants, the abundance of DL-tryptophan, indole-3-acrylic acid, acetyl-beta-methylcholine, L-methionine, and 2-hydroxyvaleric acid significantly increased at 8 weeks, while a notable increase in the abundance of 3-phenyllactic acid, palmitic acid, L-phenylalanine, and leucylproline was observed at 16 weeks. In addition, compared with that of the control infants, the intestinal microbiota and metabolites of sn-2 palmitate-supplemented infants were more similar to those of the breastfed infants. The study hopes to provide a scientific basis for the development of functional infant formulas in the future.",

			"abstract": "Regulating the composition of human breastmilk has the potential to prevent allergic diseases early in life. The composition of breastmilk is complex, comprising varying levels of oligosaccharides, immunoactive molecules, vitamins, metabolites, and microbes. Although several studies have examined the relationship between different components of breastmilk and infant food allergies, few have investigated the relationship between microorganisms in breastmilk and infant food allergy. In the present study, we selected 135 healthy pregnant women and their full-term newborns from a cohort of 202 mother-infant pairs. Among them, 69 infants were exclusively breastfed until 6 mo after birth. At follow-up, 11 of the 69 infants developed a food allergy in infancy while 22 showed no signs of allergy. Thirty-three breastmilk samples were collected within 1 mo after delivery, and 123 infant fecal samples were collected at five time points following their birth. These samples were analyzed using microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The abundance and evenness of the milk microbiota and the number of differential bacteria were higher in the breastmilk samples from the non-allergy group than in those from the food allergy group. The non-allergy group showed relatively high abundance of Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Clostridium IV, Clostridium XIVa, Veillonella, and butyrate-producing bacteria such as Fusobacterium, Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus. In contrast, the abundance of Proteobacteria, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas in breastmilk was higher in the food allergy group. A comparison of the changes in dominant differential breastmilk microbiota in the intestinal flora of the two groups of infants over time revealed that the changes in Bifidobacterium abundance were consistent with those in the breastmilk flora. Functional pathway prediction of breastmilk microflora showed that the enhancement of the metabolic pathways of tyrosine, tryptophan, and fatty acids was significantly different between the groups. We suggest that changes in the breastmilk microbiota can influence the development of food allergies. Breastmilk contains several microbes that have protective effects against food allergies, both by influencing the colonization of intestinal microbiota and by producing butyrate. This study may provide new ideas for improving infant health through early intervention with probiotics.",

However, where and when ARGs are acquired remains unclear, as does the types of ARGs acquired. Herein, we recruited 82 pairs of women and their caesarean section newborns. Conventional culture methods and quantitative PCR were employed to detect nine species and six ARG types in meconia, faeces from 3-day-old newborns, amniotic fluid, colostrum, and hospital ward air samples. Furthermore, ARG transfer was explored by tracking Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from faeces of 3-day-old newborns, colostrum and ward air samples using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). No ARGs or microorganisms were detected in meconia or amniotic fluid. One or more ARGs were detected in 90.2% of faeces from 3-day-old newborns, and the mecA gene exhibited the highest detection rate (45.1%). ARGs were detected in 85.4% of colostra consistent with ARGs in faeces from 3-day-old newborns. Some ARGs were detected in ward air, and might also be a source of ARGs in neonatal faeces. Isolation of S. epidermidis from neonatal faeces was consistent with antibiotic resistance and gene profiles for colostrum samples. Traceability analysis of S. epidermidis showed that ARGs in neonatal faeces mainly originated from colostrum, and partly from ward air. After birth, neonates born by caesarean section obtain a variety of ARGs mainly from colostrum, and partly from ward air.",

			"abstract": "Paclitaxel is often excluded during pregnancy for women with breast cancer due to limited neonatal follow-up. We confirmed in utero fetal Paclitaxel exposure for 8 newborns. Birth details and follow-up to 36 months of age is reported. Meconium samples from newborns exposed to chemotherapy were screened by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry while blinded to maternal treatment during pregnancy. Newborn information at birth and annually was obtained. Mean gestational age (GA) at cancer diagnosis and start of chemotherapy was 8.7 + 6.2 weeks and 17.1 +/- 3.5 weeks. Paclitaxel was started at a mean GA of 27.0 +/- 5.8 weeks. Paclitaxel followed Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide in 6 cases, 5-Fluouracil/Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide in 1, and was used alone in 1. Mean number of days between Paclitaxel and birth was 23 +/- 15. Identification of Paclitaxel and/or metabolites was made in all meconium from paclitaxel-exposed fetuses. Birthweight was < 10% for GA in 3 infants. Three anomalies occurred: mild hip dysplasia without further treatment and mitral valve stenosis. The third child was diagnosed with Cleidocranial Dysostosis, a familial anomaly. Mean age at pediatric follow-up is 18.7 + 9.3 months. Pediatricians report eczema and recurrent otitis media in 1 child, iron deficiency anemia and upper respiratory infection in 2. One child is < 10% for height and weight at 15 months. All are meeting developmental milestones at median age of 18.7 months, range: 6-36 months. CONCLUSION: Up to 3 years of age, follow-up of neonates exposed to Paclitaxel in utero is reassuring. Continued observation of neonatal development is essential. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Chemotherapy during the second and third trimester of pregnancy does not result in an increase in congenital malformations or developmental delay. * In non-human primate studies by Van Calsteren et al., variable plasma and/or tissue concentrations of taxanes, carboplatin, and trastuzumab were encountered in the fetal compartment. * Pilot data reported by the current investigators proved that paclitaxel crosses the human placenta.

Current techniques to study the preterm gut microbiome are appraised, and the potential of recent methodological advancements is discussed. What advances does it highlight? Recent findings in the field achieved by the application of advanced technologies, the applicability of intestinally derived organoid models to study host-microbiome interactions in the preterm gut, and recent developments in enhancing the physiological relevance of such models. Preterm intestinally derived organoids may provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying preterm disease, as well as diagnosis and treatment opportunities. These models have huge translational potential, offering a step towards precision medicine. ABSTRACT: Accumulating evidence affirms the importance of the gut microbiome in both health and disease. In early life, there exists a critical period in which the composition of gut microbes is particularly malleable and subject to a wide range of influencing factors. Disturbances to microbial communities during this time may be beneficial or detrimental to short and long-term health outcomes. For infants born prematurely, naive immune systems, immature gastrointestinal tracts and additional clinical needs put this population at high risk of abnormal microbial colonisation, resulting in increased susceptibility to diseases including necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). Traditional cell culture methods, gnotobiotic animals, molecular sequencing techniques (16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics) and advanced 'omics' technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) have been fundamental in exploring the associations between diet, gut microbes, microbial functions and disease. Despite significant investment and ongoing research efforts, prevention and treatment strategies in NEC and LOS remain limited. Recent endeavours have focused on searching for new, more physiologically relevant models to simulate the preterm intestine. Preterm intestinally derived organoids represent a promising in vitro approach in the study of host-microbiome interactions in the preterm infant gut, offering new and exciting possibilities in this field.",

While recent evidence suggests that meconium is sterile in utero, rapid colonization occurs after birth. The meconium microbiome has been associated with negative health outcomes, but its composition is not well described, especially in preterm infants. Here, we characterized the meconium microbiomes from 330 very preterm infants (gestational ages 28 to 32 weeks) from 15 hospitals in Germany and in fecal samples from a subset of their mothers (N = 217). Microbiome profiles were compiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing with negative and positive controls. The meconium microbiome was dominated by Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus spp. and was associated with gestational age at birth and age at sample collection. Bifidobacterial abundance was negatively correlated with potentially pathogenic genera. The amount of bacterial DNA in meconium samples varied greatly across samples and was associated with the time since birth but not with gestational age or hospital site. In samples with low bacterial load, human mitochondrial sequences were highly amplified using commonly used, bacterial-targeted 16S rRNA primers. Only half of the meconium samples contained sufficient bacterial material to study the microbiome using a standard approach. To facilitate future meconium studies, we present a five-level scoring system (\"MecBac\") that predicts the success of 16S rRNA bacterial sequencing for meconium samples. These findings provide a foundational characterization of an understudied portion of the human microbiome and will aid the design of future meconium microbiome studies.

The objective of this paper was to perform a meta-analysis to examine the impact of endotracheal suctioning on the occurrence of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), mortality, and complications. STUDY DESIGN: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched for comparative studies. Odds ratios (ORs), weighted mean differences (WMDs), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. There were no significant impacts of endotracheal suctioning on the occurrence of MAS (OR = 3.05, 95% CI: 0.48-19.56), mortality (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 0.35-4.44), the need for mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.20, 95% CI: 0.32-54.72), the occurrence of pneumothorax (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.34-2.85), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.58-2.98), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.52-1.30), and length of stay (WMD = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.99-0.77).

METHODS: The incidences of complicated MRI requiring aggressive enema or surgical intervention and other intestinal complications were compared among period 1 (January 2012-December 2013, n = 79), before adoption of the antenatal MgSO4 protocol for fetal neuroprotection; period 2 (January 2014-March 2016, n = 72), when the protocol was adopted; and period 3 (April 2016-September 2018, n = 75), when the protocol was temporarily withdrawn due to concern regarding intestinal complications in EPIs. RESULTS: Despite similar baseline clinical characteristics among infants across the study periods, the MRI and MRI with surgical treatment incidences were higher in period 2 than those in periods 1 and 3 (13% vs. 8% and 6%, p = 0.391, and 11% vs. 0% and 1%, p = 0.001, respectively). In multivariable analysis, exposure to antenatal MgSO4 independently increased the risk of MRI (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.4, 10.6). CONCLUSION: Antenatal MgSO4 may increase the risk of MRI, frequently requiring surgical intervention, in EPIs with a gestational age of 25 weeks or less.",

STUDY DESIGN: Single-center retrospective study of >/=36-week gestation neonates with MSAF. RESULTS: During routine-suction era (9/2013-12/2014), 280/2306 neonates (12%) were born through MSAF and 39 (14%) were non-vigorous. Thirty (77%) of non-vigorous infants underwent tracheal suctioning. In the no-suction era (1/2017-12/2018), 282/2918 neonates (9.7%) were born through MSAF and 30 (10.6%) were non-vigorous and one needed intubation. Admissions for meconium aspiration syndrome (15% vs 53%) and respiratory distress (18% vs 57%) were significantly higher among non-vigorous infants in the no-suction era. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, non-vigorous infants born through MSAF without routine-tracheal suctioning had a higher incidence of NICU admission for MAS and respiratory distress compared to the routine-suction era. Multicenter randomized trials evaluating tracheal suction in non-vigorous infants with MSAF are warranted.",

			"abstract": "Disturbances in the primary colonization of the infant gut can result in lifelong consequences and have been associated with a range of host conditions. Although early-life factors have been shown to affect infant gut microbiota development, our current understanding of human gut colonization in early life remains limited. To gain more insights into the unique dynamics of this rapidly evolving ecosystem, we investigated the microbiota over the first year of life in eight densely sampled infants (n = 303 total samples). To evaluate the gut microbiota maturation transition toward an adult configuration, we compared the microbiome composition of the infants to that of the Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP) population (n = 1,106). We observed the infant gut microbiota to mature through three distinct, conserved stages of ecosystem development. Across these successional gut microbiota maturation stages, the genus predominance was observed to shift from Escherichia over Bifidobacterium to Bacteroides. Both disease and antibiotic treatment were observed to be associated occasionally with gut microbiota maturation stage regression, a transient setback in microbiota maturation dynamics. Although the studied microbiota trajectories evolved to more adult-like constellations, microbiome community typing against the background of the FGFP cohort clustered all infant samples within the (in adults) potentially dysbiotic Bacteroides 2 (Bact2) enterotype. We confirmed the similarities between infant gut microbial colonization and adult dysbiosis. Profound knowledge about the primary gut colonization process in infants might provide crucial insights into how the secondary colonization of a dysbiotic adult gut can be redirected. IMPORTANCE After birth, microbial colonization of the infant intestinal tract is important for health later in life. However, this initial process is highly dynamic and influenced by many factors. Studying this process in detail requires a dense longitudinal sampling effort. In the current study, the bacterial microbiota of >300 stool samples was analyzed from 8 healthy infants, suggesting that the infant gut microbial population matures along a path involving distinct microbial constellations and that the timing of these transitions is infant specific and can temporarily retrace upon external events. We also showed that the infant microbial populations show similarities to suboptimal bacterial populations in the guts of adults. These insights are crucial for a better understanding of the dynamics and characteristics of a \"healthy gut microbial population\" in both infants and adults and might allow the identification of intervention targets in cases of microbial disturbances or disease.",

We investigated the association between maternal exposure to environmental pollutants and changes in early-life gut microbiome development. We surveyed 16S rRNA gene on meconium and fecal samples (at 1, 3, and 6 months) from the Brazilian birth cohort, and associated with levels of metals, perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS), and pesticides in maternal and umbilical cord blood. The results indicate that the magnitude of the microbiome changes associated with increasing pollutant exposure was bigger in cesarean-section (CS) born and CS-born-preterm babies, in relation to vaginally (VG) delivered infants. Breastfeeding was associated with a stronger pollutant-associated effect on the infant feces, suggesting that the exposure source could be maternal milk. Differences in microbiome effects associated with maternal or cord blood pollutant concentrations suggest that fetal exposure time - intrauterine or perinatal - may matter. Finally, despite the high developmental microbiota variability, specific microbionts were consistently affected across all pollutants, with taxa clusters found in samples from infants exposed to the highest toxicant exposure. The results evidence that perinatal exposure to environmental pollutants is associated with alterations in gut microbiome development which may have health significance.",

We measured site-specific incidence rate by using Poisson regression models, identified the risk factors and estimated the associations of strain carrying genes of EAEC with the composite EED score and linear growth at 24 months of age. Overall highest incidence rate (43.3%) was found among children having infection with the aggR gene, which was the greatest in Tanzania (56.7%). Low maternal education, lack of improved floor, and ownership of domestic cattle were found to be risk factors for EAEC infection. In the multivariate models, after adjusting the potential covariates, strain carrying genes of EAEC showed strong positive associations with the EED scores and with poor linear growth at 24 months of age.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are generally fed through nasogastric enteral feeding tubes (NEFTs). The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of NEFTs in the initial colonization of the preterm gut and its evolution within the first 2 weeks after birth. METHODS: For this purpose, fecal and NEFT-derived samples from 30 preterm infants hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were collected from birth to the second week of life. Samples were cultivated in ten culture media, including three for the isolation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Isolates (561) were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Although the first NEFTs inserted into the neonates after birth were rarely colonized, analysis of NEFTs and fecal samples over time revealed a significant increase in bacterial abundance, diversity, and detection frequency. Results showed a parallel colonization between time-matched NEFTs and fecal samples, suggesting an ongoing bidirectional transfer of bacteria from the neonatal gut to the NEFTs and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: In short-term hospitalization, length is by far the determinant factor for the early colonization of preterm infants. As NEFT populations reflect the bacterial populations that are colonizing the preterm in a precise moment, their knowledge could be useful to prevent the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant strains. IMPACT: The hospital environment modulates preterm colonization immediately after birth. The colonization of preterm feces and NEFTs occurs in parallel. There is an ongoing bidirectional transfer of microorganisms from the neonatal gut to the NEFTs and vice versa. Bacterial communities inside NEFTs could act as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes. NEFT populations reflect the bacteria that are colonizing the preterm at a precise moment.",

In this pilot observational study, we aimed to unveil the relation between dynamic succession of the gut microbiota in very low birth weight infants during the first month of life and their neurodevelopment, assessed at 24-month corrected age. According to our data, the early-life gut microbiota of preterm infants with normal vs. impaired neurodevelopment followed distinct temporal trajectories with peculiar compositional rearrangements. In this context, early Bifidobacterium deficiency appears to be a negative biomarker of adverse neurological outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our data might pave the way for future in-depth studies focusing on the potential impact of bifidobacteria or specific microbiota patterns on neonatal neurodevelopment and lay the foundation for microbiome-based clinical practices to modulate altered profiles and improve long-term health. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Preterm infants are at increased risk for adverse neurological outcomes and gut microbiota dysbiosis. * The gut microbiota and the nervous system share critical developmental windows in early life. WHAT IS NEW: * The absence of Bifidobacterium at 30 days of life in preterm infants is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in early childhood. * The administration of Bifidobacterium strains could promote optimal neurocognitive development in fragile infants.",

Human meconium microbiota transplants to germ-free mice were conducted to investigate whether the meconium microbiota is causally related to the preterm infant phenotype in an experimental model. Our results indicate that very preterm birth is associated with a distinct meconium microbiota composition. Fecal microbiota transplant of very preterm infant meconium results in impaired growth, altered intestinal immune function, and metabolic parameters as compared to term infant meconium transplants in germ-free mice.

It is not known which initial infant colonizers elicit optimal neurodevelopment; thus, this study investigated the association between gut microbiome succession from the first week of life and head circumference growth (HCG), the earliest validated marker for neurodevelopment. Fecal samples were collected weekly from a preterm infant cohort during their neonatal intensive care unit stay and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing for evaluating gut microbiome composition, in conjunction with clinical data and head circumference measurements. Preterm infants with suboptimal HCG trajectories had a depletion in the abundance/prevalence of Bacteroidota and Lachnospiraceae, independent of morbidity and caloric restriction. The severity of gut microbiome depletion matched the timing of significant HCG pattern separation between study groups at 30-week postmenstrual age demonstrating a potential mediating relationship resultant from clinical practices. Consideration of the clinical variables indicated that optimal infant microbiome succession is primarily driven by dispersal limitation (i.e., delivery mode) and secondarily by habitat filtering (i.e., antibiotics and enteral feeding). Bacteroidota and Lachnospiraceae are known core taxa of the adult microbiome, with roles in dietary glycan foraging, beneficial metabolite production and immunity, and our work provides evidence that their integration into the gut microbiome needs to occur early for optimal neurodevelopment.",

Furthermore, the relative abundances of Clostridiaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae were significantly altered in infants exposed to IAT as compared to nonexposed infants at 1 month of age. The observed deviations in gut microbiota composition between infants exposed and not exposed to IAT diminished by the age of 6 months.

Mother provides probiotics and prebiotics factors through colostrum and maternal milk to shape the first neonatal microbiota. Previous works have reported that immunoglobulin A (IgA) secreted in colostrum is coating a fraction of maternal microbiota. Thus, to better characterize this IgA-microbiota association, we used flow cytometry coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (IgA-Seq) in human colostrum and neonatal feces. We identified IgA bound bacteria (IgA+) and characterized their diversity and composition shared in colostrum fractions and neonatal fecal bacteria. We found that IgA2 is mainly associated with Bifidobacterium, Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, and Paracoccus, among other genera shared in colostrum and neonatal fecal samples. We found that metabolic pathways related to epithelial adhesion and carbohydrate consumption are enriched within the IgA2+ fecal microbiota. The association of IgA2 with specific bacteria could be explained because these antibodies recognize common antigens expressed on the surface of these bacterial genera. Our data suggest a preferential targeting of commensal bacteria by IgA2, revealing a possible function of maternal IgA2 in the shaping of the fecal microbial composition in the neonate during the first days of life.",

Previous studies have shown high rates of CRE colonisation among patients at hospitals in LMICs, with increased risk of hospital-acquired infections. METHODS: We isolated carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) from faecal samples collected in 2017 from patients at admission and discharge at a Vietnamese neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 126 CRKP were whole-genome sequenced. The phylogenetic relationship between the isolates and between clinical CRKP isolates collected in 2012-2018 at the same hospital were investigated. RESULTS: NDM-type carbapenemase-(61%) and KPC-2-encoding genes (41%) were the most common carbapenem resistance genes observed among the admission and discharge isolates. Most isolates (56%) belonged to three distinct clonal clusters of ST15, carrying bla(KPC-2), bla(NDM-1) and bla(NDM-4), respectively. Each cluster also comprised clinical isolates from blood collected at the study hospital. The most dominant ST15 clone was shown to be related to isolates collected from the same hospital as far back as in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: Highly resistant CRKP were found colonising admission and discharge patients at a Vietnamese NICU, emphasising the importance of continued monitoring. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a population of CRKP consisting mostly of ST15 isolates in three clonally related clusters, each related to blood isolates collected from the same hospital. Furthermore, clinical isolates collected from previous years (dating back to 2012) were shown to likely be clonally descended from ST15 isolates in the largest cluster, suggesting a successful hospital strain which can colonise inpatients.",

We studied the epidemiology of and risk factors for soil-transmitted helminth infections from birth to 8 years of age in tropical Ecuador. METHODS: 2,404 newborns were followed to 8 years of age with periodic stool sample collections. Stool samples were collected also from household members at the time of the child's birth and examined by microscopy. Data on social, environmental, and demographic characteristics were collected by maternal questionnaire. Associations between potential risk factors and STH infections were estimated using generalized estimated equations applied to longitudinal binary outcomes for presence or absence of infections at collection times. RESULTS: Of 2,404 children, 1,120 (46.6%) were infected with at least one STH infection during the first 8 years of life. The risk of A. lumbricoides (16.2%) was greatest at 3 years, while risks of any STH (25.1%) and T. trichiura (16.5%) peaked at 5 years. Factors significantly associated with any STH infection in multivariable analyses included age, day-care (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03-1.73), maternal Afro-Ecuadorian ethnicity (non-Afro vs. Afro, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43-0.70) and lower educational level (secondary vs. illiterate, OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22-0.45)), household overcrowding (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.21-1.94)), having a latrine rather than a water closet (WC vs. latrine, OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.95)), and STH infections among household members (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.59-2.58)).

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meconium peritonitis (MP) is a sterile, chemical peritonitis resulting from in-utero fetal bowel perforation. Severe cases may lead to serious morbidities and mortalities. OBJECTIVE: To review the common antenatal ultrasound abnormalities associated with MP, and identify radiological and clinical prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all neonates with MP from January 1997 to December 2019 treated in our hospital was performed. Antenatal ultrasound findings, clinical presentations and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five neonates (17 males, 18 females) were included in the study. Thirty-two (91.4%) attended antenatal screening, and 27 (84.4%) of them had abnormalities identified on antenatal ultrasound. The most common abnormality was polyhydramnios (43.8%). Nineteen (54.3%) patients were inborn. Twenty (57.1%) patients were born prematurely. Laparotomy was required in 85.7% of patients. The median time to laparotomy was shorter in the inborn group [1 day (0-9 days) vs 4 days (2-34 days), p = 0.001], but the duration of post-operative hospital stay was comparable [71 days (16-423 days) vs 73.5 days (23-231 days)]. However, such duration was found to be significantly longer in the pre-term group when compared to full-term [58.5 days (16-89 days) vs 85 (21-423 days), p = 0.01]. The most common pathology was small bowel atresia and there were two mortalities. CONCLUSION: Due to the advancement in prenatal detection, pediatric anesthesia, intensive care and surgical techniques, the morbidity and mortality of MP has much decreased. Effective multi-disciplinary antenatal counseling facilitated the perinatal management of MP and resulted in comparable prognosis and outcome in inborn and outborn neonates.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is one of the principal reasons for childhood diarrhea around the world. This work aimed to differentiate Cryptosporidium species among children suffering from diarrhea in Sharkyia Governorate, Egypt. METHODOLOGY: A total of 97 fecal specimens were taken from children suffering from diarrhea, attending Pediatric Clinics of Zagazig University and Al-Ahrar Hospitals. Full history was taken. Stool samples were examined microscopically using modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. To identify Cryptosporidium genotypes, positive samples were then subjected to nested Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism targeting Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein gene. RESULTS: The overall detection rate was 27.8% (27/97) using modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain staining method. Using nested polymerase chain reaction, the gene was amplified in 85.2% (23/27). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that 65.2% (15/23) were Cryptosporidium hominis, 30.4% (7/23) were Cryptosporidium parvum, and one sample was not typed (4.4%). The significant risk factors associated with Cryptosporidium infection in children were animal contact and residence in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium is a common enteric parasite affecting children in Sharkyia Governorate, Egypt, with the predominance of C. hominis genotype in children.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: On 1 December 2020, the Department of Disease Control of Thailand was notified of a cluster of food poisoning cases among participants at a church festival in Mae Ai district, Chiang Mai province. We conducted an outbreak investigation to confirm diagnosis, describe the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, identify possible sources of the outbreak and provide appropriate control measures. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of the food poisoning cases from the health care centres. Active case finding was conducted among participants who had consumed food and water at the festival. An environmental survey was done in the village where the festival was held. A case-control study was conducted to identify the source of the outbreak. Samples for laboratory analysis included rectal swabs and fresh stool specimens from the cases and food handlers, surface swabs of cooking equipment, food, water and ice samples. RESULTS: Among 436 participants surveyed, 368 (84.4%) cases of food poisoning were identified. The most common clinical manifestation was abdominal pain (89.7%), followed by watery diarrhoea (45.7%), nausea (43.5%), vomiting (38.9%), fever (18.5%) and bloody diarrhoea (4.6%). None died in this outbreak. The case-control study showed that mixed spicy seafood salad served in the festival was significantly associated with the disease by both univariable and multivariable analyses. However, the causative agent could not be identified. The environmental investigation suggested this seafood might have been undercooked. CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of the cases, incubation period and the suspected seafood salad suggested seafood-related food poisoning. Grimontia hollisae, the organism causing illness similar to Vibrio parahaemolyticus and commonly undetectable in the laboratory with routine testing, might be the pathogen that caused this outbreak. G. hollisae should be in differential diagnosis and identified in seafood-associated outbreaks.",

			"abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is among the most relevant gastrointestinal diseases affecting mostly prematurely born infants with low birth weight. While intestinal dysbiosis has been proposed as one of the possible factors involved in NEC pathogenesis, the role of the gut microbiota remains poorly understood. In this study, the gut microbiota of preterm infants was explored to highlight differences in the composition between infants affected by NEC and infants prior to NEC development. A large-scale gut microbiome analysis was performed, including 47 shotgun sequencing data sets generated in the framework of this study, along with 124 retrieved from publicly available repositories. Meta-analysis led to the identification of preterm community state types (PT-CSTs), which recur in healthy controls and NEC infants. Such analyses revealed an overgrowth of a range of opportunistic microbial species accompanying the loss of gut microbial biodiversity in NEC subjects. Moreover, longitudinal insights into preterm infants prior to NEC development indicated Clostridium neonatale and Clostridium perfringens species as potential biomarkers for predictive early diagnosis of this disease. Furthermore, functional investigation of the enzymatic reaction profiles associated with pre-NEC condition suggested DL-lactate as a putative metabolic biomarker for early detection of NEC onset. IMPORTANCE Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal disease occurring predominantly in premature infants whose etiology is still not fully understood. In this study, the analysis of infant fecal samples through shotgun metagenomics approaches revealed a marked reduction of the intestinal (bio)diversity and an overgrowth of (opportunistic) pathogens associated with the NEC development. In particular, dissection of the infant's gut microbiome before NEC diagnosis highlighted the potential involvement of Clostridium genus members in the progression of NEC. Remarkably, our analyses highlighted a gastrointestinal DL-lactate accumulation among NEC patients that might represent a novel potential functional biomarker for the early diagnosis of NEC.",

To assess their local epidemiology and genetic diversity, stool samples of 7509 inpatients with gastrointestinal complaints from all age groups were analyzed. After detection of norovirus genogroup I and II RNA by real-time RT-PCR, viral capsids were genotyped by partial nucleic acid sequencing. In the case of GII.2 strains, polymerase genotypes were also assessed. Between October 2013 and September 2017, presence of norovirus RNA was shown in 611 samples (8.1%), of which 610 (99.8%) were typed successfully. Norovirus positivity rate was higher in patients aged below five years (14.8%) than in older patients (5.7%). Among the 611 norovirus positive samples, GII.4 (56.6%) strains prevailed, followed by GII.6 (11.3%), GII.3 (11.0%) and GII.2 (9.5%). The most common genogroup I (GGI) genotype was GI.3 (3.6%). In addition, rare genotypes such as GII.13, GII.14 and GII.26 were detected. Interestingly, GII.3 infections were most common in children under the age of five years. Assessment of polymerase genotypes in GII.2 viruses showed a shift from P2 to P16, with higher diversity in P2 sequences. The varying distribution of norovirus genotypes depending on season, age and setting of infection highlights the importance of frequent genotyping as a basis for vaccine development and needful adjustments.",

			"article_name": "Early-life formula feeding is associated with infant gut microbiota alterations and an increased antibiotic resistance load.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infants are at a high risk of acquiring fatal infections, and their treatment relies on functioning antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are present in high numbers in antibiotic-naive infants' gut microbiomes, and infant mortality caused by resistant infections is high. The role of antibiotics in shaping the infant resistome has been studied, but there is limited knowledge on other factors that affect the antibiotic resistance burden of the infant gut. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the impact of early exposure to formula on the ARG load in neonates and infants born either preterm or full term. Our hypotheses were that diet causes a selective pressure that influences the microbial community of the infant gut, and formula exposure would increase the abundance of taxa that carry ARGs. METHODS: Cross-sectionally sampled gut metagenomes of 46 neonates were used to build a generalized linear model to determine the impact of diet on ARG loads in neonates. The model was cross-validated using neonate metagenomes gathered from public databases using our custom statistical pipeline for cross-validation. RESULTS: Formula-fed neonates had higher relative abundances of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Clostridioides difficile. The relative abundance of ARGs carried by gut bacteria was 69% higher in the formula-receiving group (fold change, 1.69; 95% CI: 1.12-2.55; P = 0.013; n = 180) compared to exclusively human milk-fed infants. The formula-fed infants also had significantly less typical infant bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria, that have potential health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The novel finding that formula exposure is correlated with a higher neonatal ARG burden lays the foundation that clinicians should consider feeding mode in addition to antibiotic use during the first months of life to minimize the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant gut bacteria in infants.",

			"abstract": "Intestinal microbiota has emerged as an important player in the health and disease of preterm infants. The interactions between intestinal flora and epithelium can lead to local injury and systemic diseases. A suitable in vitro cell model is needed to enhance our understanding of these interactions. In this study, we exposed fetal epithelial cell cultures (FHs-74 int cells, human, ATCC CCL 241) to sterile fecal filtrates derived from stool collected from preterm infants at <2 and at 3 to 4 weeks of age. We measured the cytokine levels from the culture media after 4, 24, and 48 h of exposure to the fecal filtrates. We analyzed the 16S rRNA V4 gene data of the fecal samples and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the fetal epithelial cells after 48 h of exposure to the same fecal filtrates. The results showed correlations between inflammatory responses (both cytokine levels and gene expression) and the Proteobacteria-to-Firmicutes ratio and between fecal bacterial genera and epithelial apoptosis-related genes. Our in vitro cell model can be further developed and applied to study how the epithelium responds to different microbial flora from preterm infants. Combining immature epithelial cells and preterm infant stool samples into one model allows us to investigate disease processes in preterm infants in a way that had not been previously reported. IMPORTANCE The gut bacterial flora influences the development of the immune system and long-term health outcomes in preterm infants. Studies of the mechanistic interactions between the gut bacteria and mucosal barrier are limited to clinical observations, animal models, and in vitro cell culture models for this vulnerable population. Most in vitro cell culture models of microbe-host interactions use single organisms or adult origin cell lines. Our study is innovative and significant in that we expose immature epithelial cells derived from fetal tissues to fecal filtrates from eight stool samples from four preterm infants to study the role of intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, we analyzed epithelial gene expression to examine multiple cellular processes simultaneously. This model can be developed into patient-derived two- or three-dimensional cell cultures exposed to their own fecal material to allow better prediction of patient physiological responses to support the growing field of precision medicine.",

Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and late onset sepsis (LOS) are the main cause of death in preterm infants surviving the initial days of life. METHODS: This review will explore and summarise the current literature exploring metabolomics in preterm infants. RESULTS: There are a relatively limited number of studies investigating metabolomics in preterm infants with NEC and/or LOS and matched controls. Nonetheless, it is evident across longitudinally age-related metabolomic studies that there are significant changes in metabolite profiles post-partum and over the first year of life. Existing studies have reported associations between the metabolite profiles of serum, urine and stool in health and disease in preterm infants. Although some studies have found selected metabolites are associated with disease, the specific metabolites vary from study to study, and larger studies are required. Excitingly, recent work has also begun to untangle how microbially produced metabolites can impact immunoregulation of the infant.

Analysis of fecal metagenomes collected from 13 full-term and 9 preterm infants reveals that infants' initially distinct microbiomes converge by age 1 year. Approximately 11% of early colonizers, primarily Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, persist during the first year of life, and those are more prevalent in full-term, compared with preterm infants. Examination of 17 mother-infant pairs reveals maternal gut strains are significantly more likely to persist in the infant gut than other strains. Enrichment in genes for surface adhesion, iron acquisition, and carbohydrate degradation may explain persistence of some strains through the first year of life.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is associated with the development of acute and chronic disease, potentially, through the disruption of normal gut microbiome development. Probiotics may correct for microbial imbalances and mitigate disease risk. Here, we used amplicon sequencing to characterise the gut microbiome of probiotic-treated premature infants. We aimed to identify and understand variation in bacterial gut flora from admission to discharge and in association with clinical variables. METHODS: Infants born <32 weeks gestation and <1500 g, and who received probiotic treatment, were recruited in North Queensland Australia. Meconium and faecal samples were collected at admission and discharge. All samples underwent 16S rRNA short amplicon sequencing, and subsequently, a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: 71 admission and 63 discharge samples were collected. Univariate analyses showed significant changes in the gut flora from admission to discharge. Mixed-effects modelling showed significantly lower alpha diversity in infants diagnosed with either sepsis or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and those fed formula. In addition, chorioamnionitis, preeclampsia, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis and ROP were also all associated with the differential abundance of several taxa. CONCLUSIONS: The lower microbial diversity seen in infants with diagnosed disorders or formula-fed, as well as differing abundances of several taxa across multiple variables, highlights the role of the microbiome in the development of health and disease. This study supports the need for promoting healthy microbiome development in preterm neonates. IMPACT: Low diversity and differing taxonomic abundances in preterm gut microbiota demonstrated in formula-fed infants and those identified with postnatal conditions, as well as differences in taxonomy associated with preeclampsia and chorioamnionitis, reinforcing the association of the microbiome composition changes due to maternal and infant disease.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of an MOS-supplemented infant formula on gut microbiota and intestinal immunity. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, healthy term formula-fed infants aged 21-26 d either received an intact protein cow milk-based formula (control group, CG, n = 112) or the same formula containing 7.2 g MOS/L (experimental group, EG, n = 114) until the age of 6 mo. Exclusively human milk-fed infants (HFI, n = 70) from an observational study served as the reference. Fecal samples collected at baseline, and the ages of 2.5 and 4 mo were assessed for microbiota (16S ribosomal RNA-based approaches), metabolites, and biomarkers of gut health and immune response. RESULTS: Aged 2.5 and 4 mo, redundancy analysis (P = 0.002) and average phylogenetic distance (P < 0.05) showed that the overall microbiota composition in EG was different from CG and closer to that of HFI. Similarly, EG caesarean-born infants were different from CG caesarean- or vaginally born infants and approaching HFI vaginally born infants. Relative bifidobacteria abundance was higher in EG compared with CG (P < 0.05) approaching HFI. At the age of 4 mo, counts of Clostridioides difficile and Clostridium perfringens were  approximately 90% (P < 0.001) and  approximately 65% (P < 0.01) lower in EG compared with CG, respectively. Geometric LS mean (95% CI) fecal secretory IgA in EG was twice that of CG [70 (57, 85) compared with 34 (28, 42) mg/g, P < 0.001] and closer to HFI. Fecal oral polio vaccine-specific IgA was  approximately 50% higher in EG compared with CG (P = 0.065). Compared with CG, EG and HFI had lower fecal calcium excretion (by  approximately 30%, P < 0.005) and fecal pH (P < 0.001), and higher lactate concentration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Infant formula with MOS shifts the gut microbiota and metabolic signature closer to that of HFI, has a strong bifidogenic effect, reduces fecal pathogens, and improves the intestinal immune response.",

Data on the prevalence of ESBL fecal carriage remain scarce in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of ESBL producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae fecal carriage among children under five years in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2017. A total of 269 fecal/rectal swab samples were cultured on MacConkey agar. All positive cultures were characterized by colony morphology, Gram stain, and standard biochemical tests. Further, bacteria identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and phenotypic detection of ESBL production were performed using VITEK 2 Compact as per the instruction of the manufacturer. Socio-demographic and risk factors data were collected using questionnaires. Data were entered by EPI INFO version 7.2.1.0 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 17.1% (46/269; 95% CI: 12.9%-22.7%). A total of 47 isolates were ESBL-positive, of which, 83.0% were E. coli and 17.0% were K. pneumoniae. ESBL producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were also showed high levels of MDR (93.6%) and high rates of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, all isolates were carbapenem susceptible.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the high prevalence rate of ESBL producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae fecal carriage and high level of multidrug resistance among ESBL producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae were demonstrated. This suggested that the necessity of routine screening of ESBL is crucial for the early detection and appropriate antibiotics selection for infection caused by ESBL producing pathogens.",

Here, we present the development of a hands-on and robust protocol for proton (1)H NMR spectroscopy of infant feces. The influence of extraction solvent, dilution ratio, homogenization method, filtration, and duration of centrifugation on the biochemical composition of infant feces was carefully evaluated using visual inspection of (1)H NMR spectra in combination with multivariate statistical modeling. The optimal metabolomics protocol was subsequently applied on feces from seven infants collected at 8 weeks, 4, and 9 months of age. Interindividual variation was exceeding the variation induced by different fecal sample preparation methods, except for filtration. We recommend extracting fecal samples using water with a dilution ratio of 1:5 feces-to-water to homogenize using bead beating and to remove particulates using centrifugation. Samples collected from infants aged 8 weeks and 4 months showed elevated concentrations of milk oligosaccharide derivatives and lactic acid, whereas short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) were higher in the 9 month samples. The established protocol enables hands-on and robust analyses of the infant gut metabolome. The wide-ranging application of this protocol will facilitate interlaboratory comparison of infants' metabolic profiles and finally aid in a better understanding of infant gut health.",

			"abstract": "Detection of bacterial DNA within meconium is often cited as evidence supporting in utero colonization. However, many studies fail to adequately control for contamination. We aimed to define the microbial content of meconium under properly controlled conditions. DNA was extracted from 141 meconium samples and subjected to cpn60-based microbiome profiling, with controls to assess contamination throughout. Total bacterial loads of neonatal meconium, infant stool, and controls were compared by 16S rRNA quantitative PCR (qPCR). Viable bacteria within meconium were cultured, and isolate clonality was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Meconium samples did not differ significantly from controls with respect to read numbers or taxonomic composition. Twenty (14%) outliers with markedly higher read numbers were collected significantly later after birth and appeared more like transitional stool than meconium. Total bacterial loads were significantly higher in stool than in meconium, which did not differ from that of sequencing controls, and correlated well with read numbers. Cultured isolates were most frequently identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, or Escherichia coli, with PFGE indicating high intraspecies diversity. Our findings highlight the importance of robust controls in studies of low microbial biomass samples and argue against meaningful bacterial colonization in utero. Given that meconium microbiome profiles could not be distinguished from sequencing controls, and that viable bacteria within meconium appeared uncommon and largely consistent with postnatal skin colonization, there does not appear to be a meconium microbiota. IMPORTANCE Much like the recent placental microbiome controversy, studies of neonatal meconium reporting bacterial communities within the fetal and neonatal gut imply that microbial colonization begins prior to birth. However, recent work has shown that placental microbiomes almost exclusively represent contamination from lab reagents and the environment. Here, we demonstrate that prior studies of neonatal meconium are impacted by the same issue, showing that the microbial content of meconium does not differ from negative controls that have never contained any biological material. Our culture findings similarly supported this notion and largely comprised bacteria normally associated with healthy skin. Overall, our work adds to the growing body of evidence against the in utero colonization hypothesis.",

			"abstract": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) 1 is considered an important respiratory pathogen, while the role of HBoV2-4 in clinical disease remains somewhat controversial. Since, they are characterized by a rapid evolution, worldwide surveillance of HBoVs' genetics is necessary. This study explored the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in pediatric patients with respiratory tract infection in Croatia and studied their phylogeny. Using multiplex PCR for 15 respiratory viruses, we investigated 957 respiratory samples of children up to 18 years of age with respiratory tract infection obtained from May 2017 to March 2021 at two different hospitals in Croatia. Amplification of HBoV near-complete genome or three overlapping fragments was performed, sequenced, and their phylogenetic inferences constructed. HBoV was detected in 7.6% children with a median age of 1.36 years. Co-infection was observed in 82.2% samples. Sequencing was successfully performed on 29 HBoV positive samples, and all belonged to HBoV1. Croatian HBoV1 sequences are closely related to strains isolated worldwide, and no phylogenetic grouping based on mono- or co-infection cases or year of isolation was observed. Calculated rates of evolution for HBoV1 were 10(-4) and 10(-5) substitutions per site and year. Recombination was not detected among sequences from this study.",

Here, we investigated the incidence of norovirus, genotypes circulation, and norovirus shedding in AGE stool samples from outpatients in Brazil. During a two-year period, 1546 AGE stool samples from ten Brazilian states were analyzed by RT-qPCR to detect and quantify GI and GII noroviruses. Positive samples were genotyped by dual sequencing using the ORF1/2 junction region. Overall, we detected norovirus in 32.1% of samples, with a massive predominance of GII viruses (89.1%). We also observed a significant difference between the median viral load of norovirus GI (3.4x10(5) GC/g of stool) and GII (1.9x10(7) GC/g). The most affected age group was children aged between 6 and 24 m old, and norovirus infection was detected throughout the year without marked seasonality. Phylogenetic analysis of partial RdRp and VP1 regions identified six and 11 genotype combinations of GI and GII, respectively. GII.4 Sydney[P16] was by far the predominant genotype (47.6%), followed by GII.2[P16], GII.4 Sydney[P31], and GII.6[P7]. We detected, for the first time in Brazil, the intergenogroup recombinant genotype GIX.1[GII.P15].

			"abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening gastrointestinal disorder afflicting preterm infants, which is currently unpreventable. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising preventive therapy, but the transfer of pathogenic microbes or toxic compounds raise concern. Removal of bacteria from donor feces by micropore filtering may reduce this risk of bacterial infection, while residual bacteriophages could maintain the NEC-preventive effects. We aimed to assess preclinical efficacy and safety of fecal filtrate transplantation (FFT). Using fecal material from healthy suckling piglets, we compared rectal FMT administration (FMT, n = 16) with cognate FFT by either rectal (FFTr, n = 14) or oro-gastric administration (FFTo, n = 13) and saline (CON, n = 16) in preterm, cesarean-delivered piglets as models for preterm infants. We assessed gut pathology and analyzed mucosal and luminal bacterial and viral composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and meta-virome sequencing. Finally, we used isolated ileal mucosa, coupled with RNA-Seq, to gauge the host response to the different treatments. Oro-gastric FFT completely prevented NEC, which was confirmed by microscopy, whereas FMT did not perform better than control. Oro-gastric FFT increased viral diversity and reduced Proteobacteria relative abundance in the ileal mucosa relative to control. An induction of mucosal immunity was observed in response to FMT but not FFT. As preterm infants are extremely vulnerable to infections, rational NEC-preventive strategies need incontestable safety profiles. We show in a clinically relevant animal model that FFT, as opposed to FMT, efficiently prevents NEC without any recognizable side effects.",

			"article_name": "Viability-Resolved Metagenomics Reveals Antagonistic Colonization Dynamics of Staphylococcus epidermidis Strains on Preterm Infant Skin.",
			"abstract": "Preterm infants are at increased risk of infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) that colonize skin. Technical barriers in sequencing low-microbial-biomass skin swabs from preterm infants hinder attempts to gain a strain-level understanding of CoNS colonization dynamics within their developing skin microbiome. Here, the microbiome of five skin sites and available stool was studied from four preterm infants hospitalized over their first 2 months of life. We used propidium monoazide treatment of samples to enrich for the viable microbiome and metagenomic shotgun sequencing to resolve species and strains. The microbiome of different skin sites overlapped with each other, was dominated by the CoNS species Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus capitis, and was distinct from stool. Species diversity on skin increased over time despite antibiotic exposure. Evidence of antagonism between the most common S. epidermidis strains, ST2 and ST59, included negative relationships for species correlation networks and in situ replication rates and that ST2 colonized skin earlier but was often replaced by ST59 over time. Experiments done with reference isolates showed that ST2 produced more biofilm than ST59 on plastic surfaces, which was reduced in mixed culture. We also discovered that a rare S. epidermidis strain, ST5, grew rapidly in stool in association with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia from a suspected episode of infection. Viability treatment of samples and moderate throughput shotgun sequencing provides strain-level information about CoNS colonization dynamics of preterm infant skin that ultimately might be exploited to prevent infections. IMPORTANCE The skin is a habitat for microbes that commonly infect preterm infants, but the use of sequencing for fine-scale study of the microbial communities of skin that develop in these infants has been limited by technical barriers. We treated skin swabs of preterm infants with a photoreactive dye that eliminates DNA from nonviable microbes and then sequenced the remaining DNA. We found that two strains of the most common species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, showed an antagonistic relationship on skin by cooccurring with different species, replicating fastest in different samples, and dominating skin sites at different times. Representatives of these strains also differed in their ability to stick to plastic surfaces-an important pathogenicity trait of this species. Our study shows the feasibility of gaining detailed information about strain colonization dynamics from this difficult-to-sequence body site of preterm infants, which might be used to guide novel approaches to prevent infections.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella oxytoca is a gastrointestinal pathobiont with the potential to produce the toxins tilivalline and tilimycin, which cause antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Overgrowth of toxigenic K oxytoca has recently been implicated in necrotizing enterocolitis. K oxytoca colonizes 2-9% of healthy adults, however, there is no systematic data on colonization in healthy children. We investigated K oxytoca colonization and its toxigenic properties in healthy infants. METHODS: We sampled stool of healthy infants and determined K oxytoca colonization using stool culture and PCR (pehX). Toxin in stool was measured with HPLC/high-resolution mass spectrometry. K oxytoca isolates were typed using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and K oxytoca toxin PCR (npsA/B). Cytotoxin production of isolates was analyzed by MTT assay. RESULTS: K oxytoca was detected in 30 of 61 infants (49%) using stool culture and in 45 of 61 (73%) using PCR (pehX). Toxin marker PCR (npsA/B) was positive in 66% of stool samples positive for K oxytoca PCR. Stool toxin levels were too low for quantitation but traces of tilivalline were detected. Contrarily, 49% of K oxytoca isolates demonstrated toxicity in the MTT assay. MLST revealed 36 distinct sequence types affiliated with all known K oxytoca sequence type clusters (A, B1 and B2). CONCLUSIONS: More than 70% of healthy infants were colonized with K oxytoca. Toxin quantities in stool of colonized healthy infants were below detection level, yet half of the isolates produced toxin in vitro demonstrating their pathobiont potential. The high occurrence of toxigenic K oxytoca in healthy infants has to be considered for future disease association studies.",

We aimed to assess whether enteral water-soluble vitamin A supplementation in extremely preterm infants decreases fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study nested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating enteral vitamin A (5,000 IU/day) for reducing the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely preterm infants. Fecal calprotectin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 28 days of Vitamin A or placebo supplementation. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin was measured in 66 infants (Vitamin A: 33, Placebo: 33). The mean (standard deviation) gestational age (25.5 [1.55] vs. 25.8 [1.48]; p = 0.341) (week), birth weight (810 [200] vs. 877 [251]; p = 0.240) (gram), and factors influencing fecal calprotectin levels were comparable between the vitamin A versus placebo group infants. All infants were exclusively fed with mother's or donor's human breast milk if mother's milk was unavailable using a standardized feeding regimen and received prophylactic probiotic supplementation. Fecal calprotectin levels (median; 25th-75th centiles) (micrograms/gram of feces) were not significantly different between vitamin A (152; 97-212) and placebo groups (179; 91-313) (p = 0.195). Two infants in the vitamin A group developed definite necrotizing enterocolitis compared to none in the placebo group. Incidence of BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was similar between the groups (vitamin A: 18/33, placebo: 13/33, p = 0.218). CONCLUSION: Enteral supplementation with water-soluble vitamin A did not affect fecal calprotectin levels in extremely preterm infants.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major challenge for premature infants in neonatal intensive care units and efforts toward the search for indicators that could be used to predict the development of the disease have given limited results until now. METHODS: In this study, stools from 132 very low birth weight infants were collected daily in the context of a multi-center prospective study aimed at investigating the potential of fecal biomarkers for NEC prediction. Eight infants (~6%) received a stage 3 NEC diagnosis. Their stools collected up to 10 days before diagnosis were included and matched with 14 non-NEC controls and tested by ELISA for the quantitation of eight biomarkers. RESULTS: Biomarkers were evaluated in all available stool samples leading to the identification of lipocalin-2 and calprotectin as the two most reliable predicting markers over the 10-day period prior to NEC development. Pooling the data for each infant confirmed the significance of lipocalin-2 and calprotectin, individually and in combination 1 week in advance of the NEC clinical diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The lipocalin-2 and calprotectin tandem represents a significant biomarker signature for predicting NEC development. Although not yet fulfilling the \"perfect biomarker\" criteria, it represents a first step toward it. IMPACT: Stool biomarkers can be used to predict NEC development in very low birth weight infants more than a week before the diagnosis. LCN2 was identified as a new robust biomarker for predicting NEC development, which used in conjunction with CALPRO, allows the identification of more than half of the cases that will develop NEC in very low birth weight infants. Combining more stool markers with the LCN2/CALPRO tandem such as PGE2 can further improve the algorithm for the prediction of NEC development.",

Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) treatment during pregnancy has been shown to protect mouse pups against allergic diseases. The maternal microbial metabolome during pregnancy may affect fetal allergic immune responses. We therefore examined the associations between CB CCL17 and gut SCFA levels in healthy pregnant Japanese women. CB CCL17 serum levels at birth, and maternal non-specific IgE levels in maternal sera at 32 weeks of gestation were measured. Maternal stool samples were collected at 12 (n = 59) and 32 (n = 58) weeks of gestation for gut microbiota analysis, based on barcoded 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolite levels. The CB CCL17 levels correlated negatively with butyrate concentrations and positively with isobutyrate at 12 weeks; CB CCL17 correlated positively with valerate and lactate at 32 weeks. Similarly, butyrate levels correlated negatively with maternal non-specific IgE levels, whereas the lactate concentration correlated positively with IgE levels. At 32 weeks, the Shannon diversity index (SDI) of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria correlated negatively with CB CCL17 levels, while those of the total microbiota correlated positively with the CB CCL17 levels. These metabolites may alter fetal immune responses. This study provides the first link between maternal metabolites during pregnancy and the risk of allergic diseases in human offspring.",

All three organisms are classified in the same species group but only B. infantis can metabolize human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). We compared HMO-metabolizing genes across different Bifidobacterium genomes and developed B. infantis-specific primers to determine if the genes alone or the primers can be used to quickly characterize B. infantis. We showed that B. infantis is uniquely identified by the presence of five HMO-metabolizing gene clusters, tested for its prevalence in infant gut metagenomes, and validated the results using the B. infantis-specific primers. We observed that only 15 of 203 (7.4%) children under 2 years old from a cohort of US children harbored B. infantis.

RESULTS: We examined infants and their treatments during and post-birth periods to examine potential transmission of colibactin-positive E. coli to infants. Here, analysis of fecal samples of infants over the first month of birth for the presence of a colibactin biosynthetic gene revealed that the bacterium may be transmitted from mother to infant through intimate contacts, such as natural childbirth and breastfeeding, but not through food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggests that transmission of colibactin-positive E. coli appears to be occurring at the very early stage of life of the newborn and hints at the possibility of developing early preventive measures against colorectal cancer.",

			"abstract": "Scope: Non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) such as native chicory inulin and 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) are added to infant formula to mimic some of the human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) functions. It is unknown whether combining inulin and 2'-FL influences their fermentation kinetics and whether the immune-modulatory effects of these NDCs are different under normal and inflammatory-prone Th2-polarizing conditions. Methods and results: We investigated the in vitro fermentation of 2'-FL and native chicory inulin, fermented individually and combined, using fecal inocula of 8-week-old infants. Native inulin was fermented in a size-dependent fashion and expedited the fermentation of 2'-FL. Fermentation of both native inulin and 2'FL increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, which coincided with the production of acetate and lactate. The fermentation digesta of all fermentations differentially influenced both dendritic cell and T-cell cytokine responses under normal culture conditions or in presence of the Th2-polarizing cytokines IL-33 and TSLP, with the most pronounced effect for IL-1beta in the presence of TSLP. Conclusions: Our findings show that native inulin can expedite the fermentation of 2'-FL by infant fecal microbiota and that these NDC fermentation digesta have different effects under normal and Th2-polarizing conditions, indicating that infants with different immune backgrounds might benefit from tailored NDC formulations.",

			"article_name": "Premature neonatal gut microbial community patterns supporting an epithelial TLR-mediated pathway for necrotizing enterocolitis.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating bowel disease, primarily affecting premature infants, with a poorly understood aetiology. Prior studies have found associations in different cases with an overabundance of particular elements of the faecal microbiota (in particular Enterobacteriaceae or Clostridium perfringens), but there has been no explanation for the different results found in different cohorts. Immunological studies have indicated that stimulation of the TLR4 receptor is involved in development of NEC, with TLR4 signalling being antagonised by the activated TLR9 receptor. We speculated that differential stimulation of these two components of the signalling pathway by different microbiota might explain the dichotomous findings of microbiota-centered NEC studies. Here we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and qPCR to characterise the faecal microbiota community of infants prior to NEC onset and in a set of matched controls. Bayesian regression was used to segregate cases from control samples using both microbial and clinical data. RESULTS: We found that the infants suffering from NEC fell into two groups based on their microbiota; one with low levels of CpG DNA in bacterial genomes and the other with high abundances of organisms expressing LPS. The identification of these characteristic communities was reproduced using an external metagenomic validation dataset. We propose that these two patterns represent the stimulation of a common pathway at extremes; the LPS-enriched microbiome suggesting overstimulation of TLR4, whilst a microbial community with low levels of CpG DNA suggests reduction of the counterbalance to TLR4 overstimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The identified microbial community patterns support the concept of NEC resulting from TLR-mediated pathways. Identification of these signals suggests characteristics of the gastrointestinal microbial community to be avoided to prevent NEC. Potential pre- or pro-biotic treatments may be designed to optimise TLR signalling.",

(2) Prenatal alcohol exposure was determined via maternal self-report during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (self-report+: n = 29) and the meconium alcohol metabolite Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG), collected at birth (>/=30 ng/g: n = 23). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to screen for prenatal maternal depressive symptoms during the 3rd trimester (>/=10: n = 35). Fifteen years later, 122 adolescents (M = 13.32 years; 48.4% female) provided blood samples for the analysis of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; M = 0.91; SD = 1.28). (3) Higher hsCRP levels were found in EtG positive adolescents (p = 0.036, etap(2) = 0.04) and an inverse non-significant dose-response relation with hsCRP (r = -0.35, p = 0.113). For maternal self-reported prenatal alcohol consumption (p = 0.780, etap(2) = 0.00) and prenatal depressive symptoms (p = 0.360, etap(2) = 0.01) no differences for hsCRP levels between the affected and unaffected groups were found. (4) Adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure are at risk for low-grade systemic inflammation. The EtG biomarker may be more accurate compared to self-reports. The findings suggest that prenatal maternal depression does not evoke low-grade systemic inflammation.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The human intestinal microbiome plays a central role in overall health status, especially in early life stages. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing is used to profile its taxonomic composition; however, multiomic approaches have been proposed as the most accurate methods for study of the complexity of the gut microbiota. In this study, we propose an optimized method for bacterial diversity analysis that we validated and complemented with metabolomics by analyzing fecal samples. METHODS: Forty-eight different analytical combinations regarding (1) 16S rRNA variable region sequencing, (2) a feature selection approach, and (3) taxonomy assignment methods were tested. A total of 18 infant fecal samples grouped depending on the type of feeding were analyzed by the proposed 16S rRNA workflow and by metabolomic analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the sole use of V4 region sequencing with ASV identification and VSEARCH for taxonomy assignment produced the most accurate results. The application of this workflow showed clear differences between fecal samples according to the type of feeding, which correlated with changes in the fecal metabolic profile. CONCLUSION: A multiomic approach using real fecal samples from 18 infants with different types of feeding demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed 16S rRNA-amplicon sequencing workflow.",

			"abstract": "The study aim was to examine possible correlates of convulsions in children hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Data collected in a prospective study of AGE hospitalizations in children aged 0-59 months in 3 hospitals in Israel during 2008-2015 were analyzed. Stool samples were tested for rotavirus using immunochromatography and stool culture was performed for the detection of Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter We compared clinical and demographic characteristics of children hospitalized for AGE who had convulsions (n = 68, cases) with children hospitalized for AGE without convulsions (n = 3505, controls). Age differed between children with and without convulsions (p = 0.005); the former were mostly toddlers aged 12-23 months (51%) compared to 30% of the control group. A higher percentage of cases tested positive for Shigella (11% vs. 4%, p = 0.002), the opposite was found for rotavirus (2% vs. 30% p < 0.001). A multivariable model showed that body temperature (OR 2.91 [95% CI 1.78-4.76], p < 0.001) and high blood glucose level (> 120 mg/dL) (OR 5.71 [95% CI 1.27-25.58] p = 0.023) were positively related to convulsions in children with AGE, while severe AGE (Vesikari score >/= 11) was inversely related with convulsions (OR 0.09 [95% CI 0.03-0.24], p < 0.001). Conclusion: Elevated body temperature is associated with convulsions in children with AGE, but not severity of AGE, while hyperglycemia might reflect a neuroendocrine stress reaction to convulsions, AGE or both.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the years, sanitation programs over the world have focused more on household sanitation, with limited attention towards the disposal of children's stools. This lack of attention could be due to the misconception that children's stools are harmless. The current study examined the individual and contextual predictors of safe disposal of children's faeces among women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). METHODS: The study used secondary data involving 128,096 mother-child pairs of under-five children from the current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in 15 sub-Saharan African countries from 2015 to 2018. Multilevel logistic analysis was used to assess the individual and contextual factors associated with the practice of safe disposal of children's faeces. We presented the results as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) at a statistical significance of p< 0.05. RESULTS: The results show that 58.73% (57.79-59.68) of childbearing women in the 15 countries in SSA included in our study safely disposed off their children's stools. This varied from as high as 85.90% (84.57-87.14) in Rwanda to as low as 26.38% (24.01-28.91) in Chad. At the individual level, the practice of safe disposal of children's stools was more likely to occur among children aged 1, compared to those aged 0 [aOR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.68-1.80] and those with diarrhoea compared to those without diarrhoea [aOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.13-1.21]. Mothers with primary level of education [aOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.30-1.5], those aged 35-39 [aOR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.12-1.28], and those exposed to radio [aOR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.20-1.27] were more likely to practice safe disposal of children's stools. Conversely, the odds of safe disposal of children's stool were lower among mothers who were married [aOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.69-0.80] and those who belonged to the Traditional African Religion [aOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51-0.80]. With the contextual factors, women with improved water [aOR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.10-1.16] and improved toilet facility [aOR = 5.75 95% CI: 5.55-5.95] had higher odds of safe disposal of children's stool. On the other hand, mothers who lived in households with 5 or more children [aOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93], those in rural areas [aOR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82-0.89], and those who lived in Central Africa [aOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.18-0.21] were less likely to practice safe disposal of children's stools. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that between- and within-country contextual variations and commonalities need to be acknowledged in designing interventions to enhance safe disposal of children's faeces. Audio-visual education on safe faecal disposal among rural women and large households can help enhance safe disposal. In light of the strong association between safe stool disposal and improved latrine use in SSA, governments need to develop feasible and cost-effective strategies to increase the number of households with access to improved toilet facilities.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiome in preterm infants differs markedly from term infants. It is unclear whether the microbiome develops over time according to infant specific factors. METHODS: We analysed (clinical) metadata - to identify the main factors influencing the microbiome composition development - and the first meconium and faecal samples til the 4th week via 16 S rRNA amplican sequencing. RESULTS: We included 41 infants (gestational age 25-30 weeks; birth weight 430-990 g. Birth via Caesarean section (CS) was associated with placental insufficiency during pregnancy and lower BW. In meconium samples and in samples from weeks 2 and 3 the abundance of Escherichia and Bacteroides (maternal faecal representatives) were associated with vaginal delivery while Staphylococcus (skin microbiome representative) was associated with CS. Secondly, irrespective of the week of sampling or the mode of birth, a transition was observed as children children gradually increased in weight from a microbiome dominated by Staphylococcus (Bacilli) towards a microbiome dominated by Enterobacteriaceae (Gammaproteobacteria). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the mode of delivery affects the meconium microbiome composition. They also suggest that the weight of the infant at the time of sampling is a better predictor for the stage of progression of the intestinal microbiome development/maturation than postconceptional age as it less confounded by various infant-specific factors.",

The use of these substances in women can occur at any stage of life, even in the childbearing age. Drug use during pregnancy presents significant risks for the mother and the fetus, so it is important to have tools that allow to detect prenatal exposure to these substances of abuse. Therefore, an analytical method for the determination of 137 NPS and other drugs of abuse in meconium by UHPLC-QTOF was developed and validated for semi-quantitative purpose. Linearity range, limit of detection (LOD), precision, matrix effect, selectivity, and specificity were evaluated. For all analytes, the calibration curves were studied in the ranges between 2, 10, or 50 ng/g and 750 or 1000 ng/g, (depending on the analyte) and the LOD ranged between 0.04 and 2.4 ng/g. The method was applied to 30 meconium specimens from cases in which fentanyl had been administered as epidural anesthesia at the time of delivery or cases in which the maternal hair was positive to other drug of abuse. Four meconium samples tested positive for fentanyl (range concentration = 440-750 ng/g) and two samples tested positive to acetylfentanyl (range concentration = 190-1400 ng/g).",

			"abstract": "Phthalates are chemicals suspected to adversely affect fetal neurodevelopment, but quantifying the fetal exposure is challenging. While prenatal phthalate exposure is commonly quantified in maternal urine, the newborn's meconium may better capture cumulative prenatal exposure. Currently, data on phthalates measured in meconium is sparse. We measured phthalate metabolites in 183 maternal second and 140 third trimester (T2, T3) urine, and in 190 meconium samples collected in an autism enriched-risk pregnancy cohort of 236 mothers. Eleven and eight metabolites were detected in over 90% of urine and meconium samples, respectively. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites were detected in both biosamples. Most urine phthalate metabolite distributions were similar between T2 and T3. Among metabolites detected in both biosamples, those of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate displayed a similar pattern in magnitude across metabolite type. Specifically, T2 creatinine adjusted distribution [median (25%, 75%)] of urine measured mono(2-ethylhexyl-carboxypentyl) (MECPP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) (MEHHP), and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) were 18.8(11.9, 31.4), 11.8(7.2, 19.1), and 8.9(6.2, 14.2) ng/mg. In meconium these were 16.6(10.9, 23.7), 2.5(1.5, 3.8), and 1.3(0.8, 2.3) ng/g, respectively. Metabolite-to-metabolite correlations were lower in meconium than urine, but patterns were similar. For example, correlation (95% CI) between mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and MECPP was 0.73 (0.66, 0.78), and between MEOHP and MEHHP was 0.96 (0.95, 0.97) in urine as compared to 0.10 (-0.04, 0.24) and 0.31 (0.18, 0.43) respectively in meconium. Correlations between same metabolites measured in urine and meconium were low and differed by metabolite and trimester. Correlation between MEHHP in urine and meconium, for example, was 0.20 (0.008, 0.37) at T3, but 0.05 (-0.12, 0.21) at T2. Our study provides evidence of general population-level prenatal phthalate exposure in a population at high risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and supports the utility of meconium to measure prenatal phthalate exposure but provides little evidence of correlation with exposure measured in prenatal maternal urine.",

Multiple (n = 152) stool samples were studied from 51 babies, all <32 weeks gestation.

Data were interpreted using Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution System (AMDIS) with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reference library. Statistical analysis was based on linear mixed modelling, the number of VOCs increased over time; a rise was mainly observed between day 5 and day 10. The shift at day 5 was associated with products of branched-chain fatty acids. Prior to this, the metabolome was dominated by aldehydes and acetic acid. Caesarean delivery showed a modest association with molecules of fungal origin. This study shows how the metabolome changes in early life in pre-term babies. The shift in the metabolome 5 days after delivery coincides with the establishment of enteral feeding and the transition from meconium to feces. Great diversity of metabolites was associated with being fed greater volumes of milk.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The compromised gut microbiome that results from C-section birth has been hypothesized as a risk factor for the development of non-communicable diseases (NCD). In a double-blind randomized controlled study, 153 infants born by elective C-section received an infant formula supplemented with either synbiotic, prebiotics, or unsupplemented from birth until 4 months old. Vaginally born infants were included as a reference group. Stool samples were collected from day 3 till week 22. Multi-omics were deployed to investigate the impact of mode of delivery and nutrition on the development of the infant gut microbiome, and uncover putative biological mechanisms underlying the role of a compromised microbiome as a risk factor for NCD. RESULTS: As early as day 3, infants born vaginally presented a hypoxic and acidic gut environment characterized by an enrichment of strict anaerobes (Bifidobacteriaceae). Infants born by C-section presented the hallmark of a compromised microbiome driven by an enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae. This was associated with meta-omics signatures characteristic of a microbiome adapted to a more oxygen-rich gut environment, enriched with genes associated with reactive oxygen species metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and depleted in genes involved in the metabolism of milk carbohydrates. The synbiotic formula modulated expression of microbial genes involved in (oligo)saccharide metabolism, which emulates the eco-physiological gut environment observed in vaginally born infants. The resulting hypoxic and acidic milieu prevented the establishment of a compromised microbiome. CONCLUSIONS: This study deciphers the putative functional hallmarks of a compromised microbiome acquired during C-section birth, and the impact of nutrition that may counteract disturbed microbiome development.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) affect one in ten and one in seven livebirths, respectively, primarily in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) and are major predictors of poor child health outcomes. However, both have been recalcitrant to public health intervention. The maternal intestinal microbiome may undergo substantial changes during pregnancy and may influence fetal and neonatal health in LMIC populations. METHODS: Within a subgroup of 207 mothers and infants enrolled in the SHINE trial in rural Zimbabwe, we performed shotgun metagenomics on 351 fecal specimens provided during pregnancy and at 1-month post-partum to investigate the relationship between the pregnancy gut microbiome and infant gestational age, birth weight, 1-month length-, and weight-for-age z-scores using extreme gradient boosting machines. FINDINGS: Pregnancy gut microbiome taxa and metabolic functions predicted birth weight and WAZ at 1 month more accurately than gestational age and LAZ. Blastoscystis sp, Brachyspira sp and Treponeme carriage were high compared to Western populations. Resistant starch-degraders were important predictors of birth outcomes. Microbiome capacity for environmental sensing, vitamin B metabolism, and signalling predicted increased infant birth weight and neonatal growth; while functions involved in biofilm formation in response to nutrient starvation predicted reduced birth weight and growth. INTERPRETATION: The pregnancy gut microbiome in rural Zimbabwe is characterized by resistant starch-degraders and may be an important metabolic target to improve birth weight.

			"abstract": "Human adenovirus-F (HAdV-F) (genotype 40/41) is the second-most leading cause of pediatric gastroenteritis after rotavirus, worldwide, accounting for 2.8%-11.8% of infantile diarrheal cases. Earlier studies across eastern India revealed a shift in the predominance of genotypes from HAdV41 in 2007-09 to HAdV40 in 2013-14. Thus, the surveillance for HAdV-F genotypes in this geographical setting was undertaken over 2017-2020 to analyze the viral evolutionary dynamics. A total of 3882 stool samples collected from children (</=5 years) were screened for HAdV-F positivity by conventional PCR. The hypervariable regions of the hexon and the partial shaft region of long fiber genes were amplified, sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed with respect to the prototype strains. A marginal decrease in enteric HAdV prevalence was observed (9.04%, n = 351/3882) compared to the previous report (11.8%) in this endemic setting. Children <2 years were found most vulnerable to enteric HAdV infection. Reduction in adenovirus-rotavirus co-infection was evident compared to the sole adenovirus infection. HAdV-F genotypes 40 and 41 were found to co-circulate, but HAdV41 was predominant. HAdV40 strains were genetically conserved, whereas HAdV41 strains accumulated new mutations. On the basis of a different set of mutations in their genome, HAdV41 strains segregated into 2 genome type clusters (GTCs). Circulating HAdV41 strains clustered with GTC1 of the fiber gene, for the first time during this study period. This study will provide much-needed baseline data on the emergence and circulation of HAdV40/41 strains for future vaccine development.",

			"abstract": "Microbiota maturation and immune development occur in parallel with, and are implicated in, allergic diseases, and research has begun to demonstrate the importance of prenatal influencers on both. Here, we investigate the meconium metabolome, a critical link between prenatal exposures and both early microbiota and immune development, to identify components of the neonatal gut niche that contribute to allergic sensitization. Our analysis reveals that newborns who develop immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic sensitization (atopy) by 1 year of age have a less-diverse gut metabolome at birth, and specific metabolic clusters are associated with both protection against atopy and the abundance of key taxa driving microbiota maturation. These metabolic signatures, when coupled with early-life microbiota and clinical factors, increase our ability to accurately predict whether or not infants will develop atopy. Thus, the trajectory of both microbiota colonization and immune development are significantly affected by metabolites present in the neonatal gut at birth.",

			"abstract": "Human sapovirus, which causes acute gastroenteritis, is not well studied and poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the contribution of sapovirus in diarrhea, their clinical association, and genotypic diversity. Fecal specimens (n = 871) were randomly selected from diarrheal patients who attended International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh during January 2012-December 2015 and tested for the presence of sapovirus RNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Sapovirus RNA was identified in 2.3% (n = 20) of the samples. Seventy-five percent of the sapovirus positive cases were coinfected with other pathogens, such as rotavirus, norovirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, adenovirus, Shigella spp., and Vibrio cholerae. A vast genetic diversity was observed among sapovirus with at least seven common genotypes (GI.1, GI.2, GI.7, GII.1, GII.4, GII.6, and GIV), and a new genotype GII.NA1. Some of the GI.1 strains detected were similar to GI.4 in the polymerase region sequence and were confirmed as recombinant strains. Our findings suggest that the overall contribution of sapovirus in hospitalized diarrheal illness is low but highlight enormous genetic diversity.",

In this observational study, preterm infants were recruited within the first 24 h after birth. Meconium and fecal samples were collected at four time points (between the 2nd and the 26th postnatal days. Fecal microbiota was analyzed by RT-PCR and by 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal ALP activity, a proposed specific biomarker of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), was evaluated by spectrophotometry at the 26th postnatal day. A total of 389 fecal samples were analyzed from 117 very preterm neonates. Human milk was positively associated with beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides ovatus, and Akkermancia muciniphila, as well as bacterial richness. Neonates fed with human milk during the first week of life had increased Bifidobacterium content and fecal ALP activity on the 26th postnatal day. These findings point out the importance of MOM and DHM in the establishment of fecal microbiota on neonates prematurely delivered. Moreover, these results suggest an ALP pathway by which human milk may protect against NEC.",

			"abstract": "SCOPE: Next to galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), starch-derived isomalto-oligosaccharide preparation (IMO) and isomalto/malto-polysaccharides (IMMP) could potentially be used as prebiotics in infant formulas. However, it remains largely unknown how the specific molecular structures of these non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) impact fermentability and immune responses in infants. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro fermentation of GOS, IMO and IMMP using infant fecal inoculum of 2- and 8-week-old infants shows that only GOS and IMO are fermented by infant fecal microbiota. The degradation of GOS and IMO coincides with an increase in Bifidobacterium and production of acetate and lactate, which is more pronounced with GOS. Individual isomers with an (1<-->1)-linkage or di-substituted reducing terminal glucose residue are more resistant to fermentation. GOS, IMO, and IMMP fermentation digesta attenuates cytokine profiles in immature dendritic cells (DCs), but the extent is dependent on the infants age and NDC structure. CONCLUSION: The IMO preparation, containing reducing and non-reducing isomers, shows similar fermentation patterns as GOS in fecal microbiota of 2-week-old infants. Knowledge obtained on the substrate specificities of infant fecal microbiota and the subsequent regulatory effects of GOS, IMO and IMMP on DC responses might contribute to the design of tailored NDC mixtures for infants of different age groups.",

The relationship between GDM and meconium microbiota and metabolome remains incompletely understood. METHODS: Four hundred eighteen mothers (147 women with GDM and 271 normal pregnant women) and their neonates from the GDM Mother and Child Study were included in this study. Meconium microbiota were profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Meconium and maternal serum metabolome were examined by UPLC-QE. RESULTS: Microbial communities in meconium were significantly altered in neonates from the GDM mothers. A reduction in alpha diversity was observed in neonates of GDM mothers. At the phylum level, the abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria changed significantly in neonates of GDM mothers. Metabolomic analysis of meconium showed that metabolic pathways including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis were altered in GDM subjects. Several changed metabolites varying by the similar trend across the maternal serum and neonatal meconium were observed. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these findings suggest that GDM could alter the serum metabolome and is associated with the neonatal meconium microbiota and metabolome, highlighting the importance of maternal factors on early-life metabolism.",

Our study took place in the Jawadhu Hills, which is a tribal region in Tamil Nadu, India. Using a One Health approach, we included animal and environmental samples and human risk factors to answer questions about the associations among infected household soil, domestic animals, and human risk factors. Helminth eggs were identified by microscopy in animal and soil samples, and a survey about risk factors was administered to the head of the household. Contact with animals was reported in 71% of households. High levels of helminth infections were found across domestic animal species, especially in goats, chickens, and dogs. Helminth eggs were recorded in 44% of household soil (n = 43/97) and separately in 88% of soil near a water source (n = 28/32). Animal contact was associated with 4.05 higher odds of having helminth eggs in the household soil (P = 0.01), and also having a water source at the household was associated with a 0.33 lower odds of having helminth eggs in the household soil (P = 0.04). Soil moisture was a mediator of this association with a significant indirect effect (P < 0.001). The proportion mediated was 0.50. While our work does not examine transmission, these results support consideration of animal-associated exposure to STH and potentially zoonotic helminths in future interventions to reduce helminth burden. Our study provides support for further investigation of the effects of animals and animal fecal matter on human health.",

			"abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus can colonize both the anterior nares and the gastrointestinal tract. However, colonization at these sites in the same individuals has not been studied, and the traits that facilitate colonization and persistence at these sites have not been compared. Samples from the nostrils and feces collected on 9 occasions from 3 days to 3 years of age in 65 infants were cultured; 54 samples yielded S. aureus. The numbers of nasal and fecal S. aureus strains increased rapidly during the first weeks and were similar at 1 month of age (>40% of infants colonized). Thereafter, nasal carriage declined, while fecal carriage remained high during the first year of life. Individual strains were identified, and their colonization patterns were related to their carriage of genes encoding adhesins and superantigenic toxins. Strains retrieved from both the nose and gut (n = 44) of an infant were 4.5 times more likely to colonize long term (>/=3 weeks at both sites) than strains found only in the rectum/feces (n = 56) or only in the nose (n = 32) (P </= 0.001). Gut colonization was significantly associated with carriage of the fnbA gene, and long-term colonization at either site was associated with carriage of fnbA and fnbB. In summary, gut colonization by S. aureus was more common than nasal carriage by S. aureus in the studied infants. Gut strains may provide a reservoir for invasive disease in vulnerable individuals. Fibronectin-binding adhesins and other virulence factors may facilitate commensal colonization and confer pathogenic potential. IMPORTANCE S. aureus may cause severe infections and frequently colonizes the nose. Nasal carriage of S. aureus increases 3-fold the risk of invasive S. aureus infection. S. aureus is also commonly found in the gut microbiota of infants and young children. However, the relationships between the adhesins and other virulence factors of S. aureus strains and its abilities to colonize the nostrils and gut of infants are not well understood. Our study explores the simultaneous colonization by S. aureus of the nasal and intestinal tracts of newborn infants through 3 years of follow-up. We identify bacterial virulence traits that appear to facilitate persistent colonization of the nose and gut by S. aureus. This expands our current knowledge of the interplay between bacterial commensalism and pathogenicity. Moreover, it may contribute to the development of targeted strategies for combating S. aureus infection.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Madeira River (Amazon Basin) has been impacted by activities related to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), deforestation and burning (for timber, agriculture, and hydroelectric dam projects). All these activities contribute to environmental mercury (Hg) release and cycling into the Amazon ecosystem and thus to changing lifestyles. METHOD: We assessed exposure to total and MeHg in two small riverine communities of the Madeira River (Amazon): Lago Puruzinho (LP, n\u202f=\u202f26 families) and Sao Sebastiao do Tapuru (SST, n\u202f=\u202f31 families). Samples of human hair (n\u202f=\u202f137), blood (n\u202f=\u202f39), and feces (n\u202f=\u202f41) were collected from adults and children (0-15 years of age). RESULTS: In women of childbearing age from LP village, the mean blood total-Hg (THg) (45.54\u202f+/-\u202f24.76\u202fmug.L(-1)) and MeHg (10.79\u202f+/-\u202f4.36\u202fmug.L(-1)) concentrations were significantly (p\u202f=\u202f0.0024; p\u202f<\u202f0.0001, respectively) higher than in women from SST village (THg: 25.32\u202f+/-\u202f16.75\u202fmug.L(-1); MeHg: 2.32\u202f+/-\u202f1.56\u202fmug.L(-1)) village; the trend in hair-Hg persisted but was statistically significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.0145) only for THg (LP, 11.34\u202f+/-\u202f5.03 mug.\u202fg(-1); SST, 7.97\u202f+/-\u202f3.51 mug.\u202fg(-1)). In women, the median hair:blood ratio of total Hg was 269. In children, the mean hair THg concentrations were 6.07\u202f+/-\u202f3.60 mug.\u202fg(-1) and 6.47\u202f+/-\u202f4.16 mug.\u202fg(-1) in LP and SST; thus, not significantly different (p\u202f=\u202f0.8006). There was a significant association (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) between hair-Hg concentrations of mothers and their respective children. The excretion of Hg in feces of women (0.52 mug.\u202fg(-1) dw) was not significantly different from children (0.49 mug.\u202fg(-1) dw). The only statistically significant correlation between Hg in feces and in hair was found in children, (n\u202f=\u202f16, r(s)\u202f=\u202f0.38, p\u202f=\u202f0.005). Significant relationship was seen between the levels of THg in blood and hair of women from LP and SST. Based on hair-Hg concentrations, fish consumption rate ranged from 94.5 to 212.3\u202fg.day(-1). CONCLUSION: Women and children excrete THg in feces in comparable concentrations. However, the mean fish consumption rate and blood MeHg are higher in the most remote villagers. Mother;s hair-Hg concentration is a good predictor of children's hair-Hg.",

The immunoaffinity assays are routinely applied to quantify circulating immune protein markers in blood/serum. However, a reliable, multiplex assay to quantify fecal levels of immune proteins is unavailable. We developed mass spectrometry assays to simultaneously quantify fecal calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophil cationic protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin 1, and adaptive immunity effectors in 134 neonatal stool swabs. We optimized extraction and proteolytic protocol and validated the multiplex assay in terms of linearity of response (> 100; typically 0.04 to 14.77 microg/mg of total protein), coefficient of determination (R(2); > 0.99), the limit of detection (LOD; 0.003 to 0.04 microg/mg of total protein), the limit of quantification (LOQ; 0.009 to 0.122 microg/mg of total protein) and robustness. The median CV of intra- and interday precision was 9.8% and 14.1%, respectively. We quantified breast milk-derived IGHA2 to differentiate meconium from feces samples and to detect the first food intake. An early life profiling of immune markers reflects disrupted intestinal homeostasis, and it is perhaps suitable for pre-symptomatic interception of IBD and food allergies.",

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test whether microbial quorum sensing (QS) affects LBW-induced intestinal developmental defects in piglets. METHODS: Seven normal-birth-weight (NBW; 1.36 +/- 0.01 kg) and 7 LBW (0.89 +/- 0.01 kg) piglets were selected. Feces were collected from piglets on 2, 21, and 50 days of age for detection of the QS signaling molecules, N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and microbiota analysis. The associations between 2 long-chain AHLs [N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) and N-3-oxo-tetradecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3OC14-HSL)] and the microbes were tested using Spearman correlation coefficients. The effect of 3OC12-HSL and 3OC14-HSL on intestinal porcine epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell viability was investigated by cholecystokinin octapeptide assay. Transcriptomic analysis was performed by RNA sequencing on cells treated with 3OC12-HSL. RESULTS: The concentrations of 3OC12-HSL and 3OC14-HSL in the feces of LBW piglets were higher than those in NBW piglets at age 50 d by 2.5- and 2.24-fold, respectively (P < 0.05). The microbial alpha diversity (observed species, abundance-based coverage estimator, and Shannon index) of LBW piglets was 81-91% lower than that of NBW piglets (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG-002/UCG-013 was 43.0% and 30.0% lower, respectively, in feces from LBW compared with NBW piglets (P < 0.05). 3OC12-HSL and Ruminococcaceae UCG-002/UCG-005/UCG-010 abundance were negatively correlated (rho  </=  -0.58). Treatment with 400 muM 3OC12-HSL markedly reduced IPEC-J2 cell viability by 47.5%. Transcriptomic data showed that 3OC12-HSL mainly changed the \"import across plasma membrane\" and \"arginine and proline metabolism\" of IPEC-J2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: 3OC12-HSL is a QS signaling molecule with an ability to impair gut health of LBW piglets. This finding adds to our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for gut injury in LBW piglets.",

This study was aimed at detecting the prevalence of RVA in Pakistan after rotavirus vaccines were introduced. Fecal samples were obtained from 813 children from different hospitals in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan, from January 2018 to December 2018. To obtain additional information from the parents / guardians of the children, a standard questionnaire was used. RESULTS: Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA), rotavirus antigen was detected and ELISA positive samples were subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The findings showed 22% prevalence of RVA in children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) via ELISA and 21% prevalence via RT-PCR in children with AGE. There was no statistically significant difference between gender, age and RVA infections. The winter, spring and fall/autumn seasons were statistically significant for RVA prevalence. CONCLUSION: The present study will provide post vaccine prevalence data for the health policy makers. The implementation of rotavirus vaccines, along with adequate nutrition for babies, clean water supply and maternal hygienic activities during infant feeding, is recommended. Furthermore, continuous surveillance is mandatory in the whole country to calculate the disease burden caused by RVA.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Typhoid incidence in children is higher in urban areas than in rural areas of Bangladesh. This study examined whether healthy urban children harboured higher levels of Salmonella genes than healthy rural children. METHODOLOGY: Stool samples from 140 children were studied: 70 from rural areas and 70 from urban metropolitan areas. RESULTS: The stool samples of urban children contained more Salmonella genes (median 4, IQR 3-4) than those of rural children (median 3, IQR 3-4). This suggests that urban Bangladeshi children have more Salmonella genes in their guts than rural children. Especially, in those under 12 months of age, the Salmonella gene prevalence in urban children was unique. They had more Salmonella genes (median 4, IQR 4-5) than rural children in the same age group (median 3, IQR 2.5-4). We also found more Salmonella genes in urban children who drank tap water (median 4, IQR 3-5) than in rural children whose water source was tube well water (median 3, IQR 2-4) and boiled pond water (median 3, IQR 3-3.5). However, there was no significant difference of Salmonella genes between urban children who drank tap-water and children whose water source was a tube well (median 4, IQR 3-4). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the urban environment, including the drinking water supply system, increases the likelihood of healthy children in urban areas harbouring more potentially pathogenic Salmonella organisms in their gut than found in rural healthy children.",

Aberrant gut colonization in early life may predispose children to various diseases in adulthood. However, the associations between gut microbial changes and GBS colonization is still unclear. RESULTS: The composition and diversity of meconium microbiota in GBS group were similar to that of healthy controls. However, we identified several specific taxa that were differentially abundant between the two groups (linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe): p < 0.05, LDA > 2.0). Particularly, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus paracasei was significantly reduced, indicating a role in GBS colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented a series of bacterial species colonized by GBS, thus providing novel evidence in support of initial intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in the neonates with mother's GBS colonization.",

			"abstract": "Human milk glycans present a unique diversity of structures that suggest different mechanisms by which they may affect the infant microbiome development. A humanized mouse model generated by infant fecal transplantation was utilized here to evaluate the impact of fucosyl-alpha1,3-GlcNAc (3FN), fucosyl-alpha1,6-GlcNAc, lacto-N-biose (LNB) and galacto-N-biose on the fecal microbiota and host-microbiota interactions. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing showed that certain bacterial genera significantly increased (Ruminococcus and Oscillospira) or decreased (Eubacterium and Clostridium) in all disaccharide-supplemented groups. Interestingly, cluster analysis differentiates the consumption of fucosyl-oligosaccharides from galactosyl-oligosaccharides, highlighting the disappearance of Akkermansia genus in both fucosyl-oligosaccharides. An increment of the relative abundance of Coprococcus genus was only observed with 3FN. As well, LNB significantly increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, whereas the absolute levels of this genus, as measured by quantitative real-time PCR, did not significantly increase. OTUs corresponding to the species Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Ruminococcus gnavus were not present in the control after the 3-week intervention, but were shared among the donor and specific disaccharide groups, indicating that their survival is dependent on disaccharide supplementation. The 3FN-feeding group showed increased levels of butyrate and acetate in the colon, and decreased levels of serum HDL-cholesterol. 3FN also down-regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and up-regulated the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-13, and the Toll-like receptor 2 in the large intestine tissue. The present study revealed that the four disaccharides show efficacy in producing beneficial compositional shifts of the gut microbiota and in addition, the 3FN demonstrated physiological and immunomodulatory roles.",

In a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, n = 160 healthy term infants under 4 months of age were randomized to receive either an infant formula enriched with 0.8 g/dL of Orafti((R))Synergy1 or an unsupplemented control formula until the age of 12 months. Growth, fever (>38  degrees C) and infections were regularly followed up by a pediatrician. Digestive symptoms, stool consistency as well as crying and sleeping patterns were recorded during one week each study month. Fecal microbiota and immunological biomarkers were determined from a subgroup of infants after 2, 6 and 12 months of life. The intention to treat (ITT) population consisted of n = 149 infants. Both formulae were well tolerated. Mean duration of infections was significantly lower in the prebiotic fed infants (p < 0.05). The prebiotic group showed higher Bifidobacterium counts at month 6 (p = 0.006), and higher proportions of Bifidobacterium in relation to total bacteria at month 2 and 6 (p = 0.042 and p = 0.013, respectively). Stools of infants receiving the prebiotic formula were softer (p < 0.05). Orafti((R))Synergy1 tended to beneficially impact total daily amount of crying (p = 0.0594). Supplementation with inulin-type prebiotic oligosaccharides during the first year of life beneficially modulates the infant gut microbiota towards higher Bifidobacterium levels at the first 6 months of life, and is associated with reduced duration of infections.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unsafe disposal of children's stool makes children susceptible to fecal-oral diseases and children remain vulnerable till the stools of all children are disposed of safely. There is a paucity of data on spatial distribution and factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal in Ethiopia. Previous estimates, however, do not include information regarding individual and community-level factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal. Hence, the current study aimed (i) to explore the spatial distribution and (ii) to identify factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal in Ethiopia. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the recent 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. A total of 4145 children aged 0-23 months with their mother were included in this analysis. The Getis-Ord spatial statistical tool was used to identify high and low hotspots areas of unsafe child stool disposal. The Bernoulli model was applied using Kilduff SaTScan version 9.6 software to identify significant spatial clusters. A multilevel multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal. RESULTS: Unsafe child stool disposal was spatially clustered in Ethiopia (Moran's Index = 0.211, p-value< 0.0001), and significant spatial SaTScan clusters of areas with a high rate of unsafe child stool disposal were detected. The most likely primary SaTScan cluster was detected in Tigray, Amhara, Afar (north), and Benishangul-Gumuz (north) regions (LLR: 41.62, p<0.0001). Unsafe child stool disposal is more prevalent among households that had unimproved toilet facility (AOR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.17-2.02) and those with high community poorer level (AOR: 1.74, 95%CI: 1.23-2.46). Higher prevalence of unsafe child stool disposal was also found in households with poor wealth quintiles. Children belong to agrarian regions (AOR: 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.91), children 6-11 months of age (AOR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.52-0.83), 12-17 months of age (AOR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.54-0.86), and 18-23 months of age (AOR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.45-0.75) had lower odds of unsafe child stool disposal. CONCLUSIONS: Unsafe child stool disposal was spatially clustered. Higher odds of unsafe child stool disposal were found in households with high community poverty level, poor, unimproved toilet facility, and with the youngest children. Hence, the health authorities could tailor effective child stool management programs to mitigate the inequalities identified in this study. It is also better to consider child stool management intervention in existing sanitation activities considering the identified factors.",

This study aims to clarify the optimum therapeutic strategy for MRI in VLBWs. METHODS: MRI was defined as delayed meconium excretion and microcolon on contrast enema with Gastrografin (diatrizoate acid). Forty-two infants with MRI were treated at our institution between 2009 and 2019, and are reviewed here. They were classified into two groups: in group A (n=21), Gastrografin regurgitated into the dilated intestine during the first or second round of Gastrografin enema (GaE), while in group B (N = 21), Gastrografin did not regurgitate. Laparotomy was indicated if the intestine was perforated, or if abdominal distention was not relieved by two rounds of GaE. RESULTS: in group A, meconium was excreted in all cases within 24 h after GaE, and no cases required laparotomy. In group B, twelve cases (57%) underwent laparotomy (P < 0.01), six cases in this group (29%), showed free air on X-ray images (P < 0.01). The median hospital stay in groups A and B were 89.0 and 136.5 days, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall mortality was 2.4%. CONCLUSIONS: early therapeutic diagnosis by GaE followed by early surgery is suggested as the optimum strategy for MRI in VLBWs.",

In a cohort of 662 Danish children, we characterized the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) acquired during the first year of life and assessed the impacts of diverse environmental exposures on ARG load. Our study reveals a clear bimodal distribution of ARG richness that is driven by the composition of the gut microbiome, especially E. coli. ARG profiles were significantly affected by various environmental factors. Among these factors, the importance of antibiotics diminished with time since treatment. Finally, ARG load and ARG clusters were also associated with the maturity of the gut microbiome and a bacterial composition associated with increased risk of asthma. These findings broaden our understanding of AMR in early life and have critical implications for efforts to mitigate its spread.",

We found that levels of serum EndoCab and sCD14 increase with the cumulative incidence of enteric infections. We observed a significant correlation between the fecal MPO level in the children at 24 months of age with the total number of bacterial and viral infections, the total number of parasitic infections, and the total number of diarrheal episodes and diarrheal duration. We observed that the levels of serum EndoCab, sCD14, and fecal MPO at 3 months of age were significantly associated with whether children were malnourished at 18 months of age or not. Biomarkers such as fecal MPO, serum EndoCab and sCD14 in children at an early age may be useful as a measure of cumulative burden of preceding enteric infections, which are predictive of subsequent malnutrition status and may be useful non-invasive biomarkers for EE.",

Research has shown differing microbial composition based on geographic location, providing evidence that diverse biospecimen data is needed when studying human bacterial communities. Yet, limited research describes human milk and infant gut microbial communities in Africa. Our study uses breastmilk, stool, and meconium samples from a South African birth cohort to describe the microbial diversity, identify distinct taxonomic units, and determine correlations between bacterial abundance in breastmilk and stool samples. Mother-infant dyads (N = 20) were identified from a longitudinal birth cohort in the Vhembe district of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Breastmilk, meconium, and stool samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of the V4-V5 gene region using the MiSeq platform for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. A non-metric multidimensional scaling using Bray-Curtis distances of sample Z-scores showed that meconium, stool, and breastmilk microbial communities are distinct with varying genus. Breastmilk was mostly comprised of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Veillonella, and Corynebacterium. Stool samples showed the highest levels of Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, and Streptococcus. Alpha diversity measures found that stool samples have the highest Shannon index score compared to breastmilk and meconium. The abundance of Bifidobacterium (r = 0.57), Blautia (r = 0.59), and Haemophilus (r = 0.69) was correlated (p < 0.1) between breastmilk and stool samples.

To provide new insights into these issues, we sampled the gut microbiome of young children with and without acute diarrheal disease (ADD) living in rural and urban areas in northern Ecuador. Shotgun metagenomic analyses of non-ADD samples revealed small but significant differences in the abundance of microbial taxa, including a greater abundance of Prevotella and a lower abundance of Bacteroides and Alistipes in rural populations. Greater and more significant shifts in taxon abundance, metabolic pathway abundance, and diversity were observed between ADD and non-ADD status when comparing urban to rural sites (Welch's t-test, P < 0.05).

Meconium is a unique matrix to perform prenatal studies because it enables us to retrospectively evaluate fetal exposure accumulated during the second and third trimester. The aim of the present study was to evaluate associations between organic pollutant levels in meconium and birth weight in NW Spain. METHODS: In this study, we quantify the concentrations of 50 organic pollutants together with the total values of the most important chemical groups in meconium using gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers were detected with the highest levels in meconium from small for gestational age newborns. It was estimated that several congeners were statistically significant (p<0.05). However, organophosphorus pesticides attained higher concentrations in newborns with an appropriate weight. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of transplacental transfer can be confirmed. Prenatal exposure to organic pollutants was associated with a decrease in birth weight and, therefore, organic pollutants could have an impact on fetal growth. Nevertheless, these results need validation in larger sample sized studies.",

			"abstract": "In this work, we determined the diversity and dynamics of the gut virome of infants during the first year of life. Fecal samples were collected monthly, from birth to one year of age, from three healthy children living in a semi-rural village in Mexico. Most of the viral reads were classified into six families of bacteriophages including five dsDNA virus families of the order Caudovirales, with Siphoviridae and Podoviridae being the most abundant. Eukaryotic viruses were detected as early as two weeks after birth and remained present all along the first year of life. Thirty-four different eukaryotic virus families were found, where eight of these families accounted for 98% of all eukaryotic viral reads: Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Genomoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and the plant-infecting viruses of the Virgaviridae family. Some viruses in these families are known human pathogens, and it is surprising that they were found during the first year of life in infants without gastrointestinal symptoms. The eukaryotic virus species richness found in this work was higher than that observed in previous studies; on average between 7 and 24 virus species were identified per sample. The richness and abundance of the eukaryotic virome significantly increased during the second semester of life, probably because of an increased environmental exposure of infants with age. Our findings suggest an early and permanent contact of infants with a diverse array of bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, whose composition changes over time. The bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses found in these children could represent a metastable virome, whose potential influence on the development of the infant's immune system or on the health of the infants later in life, remains to be investigated.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early life gut microbiota is involved in several biological processes, particularly metabolism, immunity, and cognitive neurodevelopment. Perturbation in the infant's gut microbiota increases the risk for diseases in early and later life, highlighting the importance of understanding the connections between perinatal factors with early life microbial composition. The present research paper is aimed at exploring the prenatal and postnatal factors influencing the infant gut microbiota composition at six months of age. METHODS: Gut microbiota of infants enrolled in the longitudinal, prospective, observational study \"A.MA.MI\" (Alimentazione MAmma e bambino nei primi MIlle giorni) was analyzed. We collected and analyzed 61 fecal samples at baseline (meconium, T0); at six months of age (T2), we collected and analyzed 53 fecal samples. Samples were grouped based on maternal and gestational weight factors, type of delivery, type of feeding, time of weaning, and presence/absence of older siblings. Alpha and beta diversities were evaluated to describe microbiota composition. Multivariate analyses were performed to understand the impact of the aforementioned factors on the infant's microbiota composition at six months of age. RESULTS: Different clustering hypotheses have been tested to evaluate the impact of known metadata factors on the infant microbiota. Neither maternal body mass index nor gestational weight gain was able to determine significant differences in infant microbiota composition six months of age. Concerning the type of feeding, we observed a low alpha diversity in exclusive breastfed infants; conversely, non-exclusively breastfed infants reported an overgrowth of Ruminococcaceae and Flavonifractor. Furthermore, we did not find any statistically significant difference resulting from an early introduction of solid foods (before 4 months of age). Lastly, our sample showed a higher abundance of clostridial patterns in firstborn babies when compared to infants with older siblings in the family. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that, at this stage of life, there is not a single factor able to affect in a distinct way the infants' gut microbiota development. Rather, there seems to be a complex multifactorial interaction between maternal and neonatal factors determining a unique microbial niche in the gastrointestinal tract.",

			"abstract": "Human astrovirus (HAstV) is one of the most common causative agents of acute gastroenteritis in children with an infection rate estimated to range from 2% to 9% worldwide. This study was aimed at investigating the molecular and clinical epidemiological features of human astrovirus infections in children under 5 years old with acute gastroenteritis in Shandong province, China from July 2017 to June 2018. In total, 376 fecal samples and the corresponding clinical information were collected and analyzed. HAstV infections were detected in all age groups with an overall positive rate of 8.51%. In addition to acute diarrhea, the main clinical manifestations were fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, and dehydration, in which fever was the most common complication. Infections could be seen throughout the year with a peak in the colder season. Four genotypes were detected in which HAstV-1 was the most prevalent genotype with a prevalence of 78.12%, followed by HAstV-5 (9.38%), MLB-1 (9.38%), and MLB-2 (3.12%). HAstV-1 strains were classified as lineage 1a, 1b, and 1d, in which lineage 1a strains were the most prevalent followed by lineage 1b and lineage 1d strains. All HAstV-5 strains were classified as lineage 5b and no other lineages were detected. The results showed that HAstV infection was an important cause of acute gastroenteritis among children under 5 years old in Shandong province. Given that their disease spectrum had been broadened, HAstVs should be paid more attention, not only as a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis but also as a potential pathogen of unexpected diseases.",

			"abstract": "Environmental factors, including nutritional habits or birth mode, are known key determinants for intestinal microbial composition. Investigations of the intestinal microbiome in different species in a multiplicity of studies during recent decades have revealed differential microbial patterns and quantities along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Characterization of the microbial pattern in various aspects is a prerequisite for nutritional interventions. In this 16S rRNA amplicon-based approach, we present a characterization of the mucosa-associated microbiome in comparison with the luminal community of four infants at the time of the closure of ileostomies and perform a systematic characterization of the corresponding luminal and mucosal microbiome from jejunal, ileal and colonic regions, as well as collected feces in mice. The most dominant taxa in infant-derived samples altered due to individual differences, and in the mucosa, Enterococcus, Clostridiumsensustricto1, Veillonella, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were the most abundant. Two less abundant taxa differed significantly between the mucosa and lumen. In murine samples, relative abundances differed significantly, mainly between the intestinal regions. Significant differences between mouse mucosa- and lumen-derived samples could be found in the observed species with a trend to lower estimated diversity in mucosa-derived samples, as well as in the relative abundance of individual taxa. In this study, we examined the difference between the mucosal and luminal bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract in a small sample cohort of preterm infants. Individual differences were characterized and statistical significance was reached in two taxa (Cupriavidus, Ralstonia). The corresponding study on the different murine intestinal regions along the GI tract showed differences all over the intestinal region.",

			"abstract": "The establishment of the gut microbiota poses implications for short and long-term health. Bifidobacterium is an important taxon in early life, being one of the most abundant genera in the infant intestinal microbiota and carrying out key functions for maintaining host-homeostasis. Recent metagenomic studies have shown that different factors, such as gestational age, delivery mode, or feeding habits, affect the gut microbiota establishment at high phylogenetic levels. However, their impact on the specific bifidobacterial populations is not yet well understood. Here we studied the impact of these factors on the different Bifidobacterium species and subspecies at both the quantitative and qualitative levels. Fecal samples were taken from 85 neonates at 2, 10, 30, 90 days of life, and the relative proportions of the different bifidobacterial populations were assessed by 16S rRNA-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing. Absolute levels of the main species were determined by q-PCR. Our results showed that the bifidobacterial population establishment is affected by gestational age, delivery mode, and infant feeding, as it is evidenced by qualitative and quantitative changes. These data underline the need for understanding the impact of perinatal factors on the gut microbiota also at low taxonomic levels, especially in the case of relevant microbial populations such as Bifidobacterium. The data obtained provide indications for the selection of the species best suited for the development of bifidobacteria-based products for different groups of neonates and will help to develop rational strategies for favoring a healthy early microbiota development when this process is challenged.",

Identifying viral agents and understanding their genetic diversity could help to develop effective preventive measures. This study aimed to determine the detection rate and genetic diversity of four enteric viruses in Gabonese children aged below five years. Stool samples from children <5 years with (n = 177) and without (n = 67) diarrhea were collected from April 2018 to November 2019. Norovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, and aichivirus A were identified using PCR techniques followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. At least one viral agent was identified in 23.2% and 14.9% of the symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, respectively. Norovirus (14.7%) and astrovirus (7.3%) were the most prevalent in children with diarrhea, whereas in the healthy group norovirus (9%) followed by the first reported aichivirus A in Gabon (6%) were predominant. The predominant norovirus genogroup was GII, consisting mostly of genotype GII.P31-GII.4 Sydney. Phylogenetic analysis of the 3CD region of the aichivirus A genome revealed the presence of two genotypes (A and C) in the study cohort. Astrovirus and sapovirus showed a high diversity, with five different astrovirus genotypes and four sapovirus genotypes, respectively.

			"abstract": "Breastfeeding is the gold standard for feeding infants because of its long-term benefits to health and development, but most infants in the United States are not exclusively breastfed in the first six months. We enrolled 24 infants who were either exclusively breastfed or supplemented with formula by the age of one month. We collected diet information, stool samples for evaluation of microbiotas by 16S rRNA sequencing, and blood samples for assessment of immune development by flow cytometry from birth to 6 months of age. We further typed the Bifidobacterium strains in stool samples whose 16S rRNA sequencing showed the presence of Bifidobacteriaceae. Supplementation with formula during breastfeeding transiently changed the composition of the gut microbiome, but the impact dissipated by six months of age. For example, Bifidobacterium longum, a bacterial species highly correlated with human milk consumption, was found to be significantly different only at 1 month of age but not at later time points. No immunologic differences were found to be associated with supplementation, including the development of T-cell subsets, B cells, or monocytes. These data suggest that early formula supplementation, given in addition to breast milk, has minimal lasting impact on the gut microbiome or immunity.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Contemporary early outcome data of meconium Ileus (MI) in cystic fibrosis (CF) are lacking on a population level. We describe these and explore factors associated with successful non-operative management. METHODS: A prospective population-cohort study using an established surveillance system (BAPS-CASS) was conducted October 2012-September 2014. Live-born infants with bowel-obstruction from inspissated meconium in the terminal ileum and CF were reported. Data are described as median (interquartile range, IQR). RESULTS: 56 infants were identified. 14/56(25%) had primary laparotomy (13/23 complicated MI, 1/33 simple), the remainder underwent contrast enema. Twelve, (12/33 (36%) with simple MI) achieved decompression. 8/12 (67%) who decompressed had >1 enema vs 3/20 (15%) with simple MI who had laparotomy after enema. The number of enemas per infant (1-4), contrast agents and their concentration, were highly variable. Enterostomy was formed at 24/44(55%) of laparotomies. In infants with simple MI, time to full enteral feeds was 6 (2-10) days in those decompressing with enema vs 15 (9-19) days with laparotomy after enema. Case fatality was 4% (95% CI 0.4-12%). Two infants, both preterm died, both in the second month after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with simple MI achieving successful enema decompression were more likely to have had repeat enemas than those who proceeded to laparotomy. Successful non-operative management was associated with a shorter time to full feeds. The early management of infants with MI is highly variable and not standardised across the UK and Ireland.",

			"article_name": "Shared Environment and Genetics Shape the Gut Microbiome after Infant Adoption.",
			"abstract": "The composition of the human gut microbiome is highly variable, and this variation has been repeatedly tied to variation in human health. However, the sources of microbial variation remain unclear, especially early in life. It is particularly important to understand sources of early life variation in the microbiome because the state of the microbiome in childhood can influence lifelong health. Here, we compared the gut microbiomes of children adopted in infancy to those of genetically unrelated children in the same household and genetically related children raised in other households. We observed that a shared home environment was the strongest predictor of overall microbiome similarity. Among those microbial taxa whose variation was significantly explained by our models, the abundance of a given taxon was more frequently explained by host genetic similarity (relatedness), while the presence of a given taxon was more dependent upon a shared home environment. This suggests that although the home environment may act as a species source pool for the gut microbiome in childhood, host genetic factors likely drive variation in microbial abundance once a species colonizes the gut.IMPORTANCE Our results demonstrate that the early life home environment can significantly alter the gut microbiome in childhood, potentially altering health outcomes or risk for adverse health outcomes. A better understanding of the drivers of gut microbiome variation during childhood could lead to more effective intervention strategies for overall health starting in early life.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND Normal profiles of FBAs in healthy neonates and children in Kunming city and surrounding areas in China have not been previously determined. The objective of this study was to determine a developmental pattern of fecal bile acids (FBAs) in healthy neonates and children. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed on 238 healthy neonates and children recruited in the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, China from October 2015 to September 2016. Secreted primary and secondary FBAs in fresh feces were quantitated by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Amounts of FBAs in feces were compared among various age groups. RESULTS Trace amounts of cholic acid and chenodiol acid of primary FBAs were detectable at day 3 after birth, with a significant increase from day 3 to day 7. The primary FBAs gradually decreased from day 25 to the age of 6 years old. In contrast, a significant amount of glycochenodeoxycholic acid was detected on day 3 but decreased to a trace amount by day 7 and onwards. Primary FBAs appeared to maintain a high level, accounting for 98% of total FBAs, with no significant changes from day 7 to day 25 after birth. They gradually decreased from 90% to 10% from age 6 months to 6 years old. While the secondary FBAs were barely detected in neonates, only accounting for 2% of total FBAs, they were gradually elevated to 90% of total FBAs from age 6 months to 6 years old. CONCLUSIONS The liver can effectively synthesize primary bile acids 7 days after birth, and fecal primary bile acids tend to be stable after the neonate stage. Secondary bile acids continuously increase along with the maturation of intestinal flora, which reaches a relatively stable level at around 3 years old.",

We performed 16S amplicon sequencing in 558 stool samples from 132 ELBW preterm infants at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, PMW36, and 2 years. Probiotic supplementation results in increased bacterial diversity and increased L. reuteri abundance during the 1(st) month. At 1 week, probiotic supplementation also results in a lower abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae. No effects were found at 2 years. In conclusion, probiotics may exert benefits by modulating the gut microbiota composition during the 1(st) month in ELBW infants.",

			"abstract": "Alcohol consumption during pregnancy constitutes one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders in the exposed children. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) have been studied as potential biomarkers of alcohol consumption. However, most analytical approaches proposed for their analysis in meconium samples consist of separated extraction procedures requiring the use of two meconium aliquots, which is costly in terms of both time and materials. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a method for the simultaneous extraction of 9 FAEEs, EtG and EtS from one meconium aliquot. The sample was homogenized using methanol, and then FAEEs were extracted with hexane while EtG and EtS were isolated using acetonitrile. Then, extracts were applied to solid-phase extraction columns and analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (FAEEs) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (EtG and EtS). Calibration curves were linear with r values greater than 0.99. The LODs ranged from 0.8 to 7.5 ng/g for FAEEs and were 0.2 ng/g and 0.8 ng/g for EtS and EtG, respectively. LOQs ranged from 5 to 25 ng/g for FAEEs and were 1 ng/g and 2.5 ng/g for EtS and EtG, respectively. Accuracies and precisions were between 93.8 and 107% and between 3.5 and 9.7%, respectively. The recovery values ranged from 89.1 to 109%. The method proved to be sensitive, specific, simple and fast and allowed for the reduction of the amount of organic solvent used for extraction compared to other published data while higher recoveries were obtained. The method was used for analysis of meconium samples in two cases of mothers who were consuming alcohol during pregnancy.",

We comparatively analyzed the impact of human milk and two infant formulas in modulating the intestinal microbiota and the immune systems of mice colonized by healthy infant feces. The results showed that compared to infant formula, human milk decreased the levels of alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total protein. Also, it improved the immune system through the level of cytokines (CD4+ lymphocytes, Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells) and immunity indicators (IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, and sIgA). Human milk decreased intestinal mucosal permeability compared to infant formula. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that human milk increased the abundance of Akkermansia and Bacteroides, while infant formula increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Escherichia_Shigella. Collectively, our results showed that human milk is more suitable for infants than the two commercial infant formulas based on intestinal microbiota and immune system analyses. These findings thus support a theoretical basis for the development of infant formulas.",

A total of 320 samples underwent 16S amplicon sequencing, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on 94 samples from the 4M time point.

The present study explores the intra- and interspecific diversity, phylogenetic relationships, prevalence and distribution of tetra- and octonucleated cyst-producing Entamoeba in different Brazilian regions. METHODS: Cross-sectional studies were performed to collect fecal samples (n = 1728) and sociodemographic data in communities located in four Brazilian biomes: Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, and Amazon. Fecal samples were subjected to molecular analysis by partial small subunit ribosomal DNA sequencing (SSU rDNA) and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Light microscopy analysis revealed that tetranucleated cysts were found in all the studied biomes. The highest positivity rates were observed in the age group 6-10 years (23.21%). For octonucleated cysts, positivity rates ranged from 1 to 55.1%. Sixty SSU rDNA Entamoeba sequences were obtained, and four different species were identified: the octonucleated E. coli, and the tetranucleated E. histolytica, E. dispar, and E. hartmanni. Novel haplotypes (n = 32) were characterized; however, new ribosomal lineages were not identified. The Entamoeba coli ST1 subtype predominated in Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, and the ST2 subtype was predominant in the Amazon biome. E. histolytica was detected only in the Amazon biome. In phylogenetic trees, sequences were grouped in two groups, the first containing uni- and tetranucleated and the second containing uni- and octonucleated cyst-producing Entamoeba species. Molecular diversity indexes revealed a high interspecific diversity for tetra- and octonucleated Entamoeba spp. (H +/- SD = 0.9625 +/- 0.0126). The intraspecific diversity varied according to species or subtype: E. dispar and E. histolytica showed lower diversity than E. coli subtypes ST1 and ST2 and E. hartmanni. CONCLUSIONS: Tetra- and octonucleated cyst-producing Entamoeba are endemic in the studied communities; E. histolytica was found in a low proportion and only in the Amazon biome. With regard to E. coli, subtype ST2 was predominant in the Amazon biome. The molecular epidemiology of Entamoeba spp. is a field to be further explored and provides information with important implications for public health.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is a well-established risk factor for neonatal short-term respiratory complications. Little is known regarding the long-term morbidity. We investigated the possible association between MSAF and offspring respiratory morbidity. METHODS: A population-based, cohort study of singleton deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a sole regional tertiary medical center was performed. Incidence of offspring respiratory related hospitalizations up to the age of 18 years were evaluated and compared to unexposed offspring. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity incidence, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: During the study period 242,342 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 14.7% (n = 35,609) were complicated with MSAF. Incidence of respiratory-related hospitalizations was significantly lower in children exposed to MSAF as compared to the unexposed group (4.5% vs. 4.9%, respectively; p < .01). Specifically, hospitalizations involving pneumonitis were significantly less common among the MSAF group (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.13-0.96; p = .03). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated significantly lower total cumulative respiratory morbidity rates in the MSAF exposed group (log rank p < .01). In the Cox model, controlled for clinically relevant confounders, MSAF exhibited an independent and significant protective effect on long-term childhood respiratory morbidity (aHR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.96; p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal exposure to MSAF during labor appears to be associated with lower rates of long-term respiratory related hospitalizations in the offspring. Changes in offspring microbiome, as well as functional and anatomical modulations possibly resulting from MSAF exposure, might offer a plausible explanation of our findings.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to review the evidence regarding the clinical use and value of fecal calprotectin (FC) measurements in different gastrointestinal disorders in children. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases until October 31, 2019. Subtopics were identified and each assigned to individual authors. RESULTS: A total of 28 recommendations were voted on using the nominal voting technique. Recommendations are given related to sampling, measurement methods, and results interpretation. The 14 authors anonymously voted on each recommendation using a 9-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 9 fully agree). Consensus was considered achieved if at least 75% of the authors voted 6, 7, 8, or 9. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was reached for all recommendations. Limitations for the use of FC in clinical practice include variability in extraction methodology, performance of test kits as well as the need to establish local reference ranges because of the influence of individual factors, such as age, diet, microbiota, and drugs. The main utility of FC measurement at present is in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as to differentiate it from functional gastrointestinal disorders (FAPDs). FC, however, has neither utility in the diagnosis of infantile colic nor to differentiate between functional and organic constipation. A rise in FC concentration, may alert to the risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis and help identifying gastrointestinal involvement in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. FC measurement is of little value in Cow's Milk Protein Allergy, coeliac disease (CD), and cystic fibrosis. FC does neither help to distinguish bacterial from viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE), nor to diagnose Helicobacter Pylori infection, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), acute appendicitis (AA), or intestinal polyps.",

			"article_name": "Strain inheritance and neonatal gut microbiota development: A meta-analysis.",
			"abstract": "As many inflammatory and metabolic disorders have been associated with structural deficits of the human gut microbiota, the principles and mechanisms that govern its initialization and development are of considerable scientific interest and clinical relevance. However, our current understanding of the developing gut microbiota dynamics remains incomplete. We carried out a large-scale, comprehensive meta-analysis of over 1900 available metagenomic shotgun samples from neonates, infants, adolescents, and their families, using our recently introduced SameStr program for strain-level microbiota profiling and the detection of microbial strain transfer and persistence. We found robust associations between fecal microbiota composition and age, as well as delivery mode, which was measurable for up to two years of life. C-section was associated with increased relative abundances of non-gut species and delayed transition from a predominantly oxygen-tolerant to intolerant microbial community. Unsupervised networks based on shared strain profiles generated family-specific clusters connecting infants, their siblings, parents and grandparents and, in one case, suggested strain transfer between neonates from the same hospital ward, but could also be used to identify potentially mislabeled metagenome samples. Vaginally delivered newborns shared more strains with their mothers than C-section infants, but strain sharing was reduced if mothers underwent antibiotic treatment. Shared strains persisted in infants throughout the first year of life and belonged to the same bacterial species as strains that were shared between adults and their parents. Irrespective of delivery type, older children shared strains with their mothers and fathers and, into adulthood, could be accurately distinguished from unrelated sample pairs. Prominent fecal commensal bacteria were both among frequently transferred (e.g. Bacteroides and Sutterella) and newly acquired taxa (e.g. Blautia, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus). Our meta-analysis presents a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the highly dynamic neonatal and infant fecal microbiota development than previous studies and presents evidence for taxonomic and functional compositional differences early in life between infants born naturally or by C-section, which persist well into adolescence.",

			"abstract": "A few studies suggested high stereo-specifically numbered (sn)-2 palmitate in a formula might favor the gut Bifidobacteria of infants. The initial colonization and subsequent development of gut microbiota in early life might be associated with development and later life functions of the central nervous system via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, such as children with autism. This study aims to assess the hypothesized effect of increasing the amount of palmitic acid esterified in the sn-2 position in infant formula on neurodevelopment in healthy full-term infants and to explore the association of this effect with the altered gut Bifidobacteria. One hundred and ninety-nine infants were enrolled in this cluster randomized clinical trial: 66 breast-fed (BF group) and 133 formula-fed infants who were clustered and randomly assigned to receive formula containing high sn-2 palmitate (sn-2 group, n = 66) or low sn-2 palmitate (control group, n = 67), where 46.3% and 10.3% of the palmitic acid (PA) was sn-2-palmitate, respectively. Infants' neurodevelopmental outcomes were measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, third edition (ASQ-3). Stool samples were collected for the analysis of Bifidobacteria (Trial registration number: ChiCTR1800014479). At week 16, the risk of scoring close to the threshold for fine motor skills (reference: scoring above the typical development threshold) was significantly lower in the sn-2 group than the control group after adjustment for the maternal education level (p = 0.036) but did not differ significantly versus the BF group (p = 0.513). At week 16 and week 24, the sn-2 group (week 16: 15.7% and week 24: 15.6%) had a significantly higher relative abundance of fecal Bifidobacteria than the control group (week 16: 6.6%, p = 0.001 and week 24:11.2%, p = 0.028) and did not differ from the BF group (week 16: 14.4%, p = 0.674 and week 24: 14.9%, p = 0.749). At week 16, a higher relative abundance of Bifidobacteria was associated with the decreased odds of only one domain scoring close to the threshold in the formula-fed infants group (odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.947 (0.901-0.996)). Elevating the sn-2 palmitate level in the formula improved infants' development of fine motor skills, and the beneficial effects of high sn-2 palmitate on infant neurodevelopment was associated with the increased gut Bifidobacteria level.",

Because of the lack of detail in the statistics it is not possible to do a rigorous meta-analysis. What stands out is that almost every study had subjects with seemingly large amounts of at least one of the metals. The significance of metals in meconium is not clear beyond an indication of exposure although some studies have correlated metals in meconium to a number of adverse outcomes. A number of outstanding questions have been identified that, if resolved, would greatly increase the utility of meconium analysis for assessment of long-term gestational metals exposures. Among these are questions of the developmental and long-term significance of metals detected in meconium, the kinetics and interactions among metals in maternal and fetal compartments and questions on best methods for meconium analyses.",

We set out to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of early viral infections experienced before the age of one year on the peripheral regulatory T cell population (Treg) and circulating cytokines in a birth-cohort study of Estonian and Finnish infants. We show here a temporal association of virus infection with the expression of FOXP3 in regulatory T cells. Infants with rhinovirus infection during the preceding 30 days had a higher FOXP3 expression in Treg cells and decreased levels of several cytokines related to Th1 and Th2 responses in comparison to the children without infections. In contrast, FOXP3 expression was significantly decreased in highly activated (CD4+CD127-/loCD25+FOXP3high) regulatory T cells (TregFOXP3high) in the infants who had enterovirus infection during the preceding 30 or 60 days. After enterovirus infections, the cytokine profile showed an upregulation of Th1- and Th17-related cytokines and a decreased activation of CCL22, which is a chemokine derived from dendritic cells and associated with Th2 deviation. Our results reveal that immunoregulatory mechanisms are up-regulated after rhinovirus infections, while enterovirus infections are associated with activation of proinflammatory pathways and decreased immune regulation.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Mozambique, infection by intestinal parasites is reported all over the country. However, infection in children with diarrhoea is mostly focused in the southern region of Mozambique. This work aims to determine the frequency and potential risk factors for infection by Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica in children under-five years hospitalized with diarrhoea in Hospital Central de Nampula, northern Mozambique. METHODS: A cross-sectional hospital-based surveillance was conducted between March 2015 and January 2018 in children admitted with diarrhoea in Hospital Central de Nampula. Sociodemographic information was obtained through semi-structured interviews applied to the children's caregivers. A single stool sample was collected from each child to detect antigens from Cryptosporidium spp., G. lamblia, and E. histolytica using an immune-enzymatic technique. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (with 95% Confidence Intervals) were obtained by logistic regression models to identify factors associated with infection by Cryptosporidium spp. and G. lamblia. RESULTS: The median age and interquartile intervals of our sample population was 12 months (8-20). Intestinal protozoa were detected in 21.4% (59/276). Cryptosporidium spp. was the most common protozoa (13.9% - 38/274), followed by G. lamblia (9.1% - 25/274) and E. histolytica (0.4% - 1/275). Children with illiterate caregiver's (p-value = 0.042) and undernourished (p-value = 0.011) were more likely to be infected by Cryptosporidium spp. G. lamblia was more common in children living in households with more than four members (p-value = 0.039). E. histolytica was detected in an eleven month's child, co-infected with Cryptosporidium spp. and undernourished. CONCLUSION: Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia lamblia were the most common pathogenic intestinal protozoa detected in children with diarrhoea hospitalized in the Hospital Central de Nampula. Our findings obtained highlight the importance of exploring the caregiver's education level, children's nutritional status for infections with Cryptosporidium spp., and living conditions, namely crowded households for infections with G. lamblia in children younger than five years.",

			"abstract": "This study aimed to identify the specimen type that has high positivity and its proper sampling time for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to promote diagnostic efficiency. All SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis in Zhoushan City were followed up for viral shedding in respiratory tract specimens and faecal samples. Positivity was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively by proper statistical approaches with strong testing power. Viral shedding in respiratory tract and faecal specimens was prolonged to 45 and 40 days after the last exposure, respectively. The overall positive rate in respiratory tract specimens was low and relatively unstable, being higher in the early-to-mid stage than in the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. Compared with respiratory tract specimens, faecal samples had a higher viral load, higher overall positive rate, and more stable positivity in different disease courses and varied symptomatic status. Faecal specimens have the potential ability to surpass respiratory tract specimens in virus detection. Testing of faecal specimens in diagnosis, especially for identifying asymptomatic carriers, is recommended. Simultaneously, testing respiratory tract specimens at the early-to-mid stage is better than testing at the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. A relatively small sample size was noted, and statistical approaches were used to address it. Information was missing for both specimen types at different stages of the disease course due to censored data. Our research extends the observed viral shedding in both specimen types and highlights the importance of faecal specimen testing in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Healthcare workers, patients, and the general public may all benefit from our study findings. Disposal of sewage from hospitals and residential areas should be performed cautiously because the virus sheds in faeces and can last for a long time.",

			"abstract": "Identifying and tracking microbial strains as microbiomes evolve are major challenges in the field of microbiome research. We utilized a new sequencing kit that combines DNA extraction with PCR amplification of a large region of the rRNA operon and downstream bioinformatic data analysis. Longitudinal microbiome samples of coadmitted twins from two different neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were analyzed using an  approximately 2,500-base amplicon that spans the 16S and 23S rRNA genes and mapped to a new, custom 16S-23S rRNA database. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) inferred using DADA2 provided sufficient resolution for the differentiation of rRNA variants from closely related but not previously sequenced Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter strains, among the first bacteria colonizing the gut of these infants after admission to the NICU. Distinct ASV groups (fingerprints) were monitored between coadmitted twins over time, demonstrating the potential to track the source and spread of both commensals and pathogens. The high-resolution taxonomy obtained from long amplicon sequencing enables the tracking of strains temporally and spatially as microbiomes are established in infants in the hospital environment.IMPORTANCE Achieving strain-level resolution is a major obstacle for source tracking and temporal studies of microbiomes. In this study, we describe a novel deep-sequencing approach that provides species- and strain-level resolution of the neonatal microbiome. Using Klebsiella, E. coli, and Enterobacter as examples, we could monitor their temporal dynamics after antibiotic treatment and in pairs of twins. The strain-level resolution, combined with the greater sequencing depth and decreased cost per read of PacBio Sequel 2, enables this advantageous source- and strain-tracking analysis method to be implemented widely across more complex microbiomes.",

The aim of the study was to assess the effects of a specific synbiotic combination at doses closer to the bacterial cells present in human milk, on intestinal bifidobacteria proportions (relative abundance), reduction of potential pathogens and gut physiological conditions. A clinical study was conducted in 290 healthy infants aged from 6 to 19 weeks. Infants received either a control infant formula or one of the two investigational infant formulas (control formula with 0.8 g/100 ml scGOS/lcFOS and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V at either 1 x 10(4) cfu/ml or 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml). Exclusively breastfed infants were included as a reference. Analyses were performed on intention-to-treat groups and all-subjects-treated groups. After 6 weeks of intervention, the synbiotics at two different doses significantly increased the bifidobacteria proportions in healthy infants. The synbiotic supplementation also decreased the prevalence (infants with detectable levels) and the abundance of C. difficile. Closer to the levels in the breastfed reference group, fecal pH was significantly lower while L-lactate concentrations and acetate proportions were significantly higher in the synbiotic groups. All formulas were well tolerated and all groups showed a comparable safety profile based on the number and severity of adverse events and growth. In healthy infants, supplementation of infant-type bifidobacterial strain B. breve M-16V, at a dose close to bacterial numbers found in human milk, with scGOS/lcFOS (9:1) created a gut environment closer to the breastfed reference group. This specific synbiotic mixture may also support gut microbiota resilience during early life.Clinical Trial Registration This clinical study named Color Synbiotics Study, was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on 18 March 2013.

In the paediatric patient population, the reference value of < 50 mug/g and the influence of age on FCP levels result in a high number of redundant investigations and specialist referrals. We assessed paediatric FCP levels, their diagnostic value and corresponding referral pathways from primary and secondary care. METHODS: We analysed two cohorts from a precisely defined catchment area: one consisted of all FCPs measured in this area (n = 2788). The second cohort-a subset of the first cohort-consisted of FCP values and corresponding clinical data from children who were referred for possible IBD to our department (n = 373). RESULTS: In the first cohort, 47% of FCP levels were > 50 mug/g, 15% were >/= 250 mug/g. Children < 1y had significantly (p < 0.001) higher FCP than older children. In the second cohort, 6.7% of children with an FCP of < 250 mug/g (or 8.6% with an FCP of < 600 mug/g) had IBD-all featured symptoms suggestive of IBD (e.g. bloody diarrhoea, nocturnal abdominal pain, weight loss) or abnormal blood tests. 76% of patients in whom raised FCP (> 50 mug/g) was the sole reason for being referred for suspected IBD did not have IBD. CONCLUSION: Children with an FCP < 600 mug/g and without matching symptoms suggestive of IBD are unlikely to have IBD. A higher FCP reference value may provide cost-effective improvement that could avoid redundant investigations and specialist referrals. A guideline for specialist referrals is proposed.",

It is usually caused by viral agents, including rotavirus (RV), norovirus (NoV), adenovirus (AdV), astrovirus (AstV), and sapovirus (SaV), and the disease severity varies accordingly. Here, we report the association of clinical severity among AGE-infected pediatrics caused by a single viral pathogen, coinfection (viral-viral), mixed infection (viral-bacterial), and AGE-negative samples. METHODS: A total of 901 pediatric patients were admitted with AGE to the Pediatric Emergency Center of Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar from June 2016 to June 2018. The age of the subjects ranged between 3 months and 14 years (median of 16 months). Virus antigens detection was performed by using Film Array Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel kit. AGE severity was assessed using the Vesikari Clinical Severity Scoring System. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to model the five AGE viral agents' likelihood in relation to severity versus co-infection, mixed infection, and AGE-negative samples. RESULTS: AGE was most common in pediatrics aged 1-3 years (median age = 1.25 years) and more frequent in males than females, with a ratio of 1:0.8. About 19.2% of the infections were caused by NoV, followed by RV (18.2%), AdV (6.5%), SaV (2.3%), and AstV (1.8%). The majority of viral agents were detected higher in mixed infection (32.1%) than coinfection (4.9%). Based on the Vesikari score system, severe clinical illness was recorded among pediatrics infected with RV (82.2%) and NoV (75.7%). Further on multivariable analysis, compared to testing negative, the odds of detecting RV was three times significantly higher in children with severe symptoms relative to those with moderate (adjusted-odds ratio [a-OR] = 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.82-5.28). Similar results were observed when considering RV relative to co-infection and mixed infection (a-OR = 2.59; 95% CI = 1.23-5.48 and a-OR = 2.06; 1.28-3.30, respectively). About one-third of the study sample were Qatari children with AGE (33%), whereas 35% and 32% were pediatrics from the Middle East and North Africa region, excluding Qatari and nonregions. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the association of disease severity among AGE-infected pediatrics in Qatar. The overall Vesikari median score was significantly high, followed by more frequent hospitalization among RV-infected pediatrics compared to others. There was no reduction in the disease severity among RV-infected regardless of the vaccine dose.",

Detailed clinical history and sociodemographic information was collected for all enrolled children. Severity of the gastroenteritis was assessed using the 20-point Vesikari Clinical Severity Scoring System. Rotavirus positivity was tested in the stool samples collected from children by commercially available techniques and further molecular characterization done as per defined protocol.

Among children who were less than 24 mo of age, positivity due to rotavirus diarrhea was maximum (24.4%). Distinct seasonality was observed as maximum cases of rotavirus diarrhea were detected in the months of December to February. Commonest G type was G3 (54%) followed by G1 (19%) while predominant P type was P[8] (77%) followed by P[4] (11%). G3P[8] (51.83%) was the commonest genotype observed in the study region. CONCLUSION: The current study found positivity of rotavirus to be 18.95% among children aged 0-59 mo admitted due to acute gastroenteritis is a tertiary care setting in northern part of India. Emergence of newer predominant strains emphasizes the need of continued surveillance to determine the changing trends.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although Toxocara spp. infection has a worldwide distribution, to our knowledge, no data from birth cohorts have been reported in published studies on the potential for congenital transmission and determinants of infection in early childhood. METHODS: We followed 290 mother-infant pairs from birth to 5 years of age through periodic collection of data and samples at birth, 7 and 13 months and 2, 3 and 5 years of age. Data on potential risk factors and confounders were collected by maternal questionnaire. Blood for plasma was collected from the mother at time of birth and periodically from the child for detection of anti-Toxocara spp. immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using a Toxocara canis larval excretory-secretory antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Stool samples were collected from the mother around the time of birth and periodically from the child for microscopic detection of soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Associations between potential risk factors and Toxocara spp. seroprevalence and seroconversion were estimated using multivariable logistic regression and generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Toxocara spp. seroprevalence was 80.7% in mothers and in children was 0%, 9.3%, 48.4%, 64.9%, and 80.9% at 7 months, 13 months, 2, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Risk factors significantly associated with increases in seroprevalence over the first 5 years of life in multivariable analyses were age [Odds ratio (OR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.27, P < 0001], male sex (female vs. male: OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.89, P = 0.006), maternal ethnicity (non-Afro vs. Afro-Ecuadorian: OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.91, P = 0.011), lower maternal educational and socioeconomic level, and childhood STH (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.51-3.47, P < 0.001). Seroconversion rates for infection were greatest at 2 years of age (3.8%/month). Factors associated significantly with seroconversion at 2, 3 or 5 years were childhood STH infection, male sex, and more frequent domestic cat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, from an area of high Toxocara spp. endemicity, indicate no congenital transmission but high rates of seroconversion after 13 months of age reaching maternal levels of seroprevalence by 5 years of age. Factors associated with seroprevalence and seroconversion included STH infections, domestic cats, maternal ethnicity, male sex, STH infections, and markers of greater poverty.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the effects on the gut microbiome of 40 infants delivered before term by cesarean section between antibiotic treatment and probiotics as assessed by 16S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) sequencing. MATERIAL AND METHODS We divided 40 premature infants delivered by cesarean section into 4 groups according to exposure to antibiotics or probiotics: N group (No-probiotics and No-antibiotics), A group (antibiotics), P group (probiotics), and the AP group (antibiotics+probiotics). Fecal samples were collected on days 1, 3, and 10, and the microflora data were generated using 16S rRNA qPCR sequencing technology. The BugBase tool was used for phenotype prediction, the Tax4Fun tool was used for function prediction, and iPath software was used to predict the metabolic pathways of intestinal bacteria. RESULTS Antibiotics increased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria and reduced the replication and repair function (P=0.049), nucleotide metabolism function (P=0.047), and the purine metabolism pathways (P<0.05) of the gut microbiota. Probiotics increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria and the cellular community prokaryote function (P=0.042) and contributed to the Bifidobacteria biofilm formation. Probiotics alleviated the damage of antibiotics to the composition and function of the gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study showed that antibiotic treatment of preterm infants born by cesarean section changed the gut microbiome, but that the use of probiotics could restore the normal microbiome, which supports that restoration of the normal gut microbiota may be achieved with probiotics.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the distribution of Escherichia Coli (E. coli) pathotypes in Iran is limited. This nation-wide survey aims to provide a comprehensive description of the distribution of five pathogenic E. coli in Iran. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 1,306 acute diarrhea cases from 15 provinces (2013-2014). E. coli-positive cultures underwent PCR testing for the detection of STEC, ETEC, EPEC, EAEC, and EIEC pathotypes. Pathotype frequency by province, age-group, and season was estimated. RESULTS: 979 diarrhea samples (75.0%) were culture-positive for E. coli (95% CI: 72.6, 77.3%), and 659 (50.5%) were pathogenic E. coli (95% CI: 47.8, 53.2%). STEC was the most frequent pathotype (35.4%). ETEC (14.0%) and EPEC (13.1%) were the second and the third most frequent pathotypes, respectively. EAEC (4.3%) and EIEC (0.3%) were not highly prevalent. Fars (88.7%) and Khorasan-e-Razavi (34.8%) provinces had the highest and lowest frequencies, respectively. E. coli pathotypes were more frequent in warmer than cooler seasons, showed the highest frequency among children under five years of age (73%), and had no significant association with participants' gender. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrheagenic E. coli may be an important cause of acute diarrhea in adults and children in Iran. STEC and ETEC seem to be widespread in the country with a peak in warmer seasons, impacting the recommended use of seasonal STEC and ETEC vaccines, especially in high-risk groups. Monitoring the incidence of E. coli pathotypes, serotypes, and antibiotic resistance over time is highly recommended for evaluation of interventions.",

			"abstract": "Human milk stimulates a health-promoting gut microbiome in infants. However, it is unclear how the microbiota salvages and processes its required nitrogen from breast milk. Human milk nitrogen sources such as urea could contribute to the composition of this early life microbiome. Urea is abundant in human milk, representing a large part of the non-protein nitrogen (NPN). We found that B. longum subsp. infantis (ATCC17930) can use urea as a main source of nitrogen for growth in synthetic medium and enzyme activity was induced by the presence of urea in the medium. We furthermore confirmed the expression of both urease protein subunits and accessory proteins of B. longum subsp. infantis through proteomics. To the same end, metagenome data were mined for urease-related genes. It was found that the breastfed infant's microbiome possessed more urease-related genes than formula fed infants (51.4:22.1; 2.3-fold increase). Bifidobacteria provided a total of 106 of urease subunit alpha alignments, found only in breastfed infants. These experiments show how an important gut commensal that colonizes the infant intestine can metabolize urea. The results presented herein further indicate how dietary nitrogen can determine bacterial metabolism in the neonate gut and shape the overall microbiome.",

In Nicaragua, the burden, risk factors, and species diversity for infant campylobacteriosis are unknown. Between June 2017 and December 2018, we enrolled 444 infants from Leon, Nicaragua, in a population-based birth cohort, conducting weekly household AGE surveillance. First, we described clinical characteristics of symptomatic Campylobacter infections, and then compared clinical characteristics between Campylobacter jejuni/coli and non-jejuni/coli infections. Next, we conducted a nested case-control analysis to examine campylobacteriosis risk factors. Finally, we estimated the population attributable fraction of campylobacteriosis among infants experiencing AGE. Of 296 AGE episodes in the first year of life, Campylobacter was detected in 59 (20%), 39 were C. jejuni/coli, and 20 were non-jejuni/coli species, including the first report of Campylobacter vulpis infection in humans. Acute gastroenteritis symptoms associated with C. jejuni/coli lasted longer than those attributed to other Campylobacter species. In a conditional logistic regression model, chickens in the home (odds ratio [OR]: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.4-9.8), a prior AGE episode (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.8), and poverty (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.9) were independently associated with campylobacteriosis. Comparing 90 infants experiencing AGE with 90 healthy controls, 22.4% (95% CI: 11.2-32.1) of AGE episodes in the first year of life could be attributed to Campylobacter infection. Campylobacter infections contribute substantially to infant AGE in Leon, Nicaragua, with non-jejuni/coli species frequently detected. Reducing contact with poultry in the home and interventions to prevent all-cause AGE may reduce campylobacteriosis in this setting.",

			"abstract": "The point-of-care urine based strip test for the detection of circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) in schistosome infections is a frequently used tool for diagnosis and mapping of Schistosoma mansoni in school-aged children. Because of its ease of use, the test is increasingly applied to adults and preschool-aged children (PSAC), but its performance has not been specifically evaluated in these target groups. Recent observations have raised concerns about possible reduced specificity, in particular in pregnant women (PW) and PSAC. We thus explored specificity of the POC-CCA urine strip test (Rapid Medical Diagnostics, Pretoria, South Africa) in a non-endemic, nonexposed population of 47 healthy nonpregnant adults (NPAs), 52 PW, and 58 PSAC. A total of 157 urines were tested with POC-CCA, of which five (10.6%) NPAs, 17 (32.7%) PW, and 27 (46.5%) PSAC were positive. The highest scores were found in the youngest babies, with an infant of 9 months being the oldest positive case. On measuring pH, it appeared that all POC-CCA strongly positive urines were acidic (pH range 5-5.5), whereas addition of pH-neutral buffer to a subsample reversed the false positivity. We conclude that the POC-CCA test has reduced specificity in PW and infants younger than 9 months, but that the false positivity might be eliminated by modifications in the buffers used in the test.",

			"abstract": "Efficient lipid digestion in formula-fed infants is required to ensure the availability of fatty acids for normal organ development. Previous studies suggest that the efficiency of lipid digestion may depend on whether lipids are emulsified with soy lecithin or fractions derived from bovine milk. This study, therefore, aimed to determine whether emulsification with bovine milk-derived emulsifiers or soy lecithin (SL) influenced lipid digestion in vitro and in vivo. Lipid digestibility was determined in vitro in oil-in-water emulsions using four different milk-derived emulsifiers or SL, and the ultrastructural appearance of the emulsions was assessed using electron microscopy. Subsequently, selected emulsions were added to a base diet and fed to preterm neonatal piglets. Initially, preterm pigs equipped with an ileostomy were fed experimental formulas for seven days and stoma output was collected quantitatively. Next, lipid absorption kinetics was studied in preterm pigs given pure emulsions. Finally, complete formulas with different emulsions were fed for four days, and the post-bolus plasma triglyceride level was determined. Milk-derived emulsifiers (containing protein and phospholipids from milk fat globule membranes and extracellular vesicles) showed increased effects on fat digestion compared to SL in an in vitro digestion model. Further, milk-derived emulsifiers significantly increased the digestion of triglyceride in the preterm piglet model compared with SL. Ultra-structural images indicated a more regular and smooth surface of fat droplets emulsified with milk-derived emulsifiers relative to SL. We conclude that, relative to SL, milk-derived emulsifiers lead to a different surface ultrastructure on the lipid droplets, and increase lipid digestion.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: A processed diet, high in fat and low in fiber, is associated with differences in the gut microbiota and adverse health outcomes in humans; however, little is known about the diet-microbiota relation and its impact on pregnancy. Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), a pregnancy outcome with serious short- and long-term consequences, occurs more frequently in black and in obese women in the United States. OBJECTIVES: In a prospective, case-control sample matched for race and obesity (cases = 16, controls = 32), we compared the fecal gut microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and diet in the late second trimester. We hypothesized that a Western diet would be associated with reduced microbiota richness and a metabolic signature predicting incidence of SPTB. METHODS: The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S-tagged sequencing and untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze both plasma and fecal metabolites. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used for the comparison of microbiota genera, alpha-diversity, fecal and plasma metabolites, and dietary variables between term and SPTB. beta-Diversity was analyzed using permutational multivariate ANOVA, and metabolite associations were assessed by module analysis. RESULTS: A decrease in alpha-diversity was strongly associated with the development of SPTB, especially in the taxonomic class of Betaproteobacteria. Of 824 fecal metabolites, 22 metabolites (mostly lipids) differed between cases and controls (P < 0.01), with greater DHA (22:6n-3) and EPA (20:5n-3) in cases [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.2]. The most significant fecal metabolite module (FDR-adjusted P = 0.008) was dominated by DHA and EPA. Dietary saturated fat (primarily palmitate) intake was greater in cases (31.38 +/- 7.37 compared with 26.08 +/- 8.62 g, P = 0.045) and was positively correlated with fecal DHA and EPA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota and higher excretion of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in stool may provide a novel biomarker signature predicting SPTB in women with a low-fiber, high-fat diet. Further investigation of these markers in a larger sample is needed for validation.",

We find significant attenuation of weight and height gain during the first 6 years of life after neonatal antibiotic exposure in boys, but not in girls, after adjusting for potential confounders. In contrast, antibiotic use after the neonatal period but during the first 6 years of life is associated with significantly higher body mass index throughout the study period in both boys and girls. Neonatal antibiotic exposure is associated with significant differences in the gut microbiome, particularly in decreased abundance and diversity of fecal Bifidobacteria until 2 years of age. Finally, we demonstrate that fecal microbiota transplant from antibiotic-exposed children to germ-free male, but not female, mice results in significant growth impairment. Thus, we conclude that neonatal antibiotic exposure is associated with a long-term gut microbiome perturbation and may result in reduced growth in boys during the first six years of life while antibiotic use later in childhood is associated with increased body mass index.",

Evidence regarding the effects of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy is conflicting. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in biological samples during pregnancy (placenta, umbilical cord or amniotic fluid); however, maternal and fetal effects of the virus are not well known. METHODS: Descriptive, multicentre, longitudinal, observational study in eight tertiary care hospitals throughout Spain, that are referral centres for pregnant women with COVID-19. All pregnant women with positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction during their pregnancy or 14 days preconception and newborns born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. They will continue to be followed up until 4 weeks after delivery. The aim of the study is to investigate both the effect of COVID-19 on the pregnancy, and the effect of the pregnancy status with the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 disease. Other samples (faeces, urine, serum, amniotic fluid, cord and peripheral blood, placenta and breastmilk) will be collected in order to analyse whether or not there is a risk of vertical transmission and to describe the behaviour of the virus in other fluids. Neonates will be followed until 6 months after delivery to establish the rate of neonatal transmission. We aim to include 150 pregnant women and their babies. Ethics approval will be obtained from all the participating centres. DISCUSSION: There is little information known about COVID-19 and its unknown effects on pregnancy. This study will collect a large number of samples in pregnant women which will allow us to demonstrate the behaviour of the virus in pregnancy and postpartum in a representative cohort of the Spanish population.",

Additionally, early-life infections by this protozoan have been associated with impaired growth and cognitive function in poor resource settings. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in Mozambique demonstrated that G. duodenalis was more frequent among controls than in diarrhoeal cases (>/=3 loosing stools in the previous 24 hours). However, no molecular investigation was conducted to ascertain the molecular variability of the parasite. Therefore, we describe here the frequency and genetic diversity of G. duodenalis infections in children younger than five years of age with and without diarrhoea from the Manhica district in southern Mozambique enrolled in the context of GEMS. Genomic DNA from 757 G. duodenalis-positive stool samples by immunoassay collected between 2007-2012, were reanalysed by multiplex PCR targeting the E1-HP and C1-P21 genes for the differentiation of assemblages A and B. Overall, 47% (353) of the samples were successfully amplified in at least one locus. Assemblage B accounted for 90% (319/353) of all positives, followed by assemblage A (8%, 29/353) and mixed A+B infections (1%, 5/353). No association between the presence of a given assemblage and the occurrence of diarrhoea could be demonstrated. A total of 351 samples were further analysed by a multi-locus sequence genotyping (MLSG) approach at the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), ss-giardin (bg) and triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) genes. Overall, 63% (222/351) of samples were genotyped and/or sub-genotyped in at least one of the three markers. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of assemblages A (10%; 23/222) and B (90%; 199/222) with high molecular diversity at the nucleotide level within the latter; no mixed infections were identified under the MLSG scheme. Assemblage A sequences were assigned to sub-assemblages AI (0.5%, 1/222), AII (7%, 15/222) or ambiguous AII/AIII (3%, 7/222). Within assemblage B, sequences were assigned to sub-assemblages BIII (13%, 28/222), BIV (14%, 31/222) and ambiguous BIII/BIV (59%, 132/222). BIII/BIV sequences accumulated the majority of the single nucleotide polymorphisms detected, particularly in the form of double peaks at chromatogram inspection. This study demonstrated that the occurrence of gastrointestinal illness (diarrhoea) was not associated to a given genotype of G. duodenalis in Mozambican children younger than five years of age. The assemblage B of the parasite was responsible for nine out of ten infections detected in this paediatric population. The extremely high genetic diversity observed within assemblage B isolates was compatible with an hyperendemic epidemiological scenario where infections and reinfections were common. The obtained molecular data may be indicative of high coinfection rates by different G. duodenalis assemblages/sub-assemblages and/or genetic recombination events, although the exact contribution of both mechanisms to the genetic diversity of the parasite remains unknown.",

			"abstract": "Rotaviruses are the dominant cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age. Previous studies showed that some children are less susceptible to rotavirus gastroenteritis. It has been shown that this resistance depends on the rotavirus genotype and also human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which works as a receptor for rotavirus surface protein (VP4). The present study aimed to evaluate the human genetic susceptibility to rotavirus gastroenteritis in Iran and to obtain a comparative analysis between rotavirus gastroenteritis and secretor or Lewis status in case and control groups in the Iranian population. The study was performed on fecal specimens from 108 children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis from 2015 to 2017. A total of 50 fecal specimens from children with acute gastroenteritis of unknown etiology were also used as a control group. After the genotyping of positive rotavirus cases and human HBGAs by Sanger sequencing, the phylogenetic tree analysis showed that all rotavirus strains from Iran belonged to P[II]. The most common genotype was P[8] (n = 102; 94.4%), while the remaining belonged to P[4] (n = 3; 2.8%) and P[6] (n = 3; 2.8%) genotypes. The P[8] genotype was found to be associated with secretor and Lewis positive status (p < .05).",

			"abstract": "The nutritional drivers for mother-child sharing of bacteria and the corresponding longitudinal trajectory of the infant gut microbiota development are not yet completely settled. We therefore aimed to characterize the mother-child sharing and the inferred nutritional utilization potential for the gut microbiota from a large unselected cohort. We analyzed in depth gut microbiota in 100 mother-child pairs enrolled antenatally from the general population-based Preventing Atopic Dermatitis and Allergies in Children (PreventADALL) cohort. Fecal samples collected at gestational week 18 for mothers and at birth (meconium), 3, 6, and 12 months for infants were analyzed by reduced metagenome sequencing to determine metagenome size and taxonomic composition. The nutrient utilization potential was determined based on the Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH, www.vmh.life) database. The estimated median metagenome size was  approximately 150 million base pairs (bp) for mothers and  approximately 20 million bp at birth for the children. Longitudinal analyses revealed mother-child sharing (P < 0.05, chi-square test) from birth up to 6 months for 3 prevalent Bacteroides species (prevalence, >25% for all age groups). In a multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), the mother-child-shared Bacteroides were associated with vaginal delivery (1.7% explained variance, P = 0.0001). Both vaginal delivery and mother-child sharing were associated with host-derived mucins as nutrient sources. The age-related increase in metagenome size corresponded to an increased diversity in nutrient utilization, with dietary polysaccharides as the main age-related factor. Our results support host-derived mucins as potential selection means for mother-child sharing of initial colonizers, while the age-related increase in diversity was associated with dietary polysaccharides.IMPORTANCE The initial bacterial colonization of human infants is crucial for lifelong health. Understanding the factors driving this colonization will therefore be of great importance. Here, we used a novel high-taxonomic-resolution approach to deduce the nutrient utilization potential of the infant gut microbiota in a large longitudinal mother-child cohort. We found mucins as potential selection means for the initial colonization of mother-child-shared bacteria, while the transition to a more adult-like microbiota was associated with dietary polysaccharide utilization potential. This knowledge will be important for a future understanding of the importance of diet in shaping the gut microbiota composition and development during infancy.",

Expanded National rotavirus surveillance network in India reported high burden of rotavirus diarrhea in India. The Government of India introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine made in India by Bharat Biotech in the national immunization programme from 2016 onward along with oral polio vaccine (OPV) and Pentavalent vaccines. METHODS: A multi-centric, hospital-based surveillance study in the initial vaccine introducing states was started in a phased manner over a period of 3 y. PGIMS, Rohtak is a tertiary care center and was a part of the surveillance from 2016 to 2019. Children aged 0-59 mo admitted with acute gastroenteritis were enrolled into the surveillance and their stool samples were collected. Samples were tested at Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore to detect rotavirus and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for G and P typing. RESULTS: A total of 904 children were enrolled in the present surveillance over a period of 3 y starting 1st July 2016 to 30th June 2019. Stool samples were collected and analyzed for 827 children and out of them 141 samples were positive for rotavirus (17.1%). Maximum rotavirus positivity was observed during the winter months. Rotavirus positivity percentage was observed maximum in 12-23 mo age group. A declining trend was observed in rotavirus positivity from 22.8% in 2016 to 14.5% in 2019. Most common strains of rotavirus isolated were G3P[8] followed by G1P[8]. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that epidemiology of acute gastroenteritis among children less than 5 y of age in Haryana postintroduction of rotavirus vaccination in the state and the decline in rotavirus positivity from 22.8% in 2016 to 14.5% in 2019.",

			"abstract": "For more than a century, the prenatal environment was considered sterile. Over the last few years, findings obtained with next-generation sequencing approaches from samples of the placenta, the amniotic fluid, meconium, and even fetal tissues have challenged the dogma of a sterile womb, and additional reports have emerged that used culture, microscopy, and quantitative PCR to support the presence of a low-biomass microbial community at prenatal sites. Given the substantial implications of prenatal exposure to microbes for the development and health of the host, the findings have gathered substantial interest from academics, high impact journals, the public press, and funding agencies. However, an increasing number of studies have challenged the prenatal microbiome identifying contamination as a major issue, and scientists that remained skeptical have pointed to inconsistencies with in utero colonization, the impact of c-sections on early microbiome assembly, and the ability to generate germ-free mammals. A lively academic controversy has emerged on the existence of the wider importance of prenatal microbial communities. Microbiome has asked experts to discuss these issues and provide their thoughts on the implications. To allow for a broader perspective of this discussion, we have specifically selected scientists, who have a long-standing expertise in microbiome sciences but who have not directly been involved in the debate so far.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mozambique has a high burden of group A rotavirus (RVA) infection and chronic undernutrition. This study aimed to determine the frequency and potential risk factors for RVA infection in undernourished children under 5 years old with diarrhoea in Mozambique. METHODS: The analysis was conducted using data from March 2015 to December 2017, regarding children under 5 years old with at least one type of undernutrition. Anthropometric measures were used to calculate indices of weight-for-age, weight-for-height and height-for-age through the Z-Scores. RVA results were extracted from the National Diarrhoea Surveillance database. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test was used for qualitative variables and organized in contingency tables and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were considered for the calculation of RVA infection proportion and in the multiple logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AOR). RESULTS: Of the 842 undernourished children included in the analysis, 27.2% (95% CI: 24.3-30.3%) were positive for RVA. The rate of RVA infection was 42.7% (95% CI: 38.0-47.5%) in the pre-vaccine period, with great reduction to 12.2% (95% CI: 9.4-15.6%) in the post-vaccine period. Most of the RVA undernourished children had severe wasting (33.3%) and severe stunting (32.0%). The risk of infection was significantly high in children from 0 to 11 months (p-value < 0.001) when compared to the age group of 24-59 months. A higher proportion of RVA infection was detected in households with five or more members (p-value = 0.029). Similar proportions of RVA were observed in children fed only by breast milk (34.9%) and breast milk with formula (35.6%). A higher proportion of undernourished HIV-positive children co-infected with RVA (7.4%) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of RVA infection in undernourished children declined following the introduction of the vaccine in Mozambique. Beyond the temporal variation, Maputo province, age and crowded households were also associated to RVA infection. A high proportion of RVA infection was observed in children with severe wasting and a triple burden of disease: undernutrition, RVA and HIV, highlighting the need to conduct follow-up studies to understand the long-term impact of these conditions on children's development.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence of enteric infections in Aboriginal children aged 0-2 years using conventional and molecular diagnostic techniques and to explore associations between the presence of pathogens and child growth. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of Aboriginal children (n = 62) residing in a remote community in Northern Australia, conducted from July 24th - October 30th 2017. Stool samples were analysed for organisms by microscopy (directly in the field and following fixation and storage in sodium-acetate formalin), and by qualitative PCR for viruses, bacteria and parasites and serology for Strongyloides-specific IgG. Child growth (height and weight) was measured and z scores calculated according to WHO growth standards. RESULTS: Nearly 60% of children had evidence for at least one enteric pathogen in their stool (37/62). The highest burden of infection was with adenovirus/sapovirus (22.9%), followed by astrovirus (9.8%) and Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum (8.2%). Non-pathogenic organisms were detected in 22.5% of children. Ten percent of children had diarrhea at the time of stool collection. Infection with two or more pathogens was negatively associated with height for age z scores (- 1.34, 95% CI - 2.61 to - 0.07), as was carriage of the non-pathogen Blastocystis hominis (- 2.05, 95% CI - 3.55 to - 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Infants and toddlers living in this remote Northern Australian Aboriginal community had a high burden of enteric pathogens and non-pathogens. The association between carriage of pathogens/non-pathogens with impaired child growth in the critical first 1000 days of life has implications for healthy child growth and development and warrants further investigation. These findings have relevance for many other First Nations Communities that face many of the same challenges with regard to poverty, infections, and malnutrition.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263 and a combination of this and Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 versus simethicone in reducing the daily time spent crying in colicky infants. A multicentre randomised, open-label, parallel, controlled trial of 28 days was performed in 150 infants who were diagnosed with colic according to the Rome III criteria and who randomly received simethicone (80 mg/day; Simethicone group), B. breve CECT7263 (2x10(8) cfu/day, Bb group), or a combination of L. fermentum CECT5716 and B. breve CECT7263 (1x10(8) cfu/day per strain, Bb+Lf group). The main outcomes were minutes of crying per day and the percentage of reduction in daily crying from baseline. Data were analysed per intention to treat. All treatments significantly decreased the daily crying time at the end of the intervention (P-time <0.001). However, the infants in the Bb group had significantly decreased crying time from the first week of the study (P<0.05), whereas the Bb+Lf group and the simethicone group had significantly decreased crying time from the second week (P<0.05). The percentage of reduction in the minutes of crying from baseline in the Bb group was significantly higher than that in the Simethicone group every week of the intervention (-40.3 vs -27.6% at 1-week; -59.2 vs -43.2% at 2-weeks; -64.5 vs -53.5% at 3-week and -68.5 vs -59.5% at 4-weeks, P<0.05).

Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), the nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol measured in meconium, are potential biomarkers to quantify the level of PAE. The association between the concentrations of FAEEs from meconium and adolescent substance use and related problems was examined in a prospective birth-cohort of adolescents exposed to alcohol and drugs in utero.

Substance use problems were assessed using the Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers. Findings from multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that, after controlling for other prenatal drug exposure and covariates, higher concentrations of FAEEs (ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidonate) were related to a greater likelihood of marijuana use and experiencing substance use problems, but not tobacco or alcohol use, at age 15. Elevated levels of FAEEs in meconium may be promising markers for PAE, identifying newborns at risk for early substance use and developing substance use problems.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Caesarean section (CS) interrupts mother-to-newborn microbial transfer at birth. Beyond the neonatal period, the impact of CS on offspring gut microbiota and their short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) remains unclear. Here, we examine birth delivery mode (CS versus vaginal delivery) with the infant gut microbiota and faecal SCFAs measured 3 and 12 months after birth. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: North Carolina. POPULATION: In 2013-15, we enrolled pregnant women and followed up their offspring for 12 months. We asked a subset of participants, enrolled over a 3-month period, to provide faecal samples at the 3- and 12-month follow-up visits. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: We sequenced the 16S rRNA V4 region with Illumina MiSeq and quantified SCFA concentrations using gas chromatography. We examined delivery mode with differential abundance of microbiota amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using beta-binomial regression and faecal SCFAs using linear regression. We adjusted models for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 70 infants in our sample, 25 (36%) were delivered by CS. Compared with vaginal delivery, CS was associated with differential abundance of 14 infant bacterial ASVs at 3 months and 13 ASVs at 12 months (all FDR P < 0.05). Of note, CS infants had a higher abundance of the potential pathobionts Clostridium neonatale (P = 0.04) and Clostridium perfringens (P = 0.04) and a lower abundance of potentially beneficial Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp. (both P < 0.05) at 3 months. Other ASVs were differentially abundant at 12 months. Infants delivered by CS also had higher faecal butyrate concentration at 3 months (P < 0.005) but not at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Caesarean section was associated with increased butyrate excretion, decreased Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp., and more colonisation of the infant gut by pathobionts at 3 months of age. CS was also associated with altered gut microbiota composition, but not faecal SCFAs, at 12 months.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of all infants who were tested for drugs of abuse from May 2012 through May 2014. The primary outcome was positive infant urine or meconium drug test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors. A combined screen was created, and test characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 3,861 live births, a total of 804 infants underwent drug tests. Variables associated with having a positive infant test were (1) positive maternal urine test, (2) substance use during pregnancy, (3) </= one prenatal visit, and (4) remote substance abuse; each p-value was less than 0.0001. A model with an indicator for having at least one of these four predictors had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 69%. Application of this screen to our population would have decreased drug testing by 57%. No infants had a positive urine drug test when their mother's urine drug test was negative. CONCLUSION: This simplified screen can guide clinical decision making for determining which infants should undergo drug testing. Infant urine drug tests may not be needed when a maternal drug test result is negative. KEY POINTS: . Many common drug screening criteria are not predictive.. . Four criteria predicted positive infant drug tests.. . No infant urine drug test is needed if the mother tests negative..",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal disease primarily affecting preterm infants. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood: mother's own breast milk (MOM) is protective, possibly relating to human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) and infant gut microbiome interplay. We investigated the interaction between HMO profiles and infant gut microbiome development and its association with NEC. DESIGN: We performed HMO profiling of MOM in a large cohort of infants with NEC (n=33) with matched controls (n=37). In a subset of 48 infants (14 with NEC), we also performed longitudinal metagenomic sequencing of infant stool (n=644). RESULTS: Concentration of a single HMO, disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT), was significantly lower in MOM received by infants with NEC compared with controls. A MOM threshold level of 241 nmol/mL had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.9 for NEC. Metagenomic sequencing before NEC onset showed significantly lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher relative abundance of Enterobacter cloacae in infants with NEC. Longitudinal development of the microbiome was also impacted by low MOM DSLNT associated with reduced transition into preterm gut community types dominated by Bifidobacterium spp and typically observed in older infants. Random forest analysis combining HMO and metagenome data before disease accurately classified 87.5% of infants as healthy or having NEC. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the importance of HMOs and gut microbiome in preterm infant health and disease. The findings offer potential targets for biomarker development, disease risk stratification and novel avenues for supplements that may prevent life-threatening disease.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effect of pregnancy on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains poorly understood. We aimed to monitor intestinal inflammation using fecal calprotectin (FC) in pregnant women and their babies during early life. METHODS: Pregnant women with or without IBD and their infants were prospectively enrolled. FC levels were measured at each trimester of pregnancy and in babies throughout the first 3 years of life. Repeated-measures analysis was applied to investigate changes in FC levels while adjusting for confounders. The FC levels were correlated with the bacterial abundance in both mothers and babies. RESULTS: Six hundred and fourteen fecal samples from 358 mothers (98 with IBD) and 1005 fecal samples from 289 infants (76 born to IBD mothers) were analyzed. Pregnant Patients with IBD maintained higher FC levels through pregnancy compared with controls (P = 7.5 x 10(-54)). FC gradually increased in controls and declined in Patients with IBD throughout pregnancy (P for interaction = 5.8 x 10(-7)). Babies born to mothers with IBD presented with significantly higher FC levels than those born to controls up to 3 years of age, after adjusting for sex, delivery mode, feeding behavior, and antibiotics exposure (2 weeks to 3 months of age, P = .015; 12-36 months of age, P = .00003). Subdoligranulum, Roseburia, Fusicatenibacter, and Alistipes negatively correlated, and Streptococcus, Prevotella, Escherichia-Shigella, and Bifidobacterium positively correlated with maternal FC levels at T3. Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, and Alistipes showed negative correlations, and Streptococcus were positively correlated with FC levels within 3 months of birth. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy is associated with decreased inflammatory activity in mothers with IBD. Higher FC levels in babies born to mothers with IBD suggest subclinical inflammation in early life, the long-term consequences of which are uncertain.",

			"abstract": "The gut microbiota is a major stimulus for the immune system, and late acquisition of bacteria and/or reduced complexity of the gut flora may delay adaptive immune maturation. However, it is unknown how the gut bacterial colonization pattern in human infants is related to T cell activation during early childhood. We followed 65 Swedish children in the FARMFLORA cohort, from birth up to 3 years of age. In fecal samples collected at several time points during the first year of life, the gut colonization pattern was investigated with the use of both 16S rRNA next generation sequencing (NGS) and culture-based techniques. This was related to production of IL-13, IL-5, IL-6, TNF, IL-1beta and IFN-gamma by PHA-stimulated fresh mononuclear cells and to proportions of CD4(+) T cells that expressed CD45RO at 36 months of age. Both NGS and culture-based techniques showed that colonization by Bifidobacterium at 1 week of age associated with higher production of IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, TNF and IL-1beta at 36 months of age. By contrast, gut colonization by Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium in early infancy related inversely to induced IL-13, IL-5 and TNF at 3 years of age. Infants with elder siblings produced more cytokines and had a larger fraction of CD45RO(+) T cells compared to single children. However, controlling for these factors did not abolish the effect of colonization by Bifidobacterium on immune maturation. Thus, gut colonization in early infancy affects T cell maturation and Bifidobacterium may be especially prone to induce infantile immune maturation.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between amounts of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium and behavior in school aged children exposed to alcohol and drugs in utero. METHODS: A secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of cocaine, polydrug exposed children, primarily African-American, low socioeconomic status, recruited at birth into a longitudinal study. FAEEs were quantified with gas chromatography via a flame ionization detector. Meconium was analyzed for FAEEs for 216 newborns of whom 194 were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at ages 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Generalized estimating equation analyses were used to assess the relationship of quantity of FAEEs to outcomes, controlling for maternal psychological distress. RESULTS: Higher concentrations of FAEEs (ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate, and ethyl linolenate) were associated with caregiver reported aggressive and/or delinquent behavior at ages 10 and 12. After control for caregiver psychological distress, and age, significant (p < 0.05) FAEE by age interactions were found for ethyl myristate for aggression and for ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate and ethyl linolenate for delinquency. Thus, higher concentrations of FAEE were related to more caregiver reported aggressive and delinquent behaviors of clinical significance at ages 10 and 12. CONCLUSION: Higher concentrations of FAEEs in meconium are potential markers for children at risk for aggressive and delinquent behaviors related to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.",

C. difficile genotypes and the rate and determinants of colonization differ substantially and vary among countries and regions. A 1-year follow-up study was performed to determine the incidence, kinetics and influencing factors of C. difficile intestinal colonization. METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy infants (14 girls and 15 boys) living at home with their parents in Handan City were followed by survey from birth to 1 year of age, specifically from October 2014 through December 2015. C. difficile isolates were typed by PCR ribotyping and analyzed for the presence of toxin genes. RESULTS: During the follow-up study period in the first year of life, 20 of the 29 total enrolled infants acquired C. difficile. A total of 437 fecal samples were obtained, and 111 (25.4%) samples contained C. difficile, including 79 (71.2%) toxigenic strains. The toxigenic isolates comprised six PCR ribotypes, and two PCR ribotypes were identified as nontoxigenic strains. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that C. difficile colonization increase with age during the 12-month period, and the dominant toxigenic types of C. difficile isolates in infants were those involved in long-term colonization.

METHODS: In this study, we collected 207 faecal samples from 41 infants at 6 time points (1, 3, and 7 days and 1, 3, and 6 months after birth). The infants were assigned to four groups according to delivery mode (caesarean section (CS) or vaginal delivery (VD)) and feeding pattern (breastfeeding or formula milk). RESULTS: The meconium bacterial diversity was slightly higher in CS than in VD. Three GM patterns were identified, including Escherichia/Shigella-Streptococcus-dominated, Bifidobacterium-Escherichia/Shigella-dominated and Bifidobacterium-dominated patterns, and they gradually changed over time. In CS infants, Bifidobacterium was less abundant, and the delay in GM establishment could be partially restored by breastfeeding. The frequency of respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea consequently decreased. CONCLUSION: This study fills some gaps in the understanding of the restoration of the GM in CS towards that in VD.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to increased androgens has been suggested as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This hypothesis has been examined by measurement of steroids in amniotic fluid, cord blood, saliva, and blood with mixed results. METHODS: To provide an orthogonal measure of fetal exposure, this study used meconium, the first stool of a newborn, to measure prenatal androgen exposure from infants in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI). EARLI is a familial-enriched risk cohort that enrolled pregnant mothers who already had a child with an ASD diagnosis. In the younger child, we investigated the association between meconium unconjugated (u) and total (t) concentrations of major androgens testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenedione (A4), and ASD-related traits at 12 and 36 months of age. Traits were measured at 12 months with Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) and at 36 months with total score on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). One hundred and seventy children had meconium and AOSI, 140 had meconium and SRS, and 137 had meconium and both AOSI and SRS. RESULTS: Separate robust linear regressions between each of the log-transformed androgens and log-transformed SRS scores revealed three-way interaction between sex of the child, sex of the proband, and testosterone concentration. In the adjusted analyses, t-T, u-A4, and u-DHEA (P </= 0.01) were positively associated with AOSI scores, while u-T (P = 0.004) and u-DHEA (P = 0.007) were positively associated with SRS total score among females with female probands (n = 10). Additionally, higher concentrations of u-T (P = 0.01) and t-T (P = 0.01) predicted higher SRS total score in males with male probands (n = 63). Limitations Since we explored three-way interactions, this resulted in a limited sample size for some analyses. This study was from an enriched-risk cohort which may limit generalizability, and this study used ASD-assessment scales as outcomes instead of diagnostic categories. Additionally, the novel use of meconium in this study limits the ability to compare the results in this cohort to others due to the paucity of research on meconium. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the utility of meconium for studies of endogenous fetal metabolism and suggests the sex of older siblings with autism should be considered as a biological variable in relevant studies.",

The main objectives of this study were to determine the clonal relatedness of intestinal carriage and transmission risk factors of MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae amongst preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: A prospective cohort study of preterm infants with gestational age < 37 weeks was conducted in the NICU of the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). Infants' stool specimens were collected on day 1 (meconium), week 1, week 2, week 8 and week 10 during their admission (from 1st June to 31st August 2017) until discharge. The presence and antibiotic resistance pattern of MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae were determined. Strain clonality and relatedness were explored via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) fingerprints. The risk factors for MDR strains acquisition were evaluated using the Cox proportional-hazards model and Firth logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 139 stool specimens were obtained from 50 subjects. Twenty-six (52%) infants were colonized with MDR K. pneumoniae and/or E. coli. High clonal dissemination between two clusters of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains was seen from PFGE profile. We detected a persistent, dominant, aminoglycosides-resistant strains cluster (cluster B), which harbored bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA-1), bla(CTX-M-1), ompK35 and ompK36 genes. Infants born to women who were anemic in pregnancy [OR = 0.01 (CI = 0.00-0.39), P-value = 0.042] and infants exposed to penicillin/beta-lactams group antibiotics during the first week of life [OR = 0.02 (CI = 0.02-0.32), P-value = 0.013] were found to have a lower risk of MDR K. pneumoniae and E. coli colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of dominant aminoglycosides-resistant strains cluster in the NICU is alarming. Awareness of and vigilance for the dominant cluster found will enable the reduction of cross-transmission amongst high-risk infants.",

The genetic relationship of C. difficile strains from asymptomatic infants and adults with CA-CDI is not well defined. METHODS: In this study, 50 infants were recruited at birth, and stool samples were collected at routine well-child visits. Adult stool samples collected during the same period and geographical area from patients who were diagnosed with CA-CDI were selected for comparison. C. difficile was cultivated and probed by PCR for toxin genes and were typed by PCR fluorescent ribotyping. Isolates from adults and infants with shared ribotypes were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Of these 50 infants, 36 were positive for C. difficile at least once in their first year of life, with a peak incidence at 6 months. Among 180 infant stool samples, 48 were positive. Of 48 isolates from positive stools, 29 were toxigenic by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 8 of 48 stool samples were positive for toxin by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Ribotypes F106 and F014-020 were present in both colonized infants and adults with CA-CDI. WGS identified 1 adult-infant pair that differed by 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

STUDY DESIGN: Fecal samples were collected daily and enteral feedings were sampled weekly. MFG-E8 in enteral feedings and feces, and cytokine concentrations in feces were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Milk MFG-E8 concentrations were significantly greater in unfortified mother's own milk (MOM) and MOM with human milk fortifier than either donor human milk or preterm formula. MFG-E8 concentrations in fecal samples were positively correlated with MFG-E8 concentrations in respective milks. High MFG-E8 exposure (>/=60 mL/kg/day of feedings that include MOM or MOM with human milk fortifier) was associated with lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and higher concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-4 in feces, compared with low MFG-E8 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Infants born preterm who were fed MOM had greater concentrations of MFG-E8 and lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in fecal samples than other diets or no feedings. These data further support the protective role of MOM, possibly because of MFG-E8, against intestinal inflammation.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by watery diarrhea with a high level of fecal Cl(-), metabolic alkalosis, and electrolyte alterations. Several intestinal and extraintestinal complications and even death can occur. An optimal knowledge of the clinical features and best therapeutic strategies is mandatory for an effective management. METHODS: Articles published between 1 January 1965 and 31 December 2019, reported in PUBMED and EMBASE, were evaluated for a systematic review analyzing four categories: anamnestic features, clinical features, management, and follow-up strategies. RESULTS: Fifty-seven papers reporting information on 193 CLD patients were included. The most common anamnestic features were positive family anamnesis for chronic diarrhea (44.4%), consanguinity (75%), polyhydramnios (98.3%), preterm delivery (78.6%), and failure to pass meconium (60.7%). Mean age at diarrhea onset was 6.63 days. Median diagnostic delay was 60 days. Prenatal diagnosis, based on molecular analysis, was described in 40/172 (23.3%). All patients received NaCl/KCl-substitutive therapy. An improvement of diarrhea during adulthood was reported in 91.3% of cases. Failure to thrive (21.6%) and chronic kidney disease (17.7%) were the most common complications. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of a large population suggests the necessity of better strategies for the management of CLD. A close follow-up and a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to manage this condition characterized by heterogeneous and multisystemic complications. IMPACT: In this systematic review, we describe data regarding anamnestic features, clinical features, management, and follow-up of CLD patients obtained from the largest population of patients ever described to date. The results of our investigation could provide useful insights for the diagnostic approach and the management of this condition.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early infant feeding with intact or extensively hydrolyzed (EH) proteins or free amino acids (AA) may differentially affect intestinal microbiota composition and immune reactivity. This multicenter, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group, pilot study compared stool microbiota from Baseline (1-7 days of age) up to 60 days of age in healthy term infants who received mother's own milk (assigned to human milk [HM] reference group) (n = 25) or were randomized to receive one of two infant formulas: AA-based (AAF; n = 25) or EH cow's milk protein (EHF; n = 28). Stool samples were collected (Baseline, Day 30, Day 60) and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced. Alpha (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1) and beta diversity (Bray Curtis) were analyzed. Relative taxonomic enrichment and fold changes were analyzed (Wilcoxon, DESEq2). Short/branched chain fatty acids (S/BCFA) were quantified by gas chromatography. Mean S/BCFA and pH were analyzed (repeated measures ANOVA). RESULTS: At baseline, alpha diversity measures were similar among all groups; however, both study formula groups were significantly higher versus the HM group by Day 60. Significant group differences in beta diversity at Day 60 were also detected, and study formula groups were compositionally more similar compared to HM. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium increased over time and was significantly enriched at Day 60 in the HM group. In contrast, a significant increase in members of Firmicutes for study formula groups were detected at Day 60 along with butyrate-producing species in the EHF group. Stool pH was significantly higher in the AAF group at Days 30 and 60. Butyrate increased significantly from Baseline to Day 60 in the EHF group and was significantly higher in study formula groups vs HM at Day 60. Propionate was also significantly higher for EHF and AAF at Day 30 and AAF at Day 60 vs HM. Total and individual BCFA were higher for AAF and EHF groups vs HM through Day 60. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct patterns of early neonatal microbiome, pH, and microbial metabolites were demonstrated for infants receiving mother's own milk compared to AA-based or extensively hydrolyzed protein formula. Providing different sources of dietary protein early in life may influence gut microbiota and metabolites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02500563 . Registered July 28, 2015.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare obstetric and neonatal outcomes of deliveries complicated by meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), according to placental histology of continuous vs. acute meconium associated changes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of singleton deliveries complicated by MSAF at a single university-affiliated medical center during 2008-2018. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes were compared between cases with placental acute vs. continuous meconium exposure associated changes (columnar epithelial changes and meconium-laden macrophages, respectively). Regression analysis was used to identify independent associations with adverse neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: The medical records of 294 deliveries at our institution were reviewed, along with medical records of the neonates and the histopathological reports of their placentas. Ninety-two cases were classified as an acute placental reaction to meconium (acute exposure group) and 200 as continuous placental exposure (continuous exposure group). Patient demographics did not differ between groups. Placentas from the continuous exposure to meconium were associated with a higher rate of placental weight <10th percentile (p = 0.03) while the acute exposure group was associated with a shorter time between rupture of membranes and delivery (p = 0.02). and higher rates of non-reassuring fetal heart rate in labor (p = 0.003), and of adverse neonatal outcome (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis adverse neonatal outcome was associated with acute histologic exposure to meconium independent of background confounders (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.12-3.67). CONCLUSIONS: Acute histological changes of MSAF were independently associated with adverse neonatal outcomes as compared to continuous histologic MSAF.",

Despite their high prevalence, we have an incomplete understanding of how crAssphages shape and respond to ecological and evolutionary dynamics in the gut. Here, we report genomes of crAssphages from feces of one South African woman and three infants. Across the complete genome sequences of the South African crAssphages described here, we identify particularly elevated positive selection in RNA polymerase and phage tail protein encoding genes, contrasted against purifying selection, genome-wide. We further validate these findings against a crAssphage genome from previous studies. Together, our results suggest hotspots of selection within crAssphage RNA polymerase and phage tail protein encoding genes are potentially mediated by interactions between crAssphages and their bacterial partners.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: More than one third of the neonatal deaths at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in Debre Tabor General Hospital (DTGH) are attributable to birth asphyxia. Most of these neonates are referred from the maternity ward in the hospital. Concerns have also been raised regarding delayed intrapartum decisions for emergency obstetrics action in the hospital. However, there has been no recent scientific evidence about the exact burden of birth asphyxia and its specific determinants among live births at maternity ward of DTGH. Moreover, the public health importance of delivery time and professional mix of labor attendants haven't been addressed in the prior studies. METHODS: Hospital based cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 582 mother newborn dyads at maternity ward. Every other mother newborn dyad was included from December 2019 to March 2020. Pre-tested structured questionnaire and checklist were used for data collection. The collected data were processed and entered into Epidata version 4.2 and exported to Stata version 14. Binary logistic regressions were fitted and statistical significance was declared at p less than 0.05 with 95% CI. RESULTS: The prevalence of birth asphyxia was 28.35% [95% CI: 26.51, 35.24%]. From the final model, fetal mal-presentation (AOR = 6.96: 3.16, 15.30), premature rupture of fetal membranes (AOR = 6.30, 95% CI: 2.45, 16.22), meconium stained amniotic fluid (AOR = 7.15: 3.07, 16.66), vacuum delivery (AOR =6.21: 2.62, 14.73), night time delivery (AOR = 6.01: 2.82, 12.79) and labor attendance by medical interns alone (AOR = 3.32:1.13, 9.78) were positively associated with birth asphyxia at 95% CI. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of birth asphyxia has remained a problem of public health importance in the study setting. Therefore, the existing efforts of emergency obstetric and newborn care should be strengthened to prevent birth asphyxia from the complications of fetal mal-presentation, premature rupture of fetal membranes, meconium stained amniotic fluid and vacuum delivery. Moreover, night time deliveries and professional mixes of labor and/delivery care providers should be given more due emphasis.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The childhood period is considered to be the primary period for acquisition of the Helicobacter pylori. The high prevalence rates from developing countries are associated with gastric cancer. A decreasing trend of its prevalence has been reported from different parts of the world. Determining the prevalence rate could be important in choosing preventive strategies. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of H. pylori among a group of children from southern Iran to provide an update on the current status of the disease. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted in Shiraz, southern Iran, from January 2014 to December 2015. Four groups including neonates, children aged 6 months to 3 years, 10- and 15-year-old children were included. Multi-monoclonal stool antibody test was used for diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 436 participants, 24.8% (95% CI: 20.8-29.1) had a positive test for H. pylori: 25% in neonates (95% CI: 16.2-36.1), 22% in children aged 6 months to 3 years (95% CI: 15.2-30.2), 19.5% in the 10-year-old (95% CI: 12.3-29.4), and 29.2% in 15-year-old children (95% CI: 21-39). Sex, age, number of siblings, owning a pet, parents' smoking status, parental education, residential area, birth weight, and feeding status were not found to be statistically significant predictors of H. pylori antigen positivity (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of H. pylori was estimated to be low in southern Iran in comparison with previous reports or other developing countries. Preventive strategies with respect to low prevalence rates may be considered in the childhood period.",

			"abstract": "Phthalates are hormonally active pollutants. In-utero exposure to phthalates has been reported to be associated with birth size parameters and pregnancy outcomes. However, previous reports were inconsistent. We examined the associations between meconium exposure to phthalates and the effects on birth size parameters, pregnancy outcomes and sex and thyroid hormones in 251 mother-infant pairs from a Shanghai hospital. We measured 10 metabolites of phthalates in meconium samples collected during the first 24h after delivery. Information on seven birth size parameters (birth weight, birth length, abdominal circumference, head circumference, femur length, biparietal diameter and anogenital distance) and three pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes, premature rupture of membrane, and premature birth) was available from the birth record. Concentrations of free testosterone, estradiol (E2), thyroid stimulating hormone, concentrations of total and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were measured from cord blood. Multivariate linear regression and logistic regression were used to estimate associations between phthalate exposure and health outcomes. mono-iso-butylphthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butylphthalate (MnBP) and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP) were positively associated with birth length and femur length which seemed more obvious in female newborn; MiBP, MnBP and mono-2-ethylhexylphthalate (MEHP) were positively associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) only in mothers with male newborns; monomethyl phthalate (MMP), MiBP and MEOHP were positively associated with E2 in male newborns. This study indicates that meconium exposure to phthalates may adversely affect some fetal growth parameters and GDM with a potential gender effect.",

			"abstract": "The immediate delivery room (DR) management of non-vigorous (NV) infants with meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is controversial. A recent ILCOR suggestion is not to perform routine direct laryngoscopy (DL) with or without tracheal suctioning in NV infants. Our practice is to perform DL and endotracheal (ET) suctioning in targeted NV infants. The study objective was to describe the perinatal characteristics and DR Management of infants born through MSAF and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: Retrospective study evaluating the DR management of infants >35 weeks delivered through MSAF. Data retrieved included fetal heart rate abnormalities (FTHR), presence of thick/thin MSAF, DR management and postnatal course. RESULTS: 118 infants were resuscitated and directly admitted to the NICU, including 58 intubated for meconium, 29 receiving immediate PPV (n\u202f=\u202f25) or CPAP (n\u202f=\u202f4) and 31 (17%) initially stable developed delayed respiratory symptoms and administered CPAP. Sixty-four (35.2%) infants initially stable in the DR were subsequently admitted to NICU. ET suctioning was performed in 58/182 infants with meconium obtained in 41/58; meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) was diagnosed in 21 infants. ET suctioning was positive in 10/21 cases. FHRT abnormalities (n\u202f=\u202f50) were noted with thick meconium and associated with a 2.8-fold increased risk for meconium below the cords, and 3.1-fold increased risk of MAS. CONCLUSION: NV infants delivered through thick versus thin meconium were more likely to be intubated with a high yield of recovery. Serious pulmonary morbidity was uncommon.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral administration of probiotic bacteria to preterm neonates has been recommended to prevent the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The influence of probiotics on the endogenous microbiome, however, has remained incompletely understood. STUDY DESIGN & METHODS: Here, we performed an observational study including 80 preterm neonates born at a gestational age <32-weeks to characterize the persistence of probiotic bacteria after no treatment or oral administration of two different probiotic formula and their influence on the microbial ecosystem during and after the intervention and their association with the development of NEC. Weekly fecal samples were profiled by 16S rRNA sequencing and monitored for the presence of the probiotic bacteria by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Microbiota profiles differed significantly between the control group and both probiotic groups. Probiotic supplementation was associated with lower temporal variation as well as higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Enterobacter combined with reduced abundance of Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Klebsiella. Colonization by probiotic bifidobacteria was observed in approximately 50% of infants although it remained transient in the majority of cases. A significantly reduced monthly incidence of NEC was observed in neonates supplemented with probiotics. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate successful transient colonization by probiotic bacteria and a significant influence on the endogenous microbiota with a reduced abundance of bacterial taxa associated with the development of NEC. These results emphasize that probiotic supplementation may allow targeted manipulation of the enteric microbiota and confer a clinical benefit.

North-Eastern Spain), and to depict clinicoepidemiological features of colonized individuals. Prevalence of ESBLPE carriage amid 762 PDR (0-94 years) who had feces collected for routine culture was 7.3% and 31% among 71 NHR (68-98 years) screened upon hospital admission. The mean age of colonized and noncolonized subjects was 30 and 32.8 years in PDR (p = 0.58) and 85 and 87 years in NHR (p = 0.32). The predominant ESBLPE was CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli (42.8% in PDR and 68.2% in NHR [25% and 86.7% belonging to O25b-ST131 clone; p < 0.0001]), followed by CTX-M-9-group- and SHV-producing E. coli and by CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Overall, 72.7% of ESBLPE were multidrug resistant and 46.2% carried transferable quinolone determinants. Institutionalization in a nursing home was a risk factor for ESBLPE and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing O25b-ST131 E. coli carriage in individuals over 67 years (odds ratio 7.7 and 14.1). Previous antibiotic use and skin ulcers were significantly associated with ESBLPE carriage in NHR. Age <25 years in PDR and amoxicillin/clavulanate exposure in NHR protected against ESBL-producing O25b-ST131 E. coli colonization. Only two PDR, with known risk factors, bore OXA-48-producing isolates. These results highlight the role of nonhospitalized intestinal carriers, particularly NHR, as ESBLPE reservoirs and the preponderance of CTX-M-15, mainly linked to O25b-ST131 clone, as well as the emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales carriers.",

However, among normal fetuses the average baseline heart rate has been shown to diminish progressively and the 90th centile of the fetal heart rate at 40 weeks of gestation has been consistently found at around 150 bpm. The aim of our study was to assess the labor and neonatal outcome of fetuses at 40 gestational weeks or beyond, whose intrapartum baseline fetal heart rate was between 150 and 160 bpm. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including singleton pregnancies with spontaneous onset of labor, gestational age between 40(+0) and 42(+0) weeks, category I CTG trace according to the FIGO guidelines 2015 with baseline fetal heart rate between 110 and 160 bpm during the first 60 minutes of active labor. Exclusion criteria were maternal hyperpyrexia at admission, fetal arrhythmias, maternal tachycardia (>110 bpm) and uterine tachysystole (>5 contractions/10 minutes). The following outcomes were compared between fetuses with a baseline ranging between 110 and 149 bpm and those with a baseline ranging between 150 and 160 bpm: incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, intrapartum hyperpyrexia, mode of delivery, Apgar at 5 minutes <7, arterial pH <7.1 and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission, incidence of a composite adverse neonatal outcome. RESULTS: In all, 1004 CTG traces were included in the analysis, 860 in Group 110-149 bpm and 144 in Group 150-160 bpm. Group 150-160 bpm had a significantly higher incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (odds ratio [OR] 2.6; 95% CI 1.8-3.8), maternal intrapartum hyperpyrexia (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.1-14.6), urgent/emergent cesarean section for suspected fetal distress (OR 13.4; 95% CI 3.3-54.3), Apgar <7 at 5th min (OR 9.13; 95% CI 1.5-55.1) and neonatal acidemia (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.5-55.1). Logistic regression including adjustiing for potential confounders showed that fetal heart rate between 150 and 160 bpm is an independent predictor of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.2; 95% CI 1.5-3.3), cesarean section during labor for fetal distress (aOR 10.7; 95% CI 2.9-44.6), neonatal acidemia (aOR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.7) and adverse composite neonatal outcome (aOR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.6).

At the moment, there are no reports showing the epidemiological status of this region that would allow to establish methods for prevention and control of these infections and to indicate of the prevalent pathogen that produces them. Therefore we carried out an epidemiological study of the gastroenteritis etiological agents and their incidence in the pediatric population. A total of 17 823 fecal samples were collected, 14 242 from HNJ-Tuc, 2,257 from CePSI-Stgo and 1,324 from HINEP-Cat. In 2,595 samples a bacterial agent was identified, the 93.64% corresponded to Shigella/Salmonella clinical isolates. Shigella genus was the prevalent pathogen, being Shigella flexneri 2 the most frequent serotype. Most of the Shigella clinical isolates presented themselves as multidrug-resistant (MDR), harboring 2 to 3 genetic resistance determinants. 50% of the affected patients were children under 4 years old. Here, we demonstrate that bacterial gastrointestinal diseases strongly affect the health of NWA population. The appearance of epidemic outbreaks, as happened during 2014, suggest that they may be related to the socio-economic poverty of NWA. Recently, Shigella flexneri 2 has become the highest NWA s incidence infectious agent. The acquisition of new antibiotic resistance determinants may play an important role in their adaptation and persistence.",

			"abstract": "Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (Salmonella Enteritidis) is a major cause of foodborne disease outbreaks worldwide. In 2018, two concurrent outbreaks of Salmonella Enteritidis gastroenteritis in one district of South Africa were investigated. We describe the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of bacterial isolates to assist with the investigation of these outbreaks. Outbreak A affected children (n=27) attending a day-care centre, while outbreak B affected adults (n=16) who ate breakfast at the same restaurant. Salmonella Enteritidis was isolated from stool samples in both outbreaks (four children in outbreak A; 12 restaurant customers and three restaurant food-handlers in outbreak B). In outbreak B, Salmonella Enteritidis was isolated from three food retention samples (raw chicken egg, hollandaise sauce and rocket-herb). Available isolates from both outbreaks (n=13) were investigated using WGS analysis. Sequencing data for isolates were analysed at the EnteroBase web-based platform and included core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST). Isolates with epidemiological links to the restaurant (n=10) and day-care centre (n=3), were shown by cgMLST to be highly genetically related, with no more than five allele differences when comparing one isolate against another. On food history, eggs and hollandaise sauce were the common food items consumed by ill restaurant customers. Unfortunately, Salmonella Enteritidis isolated from the egg and hollandaise sauce were not available for WGS analysis. Our investigation concluded that the two concurrent outbreaks were caused by a highly related strain of Salmonella Enteritidis, suggesting the possibility of a common contaminated food source, of which contaminated eggs are strongly implicated.",

			"abstract": "The first months of life represent a crucial time period for an infant. Alongside establishing the early microbiome, the mucosal immunological homeostasis is being developed. Both processes may be perturbed in prematurely born infants. The glycoprotein SALSA plays a role in mucosal inflammation and microbial clearance. It is one of the most abundant molecules on the intestinal mucosal surfaces in early life. SALSA binds to many types of microbes and host defence molecules like IgA, C1q and collectin molecules. We here describe the development in faecal SALSA levels during the first three months of life. During these 90 days, the median SALSA level in full-term babies decreased from 1100 mug/mL (range 49-17 000 mug/mL) to 450 mug/mL (range 33-1000 mug/mL). Lower levels of SALSA were observed in prematurely born infants in the same time period. Our novel observation thus indicates an impact of prematurity on an important component of the infant intestinal immune system. Changes in SALSA in early life may have an effect on the early establishment of the human microbiome.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS) is widely considered the gold standard of quantitative fecal VOC analysis. However, guidelines providing general recommendations for bioanalytical method application in research and clinical setting are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To propose an evidence-based research protocol for fecal VOC analysis by HS-GC-MS, based on extensive testing of instrumental and sampling conditions on detection and quantification limits, linearity, accuracy and repeatability of VOC outcome. METHODS: The influence of the following variables were assessed: addition of different salt solutions, injection temperature, injection speed, injection volume, septum use, use of calibration curves and fecal sample mass. Ultimately, the optimal sample preparation was assessed using fecal samples from healthy preterm infants. Fecal VOC analysis in this specific population has potential as diagnostic biomarkers, but available amount of feces is limited here, so optimization of VOC extraction is of importance. RESULTS: We demonstrated that addition of lithium chloride enhanced the release of polar compounds (e.g. small alcohols) into the headspace. Second, a linear relationship between injection volume, speed and temperature, and fecal sample mass on the abundance of VOC was demonstrated. Furthermore, the use of a septum preserved 90% of the non-polar compounds. By application of optimal instrumental and sampling conditions, a maximum of 320 unique compounds consisting of 14 different chemical classes could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may contribute to standardized analysis of fecal VOC by HS-GC-MS, facilitating future application of fecal VOC in clinical practice.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: From 2016, the Government of India introduced the oral rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization schedule. Currently, two indigenously developed vaccines (ROTAVAC, Bharat Biotech; ROTASIIL, Serum Institute of India) are included in the Indian immunization program. We report the rotavirus disease burden and the diversity of rotavirus genotypes from 2005 to 2016 in a multi-centric surveillance study before the introduction of vaccines. METHODS: A total of 29,561 stool samples collected from 2005 to 2016 (7 sites during 2005-2009, 3 sites from 2009 to 2012, and 28 sites during 2012-2016) were included in the analysis. Stools were tested for rotavirus antigen using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Genotyping was performed on 65.8% of the EIA positive samples using reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify the G (VP7) and P (VP4) types. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the odds of detecting genotypes across the surveillance period and in particular age groups. RESULTS: Of the 29,561 samples tested, 10,959 (37.1%) were positive for rotavirus. There was a peak in rotavirus positivity during December to February across all sites. Of the 7215 genotyped samples, G1P[8] (38.7%) was the most common, followed by G2P[4] (12.3%), G9P[4] (5.8%), G12P[6] (4.2%), G9P[8] (4%), and G12P[8] (2.4%). Globally, G9P[4] and G12P[6] are less common genotypes, although these genotypes have been reported from India and few other countries. There was a variation in the geographic and temporal distribution of genotypes, and the emergence or re-emergence of new genotypes such as G3P[8] was seen. Over the surveillance period, there was a decline in the proportion of G2P[4], and an increase in the proportion of G9P[4]. A higher proportion of mixed and partially typed/untyped samples was also seen more in the age group 0-11 months. CONCLUSIONS: This 11 years surveillance highlights the high burden of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in Indian children < 5 years of age before inclusion of rotavirus vaccines in the national programme. Regional variations in rotavirus epidemiology were seen, including the emergence of G3P[8] in the latter part of the surveillance. Having pre-introduction data is important to track changing epidemiology of rotaviruses, particularly following vaccine introduction.",

			"abstract": "Evidence is accumulating that the establishment of the gut microbiome in early life influences the development of atopic eczema. In this longitudinal study, we used integrated multi-omics analyses to infer functional mechanisms by which the microbiome modulates atopic eczema risk. We measured the functionality of the gut microbiome and metabolome of 63 infants between ages 3 weeks and 12 months with well-defined eczema cases and controls in a sub-cohort from the Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) mother-offspring cohort. At 3 weeks, the microbiome and metabolome of allergen-sensitized atopic eczema infants were characterized by an enrichment of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, associated with increased stool D-glucose concentration and increased gene expression of associated virulence factors. A delayed colonization by beneficial Bacteroides fragilis and subsequent delayed accumulation of butyrate and propionate producers after 3 months was also observed. Here, we describe an aberrant developmental trajectory of the gut microbiome and stool metabolome in allergen sensitized atopic eczema infants. The infographic describes an impaired developmental trajectory of the gut microbiome and metabolome in allergen-sensitized atopic eczema (AE) infants and infer its contribution in modulating allergy risk in the Singaporean mother-offspring GUSTO cohort. The key microbial signature of AE is characterized by (1) an enrichment of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae which are associated with accumulation of pre-glycolysis intermediates (D-glucose) via the trehalose metabolic pathway, increased gene expression of associated virulence factors (invasin, adhesin, flagellin and lipopolysaccharides) by utilizing ATP from oxidative phosphorylation and delayed production of butyrate and propionate, (2) depletion of Bacteroides fragilis which resulted in lower expression of immunostimulatory bacterial cell envelope structure and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis pathway, and (3) accompanied depletion of bacterial groups with the ability to derive butyrate and propionate through direct or indirect pathways which collectively resulted in reduced glycolysis, butyrate and propionate biosynthesis.",

T-Hg can cross the blood-brain and placental barriers, and may be associated with future neurological and physiological dysfunctions. Scalp hair is an optimal and non-invasive indicator of chronic T-Hg exposure. As part of the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, hair samples from 350 women were collected within weeks after giving birth, to determine temporal variations in T-Hg levels from preconception to delivery, and to compare these levels to corresponding levels measured in other matrices (maternal and umbilical cord blood, and infant's meconium). A maximum of 12 one-cm hair segments were cut starting at the scalp; segments closer to the scalp reflected recent exposure (within the last month). For proper comparison, the hair segments were matched with the collection dates for other matrices. GM hair T-Hg levels greatly decreased during pregnancy, from 0.26 mug g(-1) (preconception or full-length hair) to 0.18 mug g(-1) (at delivery or segments closer to the scalp). A similar decreasing trend was found for T-Hg in maternal blood: 1st trimester (0.60 mug L(-1)) to 3rd trimester (0.47 mug L(-1)). The median hair-to-blood ratios of T-Hg levels varied from 364 (1st trimester), to 408 (3rd trimester), to 229 (cord blood). Very low T-Hg levels were detected in meconium. Mercury levels in blood and hair correlated with consumption of large predatory fish.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is considered a risk factor for child development; however, child biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure have been rarely studied. We examined whether a meconium alcohol metabolite (ethyl glucuronide, EtG) was associated with child cortisol concentrations at primary school age. METHODS: For 137 children, prenatal alcohol exposure was operationalized by the meconium biomarker EtG and by maternal self-reports during pregnancy. Two EtG cut-offs (EtG >/=10 ng/g and EtG >/=112 ng/g) were applied. Cortisol concentrations were measured in saliva and hair samples. RESULTS: Children with EtG >/=10 ng/g showed significantly reduced hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) (p = .050, etap2  = 0.042). For children with EtG >/=112 ng/g, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) was significantly decreased (p = .025, etap2  = 0.070). These effects were also present in correlational analyses with continuous EtG data, speaking for partly dose-dependent effects. Especially, within the EtG >/=112 ng/g group, the basal (CAR: r(p)  = -.642, p = .120) and cumulative (HCC: r(p)  = -.660, p = .107) cortisol parameters were associated with child emotional symptoms at medium effect size. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed both the biological association of intrauterine alcohol exposure with the cortisol stress system, partly dose-dependent, and the functional association with emotional and behavioral symptoms.",

In this study (NCT03568734), we evaluated whether disturbed intestinal microbiota development could be restored in term CS-born infants by postnatal, orally delivered fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We recruited 17 mothers, of whom seven were selected after careful screening. Their infants received a diluted fecal sample from their own mothers, taken 3 weeks prior to delivery. All seven infants had an uneventful clinical course during the 3-month follow-up and showed no adverse effects. The temporal development of the fecal microbiota composition of FMT-treated CS-born infants no longer resembled that of untreated CS-born infants but showed significant similarity to that of vaginally born infants. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the intestinal microbiota of CS-born infants can be restored postnatally by maternal FMT.

The present study highlights, clinical, epidemiological, and molecular aspects with respect to RVA, NoV, enterovirus (EV), and human parechovirus (HPeVs) in sporadic cases (n = 305) of acute gastroenteritis, Pune (Maharashtra), Western India. Detection of RVA was carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, NoV, EV, and HPeVs by reverse transcription PCR. Prevalence of 36.06%, 20.32%, 14.09%, 3.93%, respectively was observed for RVA, EV, HPeVs, and NoV along with coinfections. Infections occurred in children less than 2 years old, with peak infections within 12 months age. The disease severity in RV infections was found high (70.90%) with severe disease, followed by EV (62.9%), NoV (58.33%), and HPeV (44.58%). Predominant strains of RV G1P[8], G2P[4] types with unusual G9P[4], NoV Genogroup II of genotype 4 strains and multiple EV types with EV-B species, E14 and E17 and two novel EV-75, EV-107 types were detected.

			"article_name": "Association of Prenatal Acetaminophen Exposure Measured in Meconium With Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Mediated by Frontoparietal Network Brain Connectivity.",
			"abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Despite evidence of an association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring, the drug is not contraindicated during pregnancy, possibly because prior studies have relied on maternal self-report, failed to quantify acetaminophen dose, and lacked mechanistic insight. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure measured in meconium (hereinafter referred to as meconium acetaminophen) and ADHD in children aged 6 to 7 years, along with the potential for mediation by functional brain connectivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective birth cohort study from the Centre Hospitalier Universite de Sherbrooke in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, included 394 eligible children, of whom 345 had meconium samples collected at delivery and information on ADHD diagnosis. Mothers were enrolled from September 25, 2007, to September 10, 2009, at their first prenatal care visit or delivery and were followed up when children were aged 6 to 7 years. When children were aged 9 to 11 years, resting-state brain connectivity was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. Data for the present study were collected from September 25, 2007, to January 18, 2020, and analyzed from January 7, 2019, to January 22, 2020. EXPOSURES: Acetaminophen levels measured in meconium. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physician diagnosis of ADHD was determined at follow-up when children were aged 6 to 7 years or from medical records. Resting-state brain connectivity was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging; attention problems and hyperactivity were assessed with the Behavioral Assessment System for Children Parent Report Scale. Associations between meconium acetaminophen levels and outcomes were estimated with linear and logistic regressions weighted on the inverse probability of treatment to account for potential confounders. Causal mediation analysis was used to test for mediation of the association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and hyperactivity by resting-state brain connectivity. RESULTS: Among the 345 children included in the analysis (177 boys [51.3%]; mean [SD] age, 6.58 [0.54] years), acetaminophen was detected in 199 meconium samples (57.7%), and ADHD was diagnosed in 33 children (9.6%). Compared with no acetaminophen, detection of acetaminophen in meconium was associated with increased odds of ADHD (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95% CI, 1.41-4.21). A dose-response association was detected; each doubling of exposure increased the odds of ADHD by 10% (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19). Children with acetaminophen detected in meconium showed increased negative connectivity between frontoparietal and default mode network nodes to clusters in the sensorimotor cortices, which mediated an indirect effect on increased child hyperactivity (14%; 95% CI, 1%-26%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Together with the multitude of other cohort studies showing adverse neurodevelopment associated with prenatal acetaminophen exposure, this work suggests caution should be used in administering acetaminophen during pregnancy. Research into alternative pain management strategies for pregnant women could be beneficial.",

			"abstract": "The mortality rate of very preterm infants with birth weight <1500 g is as high as 15%. The survivors till discharge have a high incidence of significant morbidity, which includes necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS). More than 25% of preterm births are associated with microbial invasion of amniotic cavity. The preterm gut microbiome subsequently undergoes an early disruption before achieving bacterial maturation. It is postulated that bacterial gut colonisation at birth and postnatal intestinal dysbacteriosis precede the development of NEC and LONS in very preterm infants. In fact, bacterial colonization patterns in preterm infants greatly differ from term infants due to maternal chorioamnionitis, gestational age, delivery method, feeding type, antibiotic exposure and the environment factor in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In this regard, this review provides an overview on the gut bacteria in preterm neonates' meconium and stool. More than 50% of preterm meconium contains bacteria and the proportion increases with lower gestational age. Researchers revealed that the gut bacterial diversity is reduced in preterm infants at risk for LONS and NEC. Nevertheless, the association between gut dysbacteriosis and NEC is inconclusive with regards to relative bacteria abundance and between-sample beta diversity indices. With most studies show a disruption of the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes preceding the NEC. Hence, this review sheds light on whether gut bacteria at birth either alone or in combination with postnatal gut dysbacteriosis are associated with mortality and the morbidity of LONS and NEC in very preterm infants.",

			"abstract": "Alterations in the gut microbiota composition and diversity seem to play a role in the development of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), leading to gut barrier disruption and induction of proinflammatory immune responses. This opens the door for the use of novel health-promoting bacteria. We selected five Parabacteroides distasonis strains isolated from human adult and neonates gut microbiota. We evaluated in vitro their immunomodulation capacities and their ability to reinforce the gut barrier and characterized in vivo their protective effects in an acute murine model of colitis. The in vitro beneficial activities were highly strain dependent: two strains exhibited a potent anti-inflammatory potential and restored the gut barrier while a third strain reinstated the epithelial barrier. While their survival to in vitro gastric conditions was variable, the levels of P. distasonis DNA were higher in the stools of bacteria-treated animals. The strains that were positively scored in vitro displayed a strong ability to rescue mice from colitis. We further showed that two strains primed dendritic cells to induce regulatory T lymphocytes from naive CD4(+) T cells. This study provides better insights on the functionality of commensal bacteria and crucial clues to design live biotherapeutics able to target inflammatory chronic diseases such as IBD.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enterobacter cloacae species is responsible for nosocomial outbreaks in vulnerable patients in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The environment can constitute the reservoir and source of infection in NICUs. Herein we report the impact of preventive measures implemented after an Enterobacter cloacae outbreak inside a NICU. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in one level 3 NICU in Lyon, France, over a 6 year-period (2012-2018). After an outbreak of Enterobacter cloacae infections in hospitalized neonates in 2013, several measures were implemented including intensive biocleaning and education of medical staff. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of infected patients and evolution of colonization/infection with Enterobacter spp. in this NICU were retrieved. Moreover, whole genome sequencing was performed on 6 outbreak strains. RESULTS: Enterobacter spp. was isolated in 469 patients and 30 patients developed an infection including 2 meningitis and 12 fatal cases. Preventive measures and education of medical staff were not associated with a significant decrease in patient colonisation but led to a persistent decreased use of cephalosporin in the NICU. Infection strains were genetically diverse, supporting the hypothesis of multiple hygiene defects rather than the diffusion of a single clone. CONCLUSIONS: Grouped cases of infections inside one setting are not necessarily related to a single-clone outbreak and could reveal other environmental and organisational problematics. The fight against implementation and transmission of Enterobacter spp. in NICUs remains a major challenge.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify exposure pathways to fecal pathogens that are significant contributors to diarrheal diseases and impaired growth in young children, and to evaluate scalable interventions to reduce fecal contamination from these pathways. STUDY DESIGN: Reducing Enteropathy, Undernutrition, and Contamination in the Environment (REDUCE) was a prospective cohort study of 370 children <5 years of age was conducted in Walungu Territory, South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Child mouthing behaviors were assessed through caregiver reports and 5-hour structured observations. Caregiver reports of child contact with animals and child diarrhea were also obtained. Anthropometric measurements were collected at baseline and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Children observed putting soil in their mouth during structured observation at baseline had a significantly higher odds of diarrhea at the 6-month follow-up (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.07). Children observed mouthing feces during structured observation had a significant reduction in height-for-age z-score (HAZ) from baseline to the 6-month follow-up (DeltaHAZ, -0.69; 95% CI, -1.34 to -0.04). A significant reduction in HAZ was also observed for children with caregiver reports of touching guinea pigs (-0.33; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.08) and rabbits (-0.34; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.04) and children with feces in their sleeping space during unannounced spot checks (-0.41; 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.09). CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the urgent need for infant water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions targeting child mouthing behaviors, fecal contamination in child living spaces, and child contact with domestic animals to reduce exposure to fecal pathogens among susceptible populations.",

			"abstract": "Supplementation with members of the early-life microbiota as \"probiotics\" is increasingly used in attempts to beneficially manipulate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We performed a large observational longitudinal study comprising two preterm groups: 101 infants orally supplemented with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (Bif/Lacto) and 133 infants non-supplemented (control) matched by age, sex, and delivery method. 16S rRNA gene profiling on fecal samples (n = 592) showed a predominance of Bifidobacterium and a lower abundance of pathobionts in the Bif/Lacto group. Metabolomic analysis showed higher fecal acetate and lactate and a lower fecal pH in the Bif/Lacto group compared to the control group. Fecal acetate positively correlated with relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, consistent with the ability of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strain to metabolize human milk oligosaccharides into acetate. This study demonstrates that microbiota supplementation is associated with a Bifidobacterium-dominated preterm microbiota and gastrointestinal environment more closely resembling that of full-term infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotaviruses are primary etiological agents of gastroenteritis in young children. In Kenya, G1P8 monovalent vaccine (Rotarix) was introduced in July 2014 for mandatory vaccination of all newborns at 6 and 10 weeks of age. Since then, no studies have been done to identify the rotavirus genotypes circulating in Nairobi County, Kenya, following the vaccine introduction, hence the post-vaccine genotype distribution is not known. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the post-vaccine occurrence of rotavirus genotypes in children <5 years of age in Nairobi County, Kenya. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children presenting with diarrhea for whom the vaccination status was card-confirmed. Fecal samples were analyzed for rotavirus antigen using a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit, followed by characterization by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, RT-PCR, and nested PCR genotyping, targeting the most medically important genotypes. RESULTS: The strains observed included G1P[8] (38.8%), G9P[8] (20.4%), G2P[4] (12.2%), G3[P4] (6.1%), G2P[6] (4.1%), and G9P[6] (4.1%). Mixed genotype constellations G3P[4][8] were also detected (4.1%). Remarkably, an increased prevalence of G2 genotypes was observed, revealing a change in genetic diversity of rotavirus strains. While the dominance of G1P[8] decreased after vaccination, an upsurge in G2P[4] (12.2%) and G9P[8] (20.4%) was observed. Additionally, G3[P4] (6.1%) and G2P[6] (4.1%) prevalence increased over the 3 years of study. CONCLUSIONS: The results inform the need for robust longitudinal surveillance and epidemiological studies to assess the long-term interaction between rotavirus vaccine and strain ecology.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) are among the leading pathogens associated with endemic diarrhea in low income countries. Yet, few epidemiological studies have focused the contribution of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC). METHODS: We assessed the contribution of EHEC, EIEC and DAEC isolated from stool samples from a case-control study conducted in children aged < 5 years in Southern Mozambique between December 2007 and November 2012. The isolates were screened by conventional PCR targeting stx1 and stx2 (EHEC), ial and ipaH (EIEC), and daaE (DAEC) genes. RESULTS: We analyzed 297 samples from cases with less-severe diarrhea (LSD) matched to 297 controls, and 89 samples from cases with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) matched to 222 controls, collected between November 3, 2011 and November 2, 2012. DEC were more common among LSD cases (2.7%, [8/297] of cases vs. 1.3% [4/297] of controls; p = 0.243]) than in MSD cases (0%, [0/89] of cases vs. 0.4%, [1/222] of controls; p = 1.000). Detailed analysis revealed low frequency of EHEC, DAEC or EIEC and no association with diarrhea in all age strata. Although the low frequency, EIEC was predominant in LSD cases aged 24-59 months (4.1% for cases vs. 0% for controls), followed by DAEC in similar frequency for cases and controls in infants (1.9%) and lastly EHEC from one control. Analysis of a subset of samples from previous period (December 10, 2007 and October 31, 2011) showed high frequency of DEC in controls compared to MSD cases (16.2%, [25/154] vs. 11.9%, [14/118], p = 0.383, respectively). Among these, DAEC predominated, being detected in 7.7% of cases vs. 17.6% of controls aged 24-59 months, followed by EIEC in 7.7% of cases vs. 5.9% of controls for the same age category, although no association was observed. EHEC was detected in one sample from cases and two from controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that although EHEC, DAEC and EIEC are less frequent in endemic diarrhea in rural Mozambique, attention should be given to their transmission dynamics (e.g. the role on sporadic or epidemic diarrhea) considering that the role of asymptomatic individuals as source of dissemination remains unknown.",

Breastfed newborns diagnosed with BMJ and those without BMJ (control group) were enrolled. Faecal samples were collected from the participants and subjected to high-throughput sequencing of the 16s rDNA V3 and V4 regions of the gut flora and metabolomics of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Proteobacteria, Fimicutes and Actinobacteria were the main bacteria at the phylum level. Eshcerichia-Shigella and Enterobacteriacea were the main bacteria at the genus level. The difference between the two groups was compared. Compared to the control group, the amount of Streptococcus was significantly increased while the amount of Enterococcus was significantly decreased in the faeces from infants with BMJ. Functional prediction analysis of 16S found that biosynthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin significantly increased in the BMJ group. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detection of SCFAs revealed that levels of acetic acid and propionic acid were significantly lower in the BMJ group than in the control group. The reduced levels of acetic acid and propionic acid may be related to the increase in Streptococcus and decrease in Enterococcus, both of which may contribute to BMJ.",

			"abstract": "Infant formula feeding, compared with human milk, has been associated with development of a distinct infant gut microbiome, but no previous study has examined effects of formula with added sugars. This work examined differences in gut microbiota among 91 Hispanic infants who consumed human milk [at breast (BB) vs. pumped in bottle (BP)] and 2 kinds of infant formula [(traditional lactose-based (TF) vs. lactose-reduced with added sugar (ASF)]. At 1 and 6 months, infant stool was collected to characterize gut microbiota. At 6 months, mothers completed 24-hour dietary recalls and questionnaires to determine infant consumption of human milk (BB vs. BP) or formula (TF vs. ASF). Linear regression models were used to determine associations of milk consumption type and microbial features at 6 months. Infants in the formula groups exhibited a significantly more 'mature' microbiome than infants in the human milk groups with the most pronounced differences observed between the ASF vs. BB groups. In the ASF group, we observed reduced log-normalized abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae (TF-BB Mean Difference = -0.71, ASF-BB Mean Difference = -1.10), and increased abundance of Lachnospiraceae (TF-BB Mean Difference = +0.89, ASF-BB Mean Difference = +1.20). We also observed a higher Community Phenotype Index of propionate, most likely produced by Lachnospiraceae, in the ASF group (TF-BB Mean Difference = +0.27, ASF-BB Mean Difference = +0.36). This study provides the first evidence that consumption of infant formula with added sugar may have a stronger association than birth delivery mode, infant caloric intake, and maternal BMI on the infant's microbiome at 6 months of age.",

			"abstract": "One of the many challenges with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains our inability to make an accurate diagnosis of NEC. The lack of a unifying cause and multiple variations in presentations lead to great uncertainty with NEC. Separating out the needs of the researcher wanting to define NEC from the clinician and patient family's perspectives who want an accurate diagnosis for NEC is important. The need to augment and/or replace the outdated modified Bell staging criteria is crucial to improving NEC management. Emerging literature suggests that genetic susceptibility and stool microbiota signatures may help identify preterm infants at increased risk of the disease. Ongoing studies using single or multi-omic approaches may help to characterize biomarkers that will aid in the prediction or early diagnosis of NEC, as well as differentiate other causes of severe bowel injury. Bowel ultrasound shows promise in improving our diagnostic accuracy for NEC but has been slow in adoption.

Scant data are available on rates of travel-acquired ETEC producing heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) toxin or its subtypes, STh (human) and STp (porcine) in various geographic regions, and on clinical pictures associated with each toxin. METHODS: Using qPCR, we analysed LT, STh, and STp in stools positive for ETEC in a prospective study among 103 Finnish travellers visiting LMIC. They filled in questionnaires and provided stool samples before and after travel. We scrutinized geographic distribution of LT, STh, and STp ETEC findings, and association between these different ETEC subtypes and moderate/severe TD. RESULTS: Among the 103 stool samples positive for ETEC toxins, the rate for LT was 76%, for STh 26%, and STp 41%. The rate for LT-only was 44%, for STh-only 6%, STp-only 16%, LT + STh 10%, LT + STp 15%, STh + STp 3%, and LT + STh + STp 8%. Findings varied by destination; the rates of LT, STh, and STp were 79%, 21%, and 57%, respectively, in Southern Asia (n = 14); 85%, 10%, and 20% in South-eastern Asia (n = 20); 84%, 13%, and 29% in Eastern Africa (n = 31); and 56%, 50%, and 63% in Western Africa (n = 32), respectively. Of travellers positive for LT, STh, and STp, 83%, 100%, and 88%, encountered TD; 35%, 55%, and 41% reported moderate/severe TD. STh was associated with moderate/severe TD.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The poliovirus has been targeted for eradication since 1988. Kenya reported its last case of indigenous Wild Poliovirus (WPV) in 1984 but suffered from an outbreak of circulating Vaccine-derived Poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in 2018. We aimed to describe Kenya's polio surveillance performance 2016-2018 using WHO recommended polio surveillance standards. METHODS: Retrospective secondary data analysis was conducted using Kenyan AFP surveillance case-based database from 2016 to 2018. Analyses were carried out using Epi-Info statistical software (version 7) and mapping was done using Quantum Geographic Information System (GIS) (version 3.4.1). RESULTS: Kenya reported 1706 cases of AFP from 2016 to 2018. None of the cases were confirmed as poliomyelitis. However, 23 (1.35%) were classified as polio compatible. Children under 5 years accounted for 1085 (63.6%) cases, 937 (55.0%) cases were boys, and 1503 (88.1%) cases had received three or more doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). AFP detection rate substantially increased over the years; however, the prolonged health workers strike in 2017 negatively affected key surveillance activities. The mean Non-Polio (NP-AFP) rate during the study period was 2.87/ 100,000 children under 15 years, and two adequate specimens were collected for 1512 (88.6%) AFP cases. Cumulatively, 31 (66.0%) counties surpassed target for both WHO recommended AFP quality indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of Kenya's AFP surveillance system surpassed the minimum WHO recommended targets for both non-polio AFP rate and stool adequacy during the period studied. In order to strengthen the country's polio free status, health worker's awareness on AFP surveillance and active case search should be strengthened in least performing counties to improve case detection. Similar analyses should be done at the sub-county level to uncover underperformance that might have been hidden by county level analysis.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: After birth, the immune system matures via interactions with microbes in the gut. The S100 calcium binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9, and their extracellular complex form, S100A8-A9, are found in high amounts in human breast milk. We studied levels of S100A8-A9 in fecal samples (also called fecal calprotectin) from newborns and during infancy, and their effects on development of the intestinal microbiota and mucosal immune system. METHODS: We collected stool samples (n = 517) from full-term (n = 72) and preterm infants (n = 49) at different timepoints over the first year of life (days 1, 3, 10, 30, 90, 180, and 360). We measured levels of S100A8-A9 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and analyzed fecal microbiomes by 16S sRNA gene sequencing. We also obtained small and large intestine biopsies from 8 adults and 10 newborn infants without inflammatory bowel diseases (controls) and 8 infants with necrotizing enterocolitis and measured levels of S100A8 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Children were followed for 2.5 years and anthropometric data and medical information on infections were collected. We performed studies with newborn C57BL/6J wild-type and S100a9(-/-) mice (which also lack S100A8). Some mice were fed or given intraperitoneal injections of S100A8 or subcutaneous injections of Staphylococcus aureus. Blood and intestine, mesenterial and celiac lymph nodes were collected; cells and cytokines were measured by flow cytometry and studied in cell culture assays. Colon contents from mice were analyzed by culture-based microbiology assays. RESULTS: Loss of S100A8 and S100A9 in mice altered the phenotypes of colonic lamina propria macrophages, compared with wild-type mice. Intestinal tissues from neonatal S100-knockout mice had reduced levels of CX3CR1 protein, and Il10 and Tgfb1 mRNAs, compared with wild-type mice, and fewer T-regulatory cells. S100-knockout mice weighed 21% more than wild-type mice at age 8 weeks and a higher proportion developed fatal sepsis during the neonatal period. S100-knockout mice had alterations in their fecal microbiomes, with higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Feeding mice S100 at birth prevented the expansion of Enterobacteriaceae, increased numbers of T-regulatory cells and levels of CX3CR1 protein and Il10 mRNA in intestine tissues, and reduced body weight and death from neonatal sepsis. Fecal samples from term infants, but not preterm infants, had significantly higher levels of S100A8-A9 during the first 3 months of life than fecal samples from adults; levels decreased to adult levels after weaning. Fecal samples from infants born by cesarean delivery had lower levels of S100A8-A9 than from infants born by vaginal delivery. S100 proteins were expressed by lamina propria macrophages in intestinal tissues from infants, at higher levels than in intestinal tissues from adults. High fecal levels of S100 proteins, from 30 days to 1 year of age, were associated with higher abundance of Actinobacteria and Bifidobacteriaceae, and lower abundance of Gammaproteobacteria-particularly opportunistic Enterobacteriaceae. A low level of S100 proteins in infants' fecal samples associated with development of sepsis and obesity by age 2 years. CONCLUSION: S100A8 and S100A9 regulate development of the intestinal microbiota and immune system in neonates. Nutritional supplementation with these proteins might aide in development of preterm infants and prevent microbiota-associated disorders in later years.",

We further characterized the epidemiology of Shigella in the first two years of life in a multisite birth cohort. We tested 41,405 diarrheal and monthly non-diarrheal stools from 1,715 children for Shigella by quantitative PCR. To assess risk factors, clinical factors related to age and culture positivity, and associations with inflammatory biomarkers, we used log-binomial regression with generalized estimating equations. The prevalence of Shigella varied from 4.9%-17.8% in non-diarrheal stools across sites, and the incidence of Shigella-attributable diarrhea was 31.8 cases (95% CI: 29.6, 34.2) per 100 child-years. The sensitivity of culture compared to qPCR was 6.6% and increased to 27.8% in Shigella-attributable dysentery. Shigella diarrhea episodes were more likely to be severe and less likely to be culture positive in younger children. Older age (RR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.70, 1.81 per 6-month increase in age), unimproved sanitation (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.29), low maternal education (<10 years, RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.26), initiating complementary foods before 3 months (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.20), and malnutrition (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.95 per unit increase in weight-for-age z-score) were risk factors for Shigella. There was a linear dose-response between Shigella quantity and myeloperoxidase concentrations. The burden of Shigella varied widely across sites, but uniformly increased through the second year of life and was associated with intestinal inflammation.

			"article_name": "Differences in human milk peptide release along the gastrointestinal tract between preterm and term infants.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Preterm infants are born with a gastrointestinal tract insufficiently developed to digesting large quantities of human milk proteins. Peptides released from the digestion of human milk proteins have been identified with bioactivities that may be beneficial to the developing infant. However, it is unknown how prematurity affects total and bioactive peptide release along the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to compare milk peptide release from milk to stomach to stool between preterm and term infants. METHODS: Milk, gastric, and stool samples were collected from preterm infants as early collection (days 8 and 9 of life) and late collection (days 21 and 22 of life), and from term infants as early collection. Milk peptides were extracted from the samples and identified using Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Peptide abundance and count were compared across digestion and between the three infant groups at each stage of digestion. RESULTS: Total milk peptide count and abundance increased from milk to stomach then decreased in stool. Total peptide release was similar among the three infant groups for milk and stool samples. In the stomach, preterm early collection had significantly higher peptide abundance and count than the other two groups. Patterns for peptide release from individual milk proteins were distinct from total peptide release both across digestion and among the infant groups. When analyzing single peptides, term early collection gastric samples had significantly higher peptide abundance than preterm early collection for a known antimicrobial peptide, QELLLNPTHQIYPVTQPLAPVHNPISV. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm and term infants digest milk proteins differently along their gastrointestinal tracts. While preterm infants released more total peptides in the stomach, term infants released specific bioactive peptides at higher abundance. We identified a region at the C-terminus of beta-casein that is conserved from milk through stool and from which are released known and potential antimicrobial peptides.",

Some challenges exist in our ability to better understand sapovirus infections, including the inability to grow sapovirus in cell culture, which has hindered diagnosis and studies of immunity. Another challenge is that individuals with sapovirus infection are commonly coinfected with other enteric pathogens, complicating our ability to attribute the diarrhea episode to a single pathogen. RECENT FINDINGS: Development of molecular methods for sapovirus detection has increased our ability to measure disease prevalence. The prevalence of sapovirus varies between 1 and 17% of diarrhea episodes worldwide, with the highest burden in young children and older adults. Further, epidemiological studies have used novel approaches to account for the presence of coinfections with other enteric pathogens; one multisite cohort study of children under two years of age found that sapovirus had the second-highest attributable incidence among all diarrheal pathogens studied. SUMMARY: Especially in settings where rotavirus vaccines have been introduced, efforts to reduce the overall burden of childhood diarrhea should focus on the reduction of sapovirus transmission and disease burden.",

			"abstract": "Plant viruses have been reported to be common in the gut of human adults, presumably as result of food ingestion. In this work, we report that plant viruses can also be found frequently in the gut and oropharynx of children during their first year of life, even when they are exclusively breast-fed. Fecal and oropharynx samples were collected monthly, from birth to 1 year of age, from three apparently healthy children in a semi-rural community and analyzed by next generation sequencing. In 100% of the fecal samples and 65% of the oropharynx samples at least one plant virus was identified. Tobamoviruses in the Virgaviridae family were by far the most frequently detected, with tropical soda apple mosaic virus, pepper mild mottle virus, and opuntia tobamovirus 2 being the most common species. Seventeen complete virus genomes could be assembled, and phylogenetic analyses showed a large diversity of virus strains circulating in the population. These results suggest that children are continuously exposed to an extensive and highly diverse collection of tobamoviruses. Whether the common presence of plant viruses at an early age influences the infant's immune system, either directly or through interaction with other members of the microbiota, remains to be investigated.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Group A Rotavirus (RVA), despite being an important pathogen in hospitalized children, is less studied in pediatric outpatients, and even rarely investigated in adults. This study aims to understand the genetic diversity of RVA in outpatients across all age groups in Shanghai, and thus providing a molecular basis for vaccine implementation and evaluation. METHODS: Stool samples were first screened by Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR). RVA genotyping was performed through the amplification of partial VP7 and VP4 gene. Strains of interest were further sequenced and analyzed using MEGA 6.0. RESULTS: Four thousand nine hundred one samples were collected, from which 7.61% (373 cases) were screened positive for RVA. RVA prevalence was higher in children (9.30%) than in adults (7.21%) (chi(2) = 4.72, P < 0.05). 9.38% RVA positive cases had taken antibiotics before hospital visit while 49.60% had been prescribed antibiotics afterwards. RVA displayed a strong seasonality in both adults and children with a shared commonality in genotype repertoire, where G9P[8] was the most prevalent strain (67.96%) followed by G3P[8] (15.49%) and G1P[8] (12.32%). Meanwhile the first local case of fecal shedding of the G10P[15] vaccine strain was also discovered. CONCLUSIONS: While the prevalence of rotavirus is highest during cold seasons, it is revealed for the first time that G9P[8] is the predominant genotype in both adults and pediatric outpatients. Clinically, higher occurrence of nausea or vomiting was observed in RVA positive cases. Antibiotic overuse was implicated in both non-clinical and clinical settings. The finding emphasizes the importance of RVA genotyping in surveillance as it provides the basis for new vaccine application as well as a baseline for future vaccine efficacy evaluation.",

			"abstract": "Human astrovirus (HAstV) is recognized as one of the major causative agents of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Data on the genetic diversity of HAstV in Nigeria are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of classical HAstV in children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis in Ogun State, Nigeria. Fecal samples (331) as well as socio-demographic and clinical data were collected across the three senatorial districts of the state from February 2015 to April 2017. One hundred seventy-five samples were randomly selected and analyzed for the presence of HAstV using RT-PCR. PCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was done to determine genotypes and lineages. The overall prevalence rate was 19.4% (34), with the highest occurrence observed in 2015 (41.4%). Viral coinfections were detected in 13 cases (38.2%). HAstV infection occurred throughout the year and in all age groups, mainly in the age group of 0-12 months. There was significant association between prevalence rate and collection year; however, no association was observed with gender, age, symptoms or risk factors. HAstV-5 was the predominant genotype (76.5%) circulating throughout the study period, followed by HAstV-1 (23.5%), which circulated only in the first 2 years of the study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAstV-5 strains detected belonged to the 5a lineage, while HAstV-1 strains were grouped into lineage 1b. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive report on molecular characterization of classical HAstV among children with gastroenteritis in the country, and this will serve as baseline information for implementing appropriate infection control practices.",

			"abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common gastrointestinal disorder in premature neonates. This disease is characterized by massive epithelial necrosis, gut barrier dysfunction and improper mucosal defense development. Studies have shown that probiotic administration can decrease NEC incidence and mortality. The proposed mechanisms of probiotics for the prevention of NEC are: promotion of intestinal development; improved barrier function through decreased apoptosis and improved mucin production; decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, and TNFalpha, and modulation of microbiota dysbiosis in preterm infants. However, reported sepsis in the immunocompromised preterm host has deterred routine prophylactic administration of probiotics in the neonatal intensive care unit. We hypothesize that maternal administration of probiotics to pregnant mouse dams can recapitulate the beneficial effects observed in neonates fed with probiotics directly. We exposed pregnant mice to the probiotics and monitored the changes in the developing intestines of the offspring. Pregnant mice were fed daily with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis (LB) from embryonic day15 to 2-week-old postnatally. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-1beta in the pups was used to model proinflammatory insults. Sera were collected at 2 weeks of age and evaluated for inflammatory cytokines by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay and gut permeability by Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran tracer assay. Ileal tissues were collected for the evaluation of apoptosis and proliferation of the intestinal epithelium; as well as mucin and tight junction integrity at mucosal surface by immunofluorescent staining. We find that maternal LB exposure facilitated intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, prevented loss of mucin and preserved the intestinal integrity and barrier function and decreased serum levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the preweaned offsprings. in LB exposed pups. We demonstrate that maternal probiotic supplementation promotes gut maturation in developing offspring. This is potentially a safe alternative therapy to induce intestinal maturation and prevent prematurity-associated neonatal disorders.",

It is yet unclear whether early microbiota composition is significantly different in newborns conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) when compared with those who were conceived spontaneously. Additionally, little is known about the effect of gut microbiota composition on weight gain in early infancy. We aimed to characterize the features and the determinants of the gut microbiome in ART newborns and to assess the impact of early microbiota composition on their weight gain in early infancy in mother-infant dyads enrolled in the China National Birth Cohort (CNBC). Among 118 neonates born by ART and 91 neonates born following spontaneous conception, we observed significantly reduced gut microbiota alpha-diversity and declined Bacteroidetes relative abundance in ART neonates. The microbiota composition of ART neonates was largely driven by specific ART treatments, hinting the importance of fetus intrinsic host microenvironment on the early microbial colonization. Following up these neonates for six months after their births, we observed the effects of gut microbiome composition on infant rapid weight gaining. Collectively, we identified features and determinants of the gut microbiota composition in ART neonates, and provided evidence for the importance of microbiota composition in neonatal growth.",

Randomized controlled crossover (AB/BA) trial comparing PPV initiation with or without endotracheal suctioning in a manikin model of non-vigorous neonates born through MSAF. Participants were 20 neonatologists and 20 pediatric residents trained in advanced airway management. Timing of PPV initiation was longer with vs. without endotracheal suctioning in both pediatric residents (mean difference 13 s, 95% confidence interval 8 to 18 s; p < 0.0001) and neonatologists (mean difference 12 s, 95% confidence interval 8 to 16 s; p < 0.0001). The difference in timing of PPV initiation was similar between pediatric residents and neonatologists (mean difference - 1 s, 95% confidence interval - 7 to 6 s; p = 0.85).Conclusions: Performing immediate laryngoscopy with intubation and suctioning was associated with longer-but not clinically relevant-time of initiation of PPV compared with immediate PPV without intubation in a manikin model.

			"abstract": "The early-life gut microbiota is associated with potential development of diseases in adulthood. The sterile womb paradigm has been challenged by recent reports that revealed the presence of the meconium, amniotic fluid, and placenta microbiome. This study aimed to explore the maternal origin of the microbiota of neonate meconium by using the PacBio single-molecule real-time circular consensus sequencing technology. Such technology could produce high fidelity reads of full-length 16S rRNA genes, improving the sensitivity and specificity of taxonomic profiling. It also reduced the risk of false positives. This study analyzed the full-length 16S rRNA-based microbiota of maternal samples (amniotic fluid, feces, vaginal fluid, saliva) and first-pass meconium of 39 maternal-neonate pairs. Alpha- and beta-diversity analyses revealed sample type-specific microbiota features. Most sample types were dominated by sequences representing different genera (Lactobacillus and Curvibacter in the amniotic fluid and vaginal fluid microbiota; Bacillus and Escherichia/Shigella in the meconium microbiota; Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium in the maternal fecal microbiota; Streptococcus and Prevotella in the maternal saliva microbiota). Moreover, specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in all sample types. Dyad analysis revealed common OTUs between the meconium microbiota and microbiota of multiple maternal samples. The meconium microbiota shared more features with the amniotic fluid microbiota than the maternal fecal and vaginal microbiota. Our results strongly suggested that the meconium microbiota was seeded from multiple maternal body sites, and the amniotic fluid microbiota contributed most to the seeding of the meconium microbiota among the investigated maternal body sites.",

			"article_name": "Market integration and soil-transmitted helminth infection among the Shuar of Amazonian Ecuador.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections have many negative health outcomes (e.g., diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies) that can also exacerbate poverty. These infections are generally highest among low-income populations, many of which are also undergoing market integration (MI; increased participation in a market-based economy). Yet the direct impact of MI-related social and environmental changes on STH infection patterns is poorly understood, making it unclear which lifestyle factors should be targeted to better control disease spread. This cross-sectional study examines if household infrastructure associated with greater MI is associated with lower STH burdens among Indigenous Ecuadorian Shuar. METHODS: Kato-Katz fecal smears were used to determine STH infection status and intensity (n = 620 participants; 308 females, 312 males, aged 6 months-86 years); Ascaris lumbricoides (ascarid) and Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) were the primary infection types detected. Structured interviews assessing lifestyle patterns (e.g., measures of household infrastructure) measured participant MI. Multilevel regression analyses and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models tested associations between MI measures and STH infection status or intensity, controlling for individual and community characteristics. RESULTS: Participants residing in more market-integrated households exhibited lower infection rates and intensities than those in less market integrated households. Parasite infection status and T. trichiura infection intensity were lower among participants living in houses with wood floors than those with dirt floors, while individuals using well or piped water from a spring exhibited lower A. lumbricoides infection intensities compared to those using river or stream water. Unexpectedly, latrine type was not significantly related to STH infection status or intensity. These results suggest that sources of exposure differ between the two helminth species. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents associations between household measures and STH infection among an Indigenous population undergoing rapid MI. These findings can help healthcare programs better target interventions and reduce STH exposure among at-risk populations.",

Here, we characterize microbial community assembly in 47 infant-mother pairs from six Tsimane villages, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of longitudinal stool and tongue swab samples. We find that infant consumption of dairy products, vegetables, and chicha (a fermented drink inoculated with oral microbes) is associated with stool microbiota composition. In stool and tongue samples, microbes shared between mothers and infants are more abundant than non-shared microbes. Using a neutral model of community assembly, we find that neutral processes alone explain the prevalence of 79% of infant-colonizing microbes, but explain microbial prevalence less well in adults from river villages with more regular access to markets. Our results underscore the importance of neutral forces during microbiota assembly. Changing lifestyle factors may alter traditional modes of microbiota assembly by decreasing the role of neutral processes.",

In order to demonstrate the association between enteric viruses and NEC, stool specimens of 51 neonates with NEC and 39 \"normal\" neonates were collected to detect rotavirus (RV), astrovirus (ASV), sapovirus, enterovirus (EV), adenovirus (ADV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). Rotavirus A (RVA), ASV, EBV, and ADV were detected in both the NEC and control groups; however, EV and HBoV were detected only in the NEC group and CMV was not detected in either group. ASV was the most common enteric virus, but no significant differences were found between NEC and control groups, as was similarly the case for EBV and EV. The prevalence of ADV and HBoV was higher in the NEC group than in the control group (P = 0.011, P = 0.005, respectively) but RVA showed the opposite trend (P = 0.014). Virus positivity or negativity had no influence on the clinical manifestation of NEC.Conclusion: The roles of different viruses in NEC are not congruent. Some, such as ASV, may be regarded as commensal in neonates, while in NEC patients, the presence of ADV and EBV may be related to severity of disease. What is known: * The etiology of NEC remains unknown. Studies on necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) have not largely focused on enteric viruses and the conclusions were inconsistent. What is new: * Enteric viruses are common in the gut of neonates, but not all of them are pathogenic. * The existence of ADV and EBV may be related to the severity of NEC.",

It has been argued that calprotectin levels are higher in early age than in later life hampering the use of calprotectin in young children. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: To study age-related variation, we used data from our laboratory information system on consecutive, unselected fecal calprotectin measurements from 2014 to 2017 in all children aged 0 to 18 years. From each individual, the first measurement was included and repeated measurements were excluded. Fecal calprotectin was quantitated in the major clinical laboratory in southern Finland, HUSLAB with an ELISA kit from Calpro AS (Calpro/Calprolab, Oslo, Norway). Currently, the assay is performed on two automatic pipetting analysers (Dynex DS2, Chantilly, USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RESULTS: There were altogether 11,255 fecal calprotectin results from as many children. The median level of fecal calprotectin was 51 mg/kg in infants < 1 year of age (95(th) percentile 648 mg/kg; n = 239). This was 3-4-fold higher when compared to yearly age groups from 1 to 10 years (total number of children included 5,691). Across yearly age groups from 11 to 18, the median values varied from 11 to 19 mg/kg (total number of included children 5,325). The proportion of samples above the routine cut-off for an elevated concentration >100 mg/kg increased with increasing age.

A total of 137 fecal specimens from patients with severe HFMD were collected. Enterovirus (EV) types were determined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RT nested PCR, and sequencing. Sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics programs. Of 137 specimens tested, 97 (70.8%), 12 (8.8%), and 10 (7.3%) were positive for EV-A71, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), and CVA16, respectively. Other pathogens detected included CVA2 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA10 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA5 (0.7%, 1/137), echovirus 6 (E6) (0.7%, 1/137) and E18 (0.7%, 1/137). The most frequent complication in patients with proven EV infections was myoclonic jerk, followed by aseptic encephalitis, tachypnea, and vomiting. The frequencies of vomiting and abnormal eye movements were higher in EV-A71-infected patients than that in CVA6-infected or CVA16-infected patients. Molecular phylogeny based on the complete VP1 gene revealed no association between the subgenotype of the virus and disease severity. Nevertheless, 12 significant mutations that were likely to be associated with virulence or the clinical phenotype were observed in the 5'UTR, 2A(pro), 2C, 3A, 3D(pol) and 3'UTR of CVA6. Eight significant mutations were observed in the 5'UTR, 2B, 3A, 3D(pol) and 3'UTR of CVA16, and 10 significant mutations were observed in the 5'UTR, VP1, 3A and 3C(pro) of CVA10. In conclusion, EV-A71 is still the main pathogen causing severe HFMD, although other EV types can also cause severe complications.

We believed that the first colonizers of the newborn come from the mother's gut and vagina during pregnancy and that this is independent of the mode of delivery. We conducted an observational longitudinal study to evaluate the link between the maternal gut microbiota and the meconium's microbiota in extremely and very preterm neonates. Bacterial DNA was extracted from samples and specific bacterial groups were quantified by RT-PCR. In this cohort of 117 preterm neonates, we detected bacterial DNA in 88% of meconium samples. Meconium microbiota of neonates born after 28 gestational weeks (very preterm neonates) showed stronger correlations with their mothers' fecal microbiota. However, neonates born before 28 gestational weeks (extremely preterm neonates) had more Lactobacillus - genus that dominated the vaginal microbiota - than very preterm neonates, regardless of the mode of delivery. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that maternal bacteria from the gut and vagina can play a role in shaping neonates' gut microbiota and that mother-to-infant bacterial transmission is a controlled and time-specific process.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several reports have revealed that the first-pass meconium hosts a diverse microbiome, but its clinical significance is not known. OBJECTIVE: We designed a prospective population-based cohort study to evaluate whether the meconium microbiome predicts subsequent growth in children. METHODS: The study comprised 212 consecutive newborns with a meconium sample and a follow-up sample at 1 year of age. Trained nurses measured the children for weight and length using standardized techniques. We used next-generation sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and machine-learning approach for the analysis. RESULTS: The children with overweight at 3 years of age differed in their meconium microbiome from those with normal weight, having a higher proportion of Bacteroidetes phylum (29% vs 15%, P = .013). Using the machine-learning approach, the gut microbiome at birth predicted subsequent overweight with area under the curve 0.70 (SD 0.04). A lower proportion of Staphylococcus at birth was associated with greater length/height at 1 year (ss = -.68, P = .029) and 2 years of age (beta = -.74, P = .030). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiome of the first-pass meconium predicted subsequent overweight at the age of 3 years. The association between the gut microbiome and overweight appears to start already during pregnancy and at birth.",

			"abstract": "In acute gastroenteritis (GE), identification of the infectious agent is important for patient management and surveillance. The prevalence of GE caused by protozoa may be underestimated in Swedish patients. The purpose was to compare the prevalence of E. histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., G. intestinalis, and C. cayetanensis in samples from patients where the clinician had requested testing for gastrointestinal parasites only (n = 758) to where testing for bacterial GE only (n = 803) or where both parasite and bacterial testing (n = 1259) was requested and a healthy control group (n = 197). This prospective cohort study was conducted in Region Jonkoping County, Sweden (October 2018-March 2019). Fecal samples were analyzed with microscopy and real-time PCR. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 16 patients in the bacterial GE group and in 13 in the both bacterial and parasite group; no cases were detected in the group were only parasite infection was suspected. C. cayetanensis was detected in two patients in the bacterial GE group. One case of E. histolytica was detected in the bacterial group and one in the both bacterial and parasite group. G. intestinalis was detected in 14 patients in the parasite only group, 12 in the both parasite and bacterial group, three in the bacterial GE group, and one in the control group. Diarrhea caused by protozoa, especially Cryptosporidium was under-recognized by clinicians and is likely more common than hitherto estimated in Sweden. A more symptom-based diagnostic algorithm may increase detection and knowledge about protozoan infections.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Researchers are debating if fecal calprotectin results are useful for infant patients, especially in screening for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Currently, none of the FDA-approved calprotectin assays provide a cut-off for infant patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from a reference laboratory and university hospital to investigate if a cut-off could be established for infant patients. METHODS: Data from a national reference laboratory of 5144 test results for fecal calprotectin were analyzed for infant patients, and a cut-off was estimated based on the distribution of results. Additionally, a literature proposed cut-off of 226 mug/g was also considered. Validation of either cut-off was attempted by review of the electronic medical record of our university hospital for 110 infant patients with results for fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: Infants had a high percentage of elevated fecal calprotectin results when using the adult cut-offs set by the manufacturer. A cut-off of 247 mug/g was estimated based on the reference laboratory results for infants 0-2 months old, which is similar to a literature proposed cut-off of 226 mug/g. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) for both cut-offs was <0.6 when retrospectively analyzing data from a university hospital. CONCLUSION: Due to the low PPVs, the two infant-specific cut-offs for fecal calprotectin would not be useful to screen for NEC in infants at our university hospital.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are more likely to have mild or no symptoms compared with adults and may represent important vectors for transmitting the virus. Little is known about the duration of respiratory and gastrointestinal viral shedding in children with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine the average shedding times of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts in children. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL databases for studies reporting real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) results in children with COVID-19, then extracted and synthesized data on duration of viral shedding from symptom onset in respiratory and gastrointestinal samples. RESULTS: Based on data compiled from 69 pediatric cases, the duration of viral shedding through the respiratory tract is up to 24 days from symptom onset with a mean of 11.1 +/- 5.8 days. Of the children who underwent testing with stool PCR, rectal swab or anal swab, 86% returned a positive result. The mean duration of viral shedding via the gastrointestinal tract was 23.6 +/- 8.8 days from symptom onset. In 89% of cases, viral shedding via the gastrointestinal tract persisted after nasopharyngeal or throat swabs became negative, for as long as 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically review the duration of respiratory and gastrointestinal viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients. These findings may have important implications for infection control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated nutritive effects of prebiotics on infant behavior state, physiology, or metabolic status. METHODS: In this double-blind randomized study, infants (n = 161) received cow's milk-based infant formula (Control) or similar formula with an added prebiotic blend (polydextrose and galactooligosaccharides [PDX/GOS]) from 14-35 to 112 days of age. Infant wake behavior (crying/fussing, awake/content) and 24-h sleep-wake actograms were analyzed (Baseline, Days 70 and 112). Salivary cortisol was immunoassayed (Days 70 and 112). In a subset, exploratory stool 16S ribosomal RNA-sequencing was analyzed (Baseline, Day 112). RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one infants completed the study. Average duration of crying/fussing episodes was similar at Baseline, significantly shorter for PDX/GOS vs. Control at Day 70, and the trajectory continued at Day 112. Latency to first and second nap was significantly longer for PDX/GOS vs. Control at Day 112. Cortisol awakening response was demonstrated at Days 70 and 112. Significant stool microbiome beta-diversity and individual taxa abundance differences were observed in the PDX/GOS group. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate faster consolidation of daytime waking state in infants receiving prebiotics and support home-based actigraphy to assess early sleep-wake patterns. A prebiotic effect on wake organization is consistent with influence on the gut-brain axis and warrants further investigation. IMPACT: Few studies have evaluated nutritive effects of prebiotics on infant behavior state, cortisol awakening response, sleep-wake entrainment, and gut microbiome. Faster consolidation of daytime waking state was demonstrated in infants receiving a prebiotic blend in infant formula through ~4 months of age. Shorter episodes of crying were demonstrated at ~2 months of age (time point corresponding to age/developmental range associated with peak crying) in infants receiving formula with added prebiotics. Results support home-based actigraphy as a suitable method to assess early sleep-wake patterns. Prebiotic effect on wake organization is consistent with influence on the gut-brain axis and warrants further investigation.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The survival of antibody isotypes specific to pertussis toxin (PT) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) from mother's own milk (MBM) and donor breast milk (DBM) during preterm infant digestion was investigated. METHODS: Feed, gastric, and stool samples were collected from 20 preterm mother-infant pairs at 8-9 days and 21-22 days postpartum. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-FHA or anti-PT immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, and IgG. RESULTS: Anti-PT IgA, anti-FHA IgG, and anti-PT IgG were lower in MBM than DBM at 8-9 days postpartum, whereas anti-FHA IgM was higher in MBM than DBM. Anti-PT IgA, anti-PT IgG, and anti-FHA IgG in DBM decreased in gastric contents at both postpartum times but those antibodies in MBM were stable or increased during gastric digestion. Anti-FHA-specific IgA and IgM were higher in gastric contents from infants fed MBM than from infants fed DBM at 8-9 days. All pertussis antibodies were detected in infant stools at both postpartum times. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis-specific antibodies from MBM were stable during infant digestion, whereas anti-pertussis IgA and IgG from DBM decreased in gastric contents. The constant region and variable region of antibodies and maternal immunization appear to be the critical factors for their stability to proteolytic digestion and pasteurization. IMPACT: Pertussis-specific antibodies from mother's breast milk were stable during infant digestion, whereas anti-pertussis IgA and IgG from donor breast milk decreased in gastric contents. The constant region and variable region of pertussis-specific antibodies and the maternal immunization (previous infections and vaccinations) appear to be the critical factors for their stability to proteolytic digestion and pasteurization. Pertussis-specific antibodies from either mother's breast milk or donor breast milk survived during preterm infant digestion and both types of milk will compensate for the lower IgG transplacental transfer in preterm infants compared with term infants.",

Recently, gastroenteric viruses, including rotavirus (RVA), human astrovirus (HAstV), and norovirus (NoV), have also been associated with CNS neurological disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of EV, RVA, HAst, and NoV associated to CNS infections with undiagnosed etiology in Northwest region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and to conduct the molecular characterization of the positive samples detected. A total of 288 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from July to December 2017 were tested for EV and NoV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), HAstV by conventional RT-PCR, and RVA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Positive-EV samples were inoculated in cells lines, amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. RVA, NoV, and HAstV were not detected. EV infection was detected in 5.5% (16/288), and five samples successful genotyped: echovirus 3 (E3) (1/5), coxsackie virus A6 (CVA6) (1/5), and coxsackie virus B4 (CVB4) (3/5). Meningitis was the main syndrome observed (12/16; 75%). CVA6, CVB4, and E3 were identified associated with aseptic meningitis. Reports of CVA6 associated with aseptic meningitis are rare, E3 had not been previously reported in Brazil, and epidemiological data on CVB4 in the country is virtually unknown. The present investigation illustrates the circulation of diverse EV types in a small regional sample set and in a short period of time, highlighting the importance of an active EV surveillance system in CNS infections. Enhanced understanding of undiagnosed CNS infections will assist in public health and health care planning.",

			"abstract": "PURPOSE:  To describe the postnatal outcome of fetal meconium peritonitis and identify prenatal predictors of neonatal surgery. METHODS:  We retrospectively reviewed all fetuses with ultrasound findings suspicious for meconium peritonitis at a single center over a 10-year period. A systematic review and meta-analysis were then performed pooling our results with previous studies assessing prenatally diagnosed meconium peritonitis and postnatal outcome. Prenatal sonographic findings were analyzed to identify predictors for postnatal surgery. RESULTS:  34 cases suggestive of meconium peritonitis were diagnosed at our center. These were pooled with cases from 14 other studies yielding a total of 244 cases. Postnatal abdominal surgery was required in two thirds of case (66.5 %). The strongest predictor of neonatal surgery was meconium pseudocyst (OR [95 % CI] 6.75 [2.53-18.01]), followed by bowel dilation (OR [95 % CI] 4.17 [1.93-9.05]) and ascites (OR [95 % CI] 2.57 [1.07-5.24]). The most common cause of intestinal perforation and meconium peritonitis, found in 52.2 % of the cases, was small bowel atresia. Cystic fibrosis was diagnosed in 9.8 % of cases. Short-term neonatal outcomes were favorable, with a post-operative mortality rate of 8.1 % and a survival rate of 100 % in neonates not requiring surgery. CONCLUSION:  Meconium pseudocysts, bowel dilation, and ascites are prenatal predictors of neonatal surgery in cases of meconium peritonitis. Fetuses with these findings should be delivered in centers with pediatric surgery services. Though the prognosis is favorable, cystic fibrosis complicates postnatal outcomes.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: As a developing country, Brazil presents a wide range of environmental risks that can constitute hazards to child health. The country also presents different socio-economic-cultural conditions that could be responsible for determining different vulnerability and susceptibility levels for the population, which can potentiate the effects of the environmental pollutants. The Rio Birth Cohort Study (PIPA project) is a prospective maternal-infant health study, hosted in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Southeastern Brazil), designed to investigate separate and combined effects of environmental chemical pollutants, as well as the interactions between these exposures and sociocultural environment and epigenetic patterns. This paper presents the learned lessons and strategies to address the shortcomings detected from this pilot study. METHODS: The study population will be all children born at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Maternity Hospital from July 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2021. The estimated population is of 2,500 children. The study will collect social, demographic, and health information from pregnant women and their children up to four years of age. Biological samples from both mothers and newborns will be collected to assess metal, pesticide and plasticizer exposure. All newborns will have their landmarks of physical, neurological, psychological, and cognitive development recorded at specific ages. FINDINGS: A pilot study was carried out between September 2017 and August 2018, totaling 142 enrolled pregnant women, leading to 135 (95%) births and the collection of umbilical cord (126-93%,) and mother (139-98%) blood samples, as well as both mother (142-100%) and newborn (54-40%) urine samples and newborn meconium samples (117-86.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The study proposes a comprehensive assessment of pre- and postnatal exposure to environmental chemicals at multiple time points in a population living in a highly urbanized developing country. As far as we know, this is the only birth cohort in Brazil specifically designed for this purpose.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Kenya, typhoid fever and invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis present a huge burden of disease, especially in poor-resource settings where clean water supply and sanitation conditions are inadequate. The epidemiology of both diseases is poorly understood in terms of severity and risk factors. The aim of the study was to determine the disease burden and spatial distribution of salmonellosis, as well as socioeconomic and environmental risk factors for these infections, in a large informal settlement near the city of Nairobi, from 2013 to 2017. METHODS: Initially, a house-to-house baseline census of 150,000 population in Mukuru informal settlement was carried out and relevant socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare utilization information was collected using structured questionnaires. Salmonella bacteria were cultured from the blood and faeces of children < 16 years of age who reported at three outpatient facilities with fever alone or fever and diarrhea. Tests of association between specific Salmonella serotypes and risk factors were conducted using Pearson Chi-Square (chi(2)) test. RESULTS: A total of 16,236 children were recruited into the study. The prevalence of bloodstream infections by Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), consisting of Salmonella Typhimurium/ Enteriditis, was 1.3%; Salmonella Typhi was 1.4%, and this was highest among children < 16 years of age. Occurrence of Salmonella Typhimurium/ Enteriditis was not significantly associated with rearing any domestic animals. Rearing chicken was significantly associated with high prevalence of S. Typhi (2.1%; p = 0.011). The proportion of children infected with Salmonella Typhimurium/ Enteriditis was significantly higher in households that used water pots as water storage containers compared to using water directly from the tap (0.6%). Use of pit latrines and open defecation were significant risk factors for S. Typhi infection (1.6%; p = 0.048). The proportion of Salmonella Typhimurium/ Enteriditis among children eating street food 4 or more times per week was higher compared to 1 to 2 times/week on average (1.1%; p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Typhoidal and NTS are important causes of illness in children in Mukuru informal settlement, especially among children less than 16 years of age. Improving Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) including boiling water, breastfeeding, hand washing practices, and avoiding animal contact in domestic settings could contribute to reducing the risk of transmission of Salmonella disease from contaminated environments.",

AIM: To determine whether increased fecal calprotectin during pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in IBD. METHODS: This is a multicenter cohort study of women with IBD who underwent fecal calprotectin monitoring during pregnancy. Fecal calprotectin levels were stratified by trimester, and adverse pregnancy-related outcomes were recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test assessed differences between continuous variables, whereas categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test. RESULTS: Eighty-five women with IBD were included. First trimester fecal calprotectin was higher in patients who underwent emergency Cesarean birth compared to those who had a vaginal delivery (503 ug/g, IQR 1554.3 ug/g vs. 130 ug/g, IQR 482 ug/g, p = .030, respectively) and in those who delivered infants with low birth weight compared to normal birth weight (1511 ug/g, IQR 579 ug/g vs. 168 ug/g, IQR 413 ug/g, p = .049, respectively). Third trimester fecal calprotectin was higher in those with non-elective induction of labor (334.5 ug/g, IQR 1411.0 ug/g) compared to those with spontaneous delivery (116.5 ug/g, IQR 227.1 ug/g) (p = .025). Those with a fecal calprotectin >/= 250 ug/g in the second trimester had an increased incidence of infants with low birth weight (35.3% vs. 3.8%) (p = .049), whereas those with a fecal calprotectin >/= 250 ug/g in the third trimester had an increased incidence of non-elective induction of labor (43.8% vs. 10.3%, p = .030).

The implementation of PCR targeting specific virulence genes characteristic of the five DEC pathotypes, has improved the detection of DEC in faecal specimens from patients with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease.Aim. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of 660 strains of DEC isolated between 2015 and 2017 from UK travellers reporting symptoms of gastrointestinal disease were reviewed to look for evidence of emerging AMR associated with travellers' diarrhoea.Methodology. All isolates of DEC were sequenced, and sequence type, serotype, pathotype markers and AMR profiles were derived from the genome data.Results. A travel history was provided for 54.1 % (357/660) of cases, of which 77.0 % (275/357) reported travel outside the UK within 7 days of onset of symptoms, and 23.0 % (82/357) reported no travel in that time frame. Of the 660 strains of DEC in this study, 265 (40.2 %) samples were identified as EAEC, 48 (7.3 %) as EIEC, 61 (9.2 %) were ETEC and 286 (43.3 %) were EPEC. EPEC caused the highest percentage of infections in children (40.6 %) whilst the highest proportion of cases reporting recent travel were infected with ETEC (86.1 %). There were 390/660 (59.0 %) isolates resistant to at least one antimicrobial on the panel tested (EIEC, 81.3 %; ETEC, n=65.6 %; EAEC, n=73.2 %; EPEC, 40.9 %) and 265/660 (40.2 %) were multidrug-resistant (EIEC, 33.3 %; ETEC, 32.8 %; EAEC, 56.2 %; EPEC, 28.0 %). Genes conferring resistance to the beta-lactams and fluroquinolones were highest in the EAEC pathotype, 56.6 and 60.7%, respectively.Conclusions. Increasing MDR, along with resistance to the fluroquinolones and the third-generation cephalosporins, in DEC causing travellers' diarrhoea provides further evidence for the need to restrict the use of antimicrobial agents and continuous monitoring.",

			"article_name": "Cytotoxin-producing Klebsiella oxytoca in the preterm gut and its association with necrotizing enterocolitis.",
			"abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal inflammatory disease of premature infants associated with gut bacterial dysbiosis. Using 16S rRNA-based methods, our laboratory identified an unclassified Enterobacteriaceae sequence (NEC_unk_OTU) with high abundance in NEC fecal samples. We aimed to identify this bacterium and determine its potential role in the disease. NCBI database searches for the 16S sequence, selective culture systems, biotyping and polymerase chain reaction were employed to refine classification of NEC_unk_OTU and identify toxin-encoding genes from the index NEC case. Bacterial cytotoxin production was confirmed by mass spectrometry and apoptosis assays. Additional fecal samples from 9 NEC and 5 non-NEC controls were analyzed using similar methods and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to investigate clonal relationships and define sequence types of the isolates. NEC_unk_OTU was identified as Klebsiella oxytoca, a pathobiont known to cause antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis, but not previously linked to NEC. Including the index case, cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca were isolated from 6 of 10 subjects with NEC; in these, the K. oxytoca 16S sequence predominated the fecal microbiota. Cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca also were isolated from 4 of 5 controls; in these, however, the abundance of the corresponding 16S sequence was very low. MLST analysis of the toxin-positive isolates demonstrated no clonal relationships and similar genetic clustering between cases and controls. These results suggest cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca colonize a substantial proportion of premature infants. Some, perhaps many, cases of NEC may be precipitated by outgrowth of this opportunistic pathogen.",

			"abstract": "Though bulk stool remains the gold standard specimen type for enteropathogen diagnosis, rectal swabs may offer comparable sensitivity with greater ease of collection for select pathogens. This study sought to evaluate the validity and reproducibility of rectal swabs as a sample collection method for the molecular diagnosis of Giardia duodenalis. Paired rectal swab and bulk stool samples were collected from 86 children ages 0-4 years living in southwest Niger, with duplicate samples collected among a subset of 50 children. Infection was detected using a previously validated real-time PCR diagnostic targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Giardia duodenalis was detected in 65.5% (55/84) of bulk stool samples and 44.0% (37/84) of swab samples. The kappa evaluating test agreement was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.54-1.00) among duplicate stool samples (N = 49) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.47-1.00) among duplicate rectal swabs (N = 48). Diagnostic sensitivity was 93% (95% CI: 84-98) by bulk stool and 63% (95% CI: 49-75) by rectal swabs. When restricting to the lowest three quartiles of bulk stool quantitation cycle values (an indication of relatively high parasite load), sensitivity by rectal swabs increased to 78.0% (95% CI: 64-89, P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that rectal swabs provide less sensitive and reproducible results than bulk stool for the real-time PCR diagnosis of G. duodenalis. However, their fair sensitivity for higher parasite loads suggests that swabs may be a useful tool for detecting higher burden infections when stool collection is excessively expensive or logistically challenging.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 together with the maternal diet avoidance of cow's milk in treating infantile colic. METHODS: Forty-five colicky breastfed infants were consecutively randomized to receive L. rhamnosus for 28 days at a dosage of 5 x 10(9) cfu per day or placebo. Faecal samples were collected from each subject before starting supplementation and at the end of the study period and were immediately analysed. Faecal calprotectin was detected via a quantitative assay. The total bacterial load and selected bacterial species were evaluated using real-time TaqMan PCR. RESULTS: After supplementation for 28 days with Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, median full-force daily crying was reduced (104 versus 242 min, p < 0.001) and the values of faecal calprotectin decreased significantly (p = 0.026). Furthermore, the probiotic increased the abundance of Lactobacillus (p = 0.048) and total bacteria (p = 0.040); all these effects were not observed in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Infants treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 for 28 days, in association with the elimination of cow's milk from the maternal diet, presented some interesting features related to the effect of this probiotic treatment: reductions in crying time and faecal calprotectin, with increased total bacteria and Lactobacillus. To validate these results, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on a larger cohort is required.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Giardia duodenalis is one of the most common parasites in the UK to cause diarrhoeal illness. Giardiasis is likely to be significantly under-reported in the UK as laboratory testing is largely based on examining stool samples from individuals with a recent travel history. This results in the majority of locally-acquired cases going undetected. To increase awareness of giardiasis, we describe data gathered from cases reported within Scotland during 2011-2018. METHODS: All of the 21 Scottish National Health Service (NHS) diagnostic microbiology laboratories performed microscopy examination to detect Giardia cysts in stools, from mostly travel-related cases. The exception was one laboratory that implemented an antigen-based enzyme immunoassay in 2015. This resulted in every submitted stool being tested for Giardia. Laboratory-confirmed cases of giardiasis were reported to Health Protection Scotland (HPS) via the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS) during the eight-year period. Data for calculating the incidence per 100,000 of the population were obtained from the National Records of Scotland mid-2018 population estimates in Scotland. RESULTS: A total of 1631 Scottish cases were reported during 2011-2018 (8-year mean: 204; range: 166-269). National Health Service Grampian, Borders and Lothian reported the highest incidence of Giardia (9.8, 7.5 and 6.7 per 100,000, respectively), all of which were above the Scottish mean incidence (3.8 per 100,000). Following the implementation of antigen testing in NHS Grampian during 2015, reports significantly increased 3.6-fold (P = 0.005). The highest incidence of giardiasis occurred in the 20-49 years age group (mean 5.4 per 100,000). Of interest, the mean incidence of giardiasis was significantly higher in males than in females (4.8 versus 3.1 per 100,000, respectively; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the need to capture enhanced information on every laboratory-confirmed case of giardiasis to gain a better understanding of the local sources and transmission pathways occurring in Scotland. In addition, implementing sensitive, automated technologies across UK NHS diagnostic microbiology laboratories to permit the efficient, routine testing of every submitted stool for Giardia, should be encouraged to ensure all cases are identified and treated appropriately.",

			"abstract": "Background: Non-digestible carbohydrates are added to infant formula to mimic the effects of human milk oligosaccharide by acting as prebiotics and stimulating the immune system. Although not yet used in infant formulas, beta-glucans are known to have beneficial health effects, and are therefore of potential interest for supplementation. Methods and results: We investigated the in vitro fermentation of native and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase-treated oat beta-glucan using pooled fecal inocula of 2- and 8-week-old infants. While native oat beta-glucan was not utilized, both inocula specifically utilized oat beta-glucan oligomers containing beta(1-->4)-linkages formed upon enzyme treatment. The fermentation rate was highest in the fecal microbiota of 2-week-old infants, and correlated with a high lactate production. Fermentation of media supplemented with native and enzyme-treated oat beta-glucans increased the relative abundance of Enterococcus and attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha) in immature dendritic cells. This attenuating effect was more pronounced after enzyme treatment. This attenuation might result from the enhanced ability of fermented oat beta-glucan to stimulate Dectin-1 receptors. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase treatment enhances the fermentability of oat beta-glucan and attenuates pro-inflammatory responses. Hence, this study shows that especially enzyme-treated oat beta-glucans have a high potential for supplementation of infant formula.",

There are still no vaccines or specific antiviral therapies against RSV, mainly due to the inadequate understanding of RSV pathogenesis. Recent data suggest a role for gut microbiota community structure in determining RSV disease severity. Our objective was to determine the gut microbial profile associated with severe RSV patients, which could be used to help identify at-risk patients and develop therapeutically protective microbial assemblages that may stimulate immuno-protection. RESULTS: We enrolled 95 infants from Le Bonheur during the 2014 to 2016 RSV season. Of these, 37 were well-babies and 58 were hospitalized with RSV. Of the RSV infected babies, 53 remained in the pediatric ward (moderate) and 5 were moved to the pediatric intensive care unit at a later date (severe). Stool samples were collected within 72 h of admission; and the composition of gut microbiota was evaluated via 16S sequencing of fecal DNA. There was a significant enrichment in S24_7, Clostridiales, Odoribacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Actinomyces in RSV (moderate and severe) vs. controls. Patients with severe RSV disease had slightly lower alpha diversity (richness and evenness of the bacterial community) of the gut microbiota compared to patients with moderate RSV and healthy controls. Beta diversity (overall microbial composition) was significantly different between all RSV patients (moderate and severe) compared to controls and had significant microbial composition separating all three groups (control, moderate RSV, and severe RSV). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data demonstrate that a unique gut microbial profile is associated with RSV disease and with severe RSV disease with admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. More mechanistic experiments are needed to determine whether the differences observed in gut microbiota are the cause or consequences of severe RSV disease.",

We show that the fermented formula, safe and well tolerated, induces an increase in secretory IgA (but not in antimicrobial peptides) and reduces the diversity of the microbiota, similarly, but not as much as, breastmilk. Metabolome analysis allowed us to distinguish subjects based on their dietary regimen and mode of delivery. Together, these results suggest that a fermented formula favors the maturation of the immune system, microbiota and metabolome.",

METHODS: We included very preterm inborn infants of </= 32 weeks of gestational age being fecal carriers of ESBL-E and compared them with 1:1 matched (gestational age, birth weight, gender and year) controls tested negative for ESBL-E in the stool between 2005 and 2016. An association with NEC was defined as the first detection of ESBL-E before or at the time of definite diagnosis of NEC. RESULTS: During the study period, we diagnosed 217 infants with a total of 270 ESBL-E. We identified ten different species with ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca being the most common one (46%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (19%), and Citrobacter freundii (17%). Ten out of 217 infants had any kind of NEC in the case group compared to two of the controls (p < 0.01), but only four cases with predefined criteria were associated with NEC >/= stage IIa (1.8 vs. 0.5%, p = 0.089, OR 4.1, CI95% 0.45-36.6).

			"abstract": "The gut of healthy human neonates is usually devoid of viruses at birth, but quickly becomes colonized, which-in some cases-leads to gastrointestinal disorders(1-4). Here we show that the assembly of the viral community in neonates takes place in distinct steps. Fluorescent staining of virus-like particles purified from infant meconium or early stool samples shows few or no particles, but by one month of life particle numbers increase to 10(9) per gram, and these numbers seem to persist throughout life(5-7). We investigated the origin of these viral populations using shotgun metagenomic sequencing of virus-enriched preparations and whole microbial communities, followed by targeted microbiological analyses. Results indicate that, early after birth, pioneer bacteria colonize the infant gut and by one month prophages induced from these bacteria provide the predominant population of virus-like particles. By four months of life, identifiable viruses that replicate in human cells become more prominent. Multiple human viruses were more abundant in stool samples from babies who were exclusively fed on formula milk compared with those fed partially or fully on breast milk, paralleling reports that breast milk can be protective against viral infections(8-10). Bacteriophage populations also differed depending on whether or not the infant was breastfed. We show that the colonization of the infant gut is stepwise, first mainly by temperate bacteriophages induced from pioneer bacteria, and later by viruses that replicate in human cells; this second phase is modulated by breastfeeding.",

Serum biomarkers to aid diagnosis, such as intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and calprotectin, are actively being investigated; however, the normative values of these markers among healthy premature and term infants remains unknown. We sought to identify normative values for the serum concentrations of IFABP and calprotectin across gestational (GA) and post-menstrual age. METHODS: We collected serum from infants (24-40 weeks GA) in the first week of life and at multiple time points in a sub-cohort of premature infants (24-29 weeks GA), excluding sepsis or known intestinal disease. IFABP and calprotectin were measured using ELISA. Groups were compared with descriptive statistics and mixed effects linear regression. RESULTS: One hundred twelve infants had specimens in the first week of life, and 19 premature infants had longitudinal specimens. IFABP concentration in the first week of life was low and did not differ across gestational ages. Longitudinally, IFABP increased 4% per day (P < 0.001). Calprotectin concentration in the first week of life was more variable. An inverse relationship between day of life and calprotectin level was found in the longitudinal cohort (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Serum IFABP and calprotectin fluctuate over time. Infants had low levels of IFABP during the first week of life, independent of gestational age, and levels increased longitudinally in premature infants. Calprotectin levels generally declined over time. Normative data for infants is necessary to establish meaningful cut-off levels for clinical use.",

To determine the immune status of children and the effect of diet at different ages, we examined the level of cytokines, bile acids in the fecal water and weaning food frequency. The fecal microbiota of the children before weaning contained mainly Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, which presented at low abundance in the samples of mothers. After weaning, the fecal microbiome of children was mainly of the Prevotella type, with decreasing levels of Bifidobacterium, thus becoming more like the fecal microbiome of the mother. The abundance of infant fecal commensals generally correlated inversely with potential pathogens before weaning. The fecal Bifidobacterium in children correlated inversely with the consumption of complex carbohydrates and fruits after weaning. The specific cytokines related to the proliferation and maturation of immunity were found to increase after weaning. A decreasing level of primary bile acids and an increase of secondary bile acids were observed after weaning.

However, inter-individual variation has not been comprehensively assessed in a multi-ethnic study. We studied a longitudinal birth cohort of 106 infants of three Asian ethnicities (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) that resided in the same geographical location (Singapore). Specific and temporal influences of ethnicity, mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, gestational age, birthweight, gender, and maternal education on the development of the gut microbiota in the first 2 years of life were studied. Mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, and ethnicity were identified as the main factors influencing the compositional development of the gut microbiota. Effects of delivery mode and breastfeeding status lasted until 6M and 3M, respectively, with the primary impact on the diversity and temporal colonization of the genera Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. The effect of ethnicity was apparent at 3M post-birth, even before the introduction of weaning (complementary) foods, and remained significant after adjusting for delivery mode and breastfeeding status. Ethnic influences remained significant until 12M in the Indian and Chinese infants. The microbiota of Indian infants was characterized by higher abundances of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, while Chinese infants had higher abundances of Bacteroides and Akkermansia.

We report a series of 35 patients diagnosed prenatally with MP by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), illustrate the imaging findings and investigate the predictive value of these findings for postpartum management. METHOD: A consecutive cohort of patients diagnosed with MP who were born at our institution from 2013 to 2018 was enrolled retrospectively. The prenatal ultrasound and MRI findings were analyzed. Fisher's exact probability test was used to evaluate the predictive value of MRI for surgical intervention between the operative group and the nonoperative group. RESULTS: Ascites (30/35) and distended bowel loops (27/35) were two of the most common prenatal MP-related findings on fetal MRI. Of the 35 infants, 26 received surgical intervention. All fetuses with MRI scans showing bowel dilatation (14/26, p = 0.048) and micro-colorectum (13/26, p = 0.013) required surgery.

In this study, we tried to explore the effects of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota of C-section neonates. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six Chinese neonates were enrolled in this study. The neonates were divided into four groups: VD (natural delivery neonates, n = 3), CD (cesarean-born neonates, n = 9), CDL (cesarean-born neonates supplemented with probiotic at a lower dosage, n = 7), and CDH (cesarean-born neonates supplemented with probiotic at a higher dosage, n = 7). Fecal samples were collected on the 3rd, 7th, and 28th day since birth. The V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene was sequenced by next-generation sequencing technology. RESULTS: The alpha-diversity of the intestinal microbiota of cesarean delivery neonates was significantly lower than that of the naturally delivered neonates on the 28th day (p = 0.005). After supplementation with probiotics for 28 days, the alpha-diversity and the beta-diversity of the gut flora in the cesarean-born infants (CDL28 and CDH28) was similar to that in the vaginally delivery infants. Meanwhile, the abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly increased since the 3rd day of probiotic supplementation. Besides, the sustained supplementation of probiotics to neonates would help improve the abundance of the operational taxonomic units in several different Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins.

STUDY DESIGN: Preterm infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit with a gestational age of 26 to 32 weeks were prospectively surveyed and eligible for stool collection on days 7 and 28 of postnatal age between February 2016 and June 2017. A 16S rRNA sequencing approach was applied to compare the gut microbiota composition between the BPD group and controls. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the predictor variables. RESULTS: Eight subjects in the BPD group and 10 subjects in the preterm group were analyzed during the observation period. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were the four dominant bacteria phyla of intestinal microflora. A significantly lower diversity of gut microbiota was observed in the BPD group compared with the preterm group on day 28 (number of observed operational taxonomic units, p = 0.034; abundance-based coverage estimator, p = 0.022; Shannon index, p = 0.028). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that high Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System score (>==19) at 24 hours was statistically significant in predicting the proportion of aerobic with facultative anaerobic bacteria on day 28 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Infants with BPD are prone to develop gut dysbiosis in early life. A higher severity of illness and treatment intensity may indicate a higher risk of disrupting an anaerobic environment in the gut during the first month of life. KEY POINTS: . BPD patients are prone to develop gut dysbiosis.. . Lower diversity of gut microbiota.. . Higher risk of disrupting anaerobic environment..",

			"abstract": "Klebsiella spp. are frequently enriched in the gut microbiota of preterm neonates, and overgrowth is associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), nosocomial infections and late-onset sepsis. Little is known about the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of preterm-associated Klebsiella, as previous studies have focused on the recovery of antimicrobial-resistant isolates or culture-independent molecular analyses. The aim of this study was to better characterize preterm-associated Klebsiella populations using phenotypic and genotypic approaches. Faecal samples from a UK cohort of healthy and sick preterm neonates (n=109) were screened on MacConkey agar to isolate lactose-positive Enterobacteriaceae. Whole-genome sequences were generated for Klebsiella spp., and virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes identified. Antibiotic susceptibility profiling and in vitro macrophage and iron assays were undertaken for the Klebsiella strains. Metapangenome analyses with a manually curated genome dataset were undertaken to examine the diversity of Klebsiella oxytoca and related bacteria in a publicly available shotgun metagenome dataset. Approximately one-tenth of faecal samples harboured Klebsiella spp. (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7.3 %; Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, 0.9 %; Klebsiella grimontii, 2.8 %; Klebsiella michiganensis, 1.8 %). Isolates recovered from NEC- and sepsis-affected infants and those showing no signs of clinical infection (i.e. 'healthy') encoded multiple beta-lactamases. No difference was observed between isolates recovered from healthy and sick infants with respect to in vitro siderophore production (all encoded enterobactin in their genomes). All K. pneumoniae, K. quasipneumoniae, K. grimontii and K. michiganensis faecal isolates tested were able to reside and persist in macrophages, indicating their immune evasion abilities. Metapangenome analyses of published metagenomic data confirmed our findings regarding the presence of K. michiganensis in the preterm gut. There is little difference in the phenotypic and genomic characteristics of Klebsiella isolates recovered from healthy and sick infants. Identification of beta-lactamases in all isolates may prove problematic when defining treatment regimens for NEC or sepsis, and suggests that healthy preterm infants contribute to the resistome. Refined analyses with curated sequence databases are required when studying closely related species present in metagenomic data.",

			"abstract": "SCOPE: Inulin-type fructans are commonly applied in infant formula to support development of gut microbiota and immunity. These inulin-type fructans are considered to be fermented by gut microbiota, but it is unknown how fermentation impacts immune modulating capacity and whether the process of fermentation is dependent on the infant's age. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro fermentation of chicory fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and native inulin are investigated using pooled fecal inocula of two- and eight-week-old infants. Both inocula primarily utilize the trisaccharides in FOS, while they almost completely utilize native inulin with degree of polymerization (DP) 3-8. Fecal microbiota of eight-week-old infants degrades longer chains of native inulin up to DP 16. This correlates with a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium and higher production of acetate and lactate after 26 h of fermentation. Fermented FOS and native inulin attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by immature dendritic cells (DCs), but profiles and magnitude of attenuation are stronger with native inulin than with FOS. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that fermentation of FOS and native inulin is dependent on the infant's age and fructan structure. Fermentation enhances attenuating effects of pro-inflammatory responses in DCs, which depend mainly on microbial metabolites formed during fermentation.",

Diagnosis is challenging, especially in mild forms, leading to unnecessary periods of cessation of enteral feeding. This study aimed at establishing a prognosis score of enteropathy combining clinical parameters and faecal calprotectin concentration. METHODS: This prospective multicentric study included preterm neonates born at a gestational age of 33 weeks or less. Stools were collected weekly until hospital discharge, and daily in case of digestive events for calprotectin measurement (ELISA and immunochromatography) and microbiota analyses (16S rRNA gene sequencing). RESULTS: Among the 121 neonates included, 21 experienced at least one episode of enteropathy, mainly mild forms. By ELISA testing, median faecal calprotectin was 88 (8-798) microg/g faeces. No statistically significant association was found between the outset of enteropathy and maternal and neonatal characteristics, and calprotectin levels. The agreement between ELISA and immunochromatography assay was moderate (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.58, 95%CI [0.47-0.66]). Comparison of species diversity and relative bacterial abundance profiles between infants with or without enteropathy revealed no specific alterations associated with enteropathy. CONCLUSION: The study failed to propose a prognostic score of enteropathy, probably due the large inter- and intra-individual variability of faecal calprotectin in very preterm neonates.",

Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the vulnerability of human fetuses and infants to the effects of OPs because of their rapid growth and organ development, cell differentiation, and immaturity of metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prenatal exposure to OPs characterized by different physicochemical properties using non-invasive biological samples (meconium and placenta). A total of 88 placenta and 53 meconium samples were collected in Ourense, a city located in northwestern Spain, at the delivery and after birth from mothers and their infants from the University Hospital of Ourense, respectively. Selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) methodologies were used to determine the targeted OPs in the selected biological samples.

			"abstract": "Background Klebsiella pneumoniae (hereafter, Kp) is a major public health threat responsible for high levels of multidrug resistant (MDR) human infections. Besides, Kp also causes severe infections in the community, especially in Asia and Africa. Although most Kp infections are caused by endogenous intestinal carriage, little is known about the prevalence and microbiological characteristics of Kp in asymptomatic human carriage, and attached risk factors including environmental sources exposure. Methods Here, 911 pregnant women from communities in Madagascar, Cambodia, and Senegal were screened for gut colonization by Kp. Characteristics of Kp strains (antimicrobial susceptibility, genomic diversity, virulence, and resistance genes) were defined, and associated risk factors were investigated. Results Kp carriage rate was 55.9%, and Kp populations were highly heterogeneous (6 phylogroups, 325 sequence types, Simpson index 99.6%). One third of Kp isolates had acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. MDR-Kp (11.7% to 39.7%) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Kp (0.7% to 14.7%) varied among countries. Isolates with virulence genes were detected (14.5%). Environmental exposure factors including food, animal contacts, or hospitalization of household members were associated with carriage of Kp, antimicrobial resistance and hypervirulence. However, risk factors were country-specific and Kp subpopulation-specific. Conclusion This large-scale multicenter study uncovers the huge diversity of Kp in human gut carriage, demonstrates that antimicrobial resistance is widespread in communities of three low-income countries, and underlines the challenges posed by Kp colonization to the control of antimicrobial resistance.",

We aimed to systematically review evidence on maternal probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and vertical transfer of the corresponding strain to the infant gut. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and OVID were searched from inception to September 2018. Studies of maternal probiotic supplementation for a minimum duration of 2 weeks and analyses of neonatal stool samples were included. The primary outcome was presence of the specific probiotic strain in the infant stool. Electronic databases were searched for relevant studies and references were cross-checked. Risk of bias among included studies was assessed and data were extracted independently by two authors. RESULTS: Three studies were included in the review. Only one study was identified involving prenatal maternal probiotic supplementation alone. Neonatal colonization with the maternally administered probiotic was not demonstrated but supplementation with the probiotic influenced levels of a bacterial strain other than that found in the probiotic product. The other two studies identified included both prenatal and postnatal supplementation of either mother or infant. All three studies reported employing strain-specific isolation methodology to isolate the supplemented bacterial strain in infant stool but none used whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies investigating transfer of a specific probiotic bacterial strain from mother to infant were identified, showing inconclusive evidence of vertical transfer.",

In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.",

Early growth patterns can affect later neurodevelopmental and anthropometric potentials. The role of the dysbiotic gut microbiome in VLBW infant growth is unknown. Eighty-four VLBW infants were followed for six weeks after birth with weekly stool collection. DNA was extracted from samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced with Illumina MiSeq. A similar microbiota database from full-term infants was used for comparing gut microbiome and predicted metabolic pathways. The class Gammaproteobacteria increased or remained consistent over time in VLBW infants. Out of 228 metabolic pathways that were significantly different between term and VLBW infants, 133 pathways were significantly lower in VLBW infants. Major metabolic differences in their gut microbiome included pathways involved in decreased glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, reduced biosynthetic capacity, interrupted amino acid metabolism, changes that could result in increased infection susceptibility, and many other system deficiencies. Our study reveals poor postnatal growth in a VLBW cohort who had dysbiotic gut microbiota and differences in predicted metabolic pathways compared to term infants.

In this review we focus on the effect of prenatal and intrapartum maternally administered antibiotics on the infant intestinal microbiota. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. All studies reporting effect on diversity or microbiota profiles were included. RESULTS: A total of 4.030 records were encountered. A total of 24 articles were included in the final analysis. Infants from mothers exposed to antibiotics during delivery showed a decreased microbial diversity compared to non-exposed infants. The microbiota of infants exposed to antibiotics was characterised by a decreased abundance of Bacteriodetes and Bifidobacteria, with a concurrent increase of Proteobacteria. These effects were most pronounced in term vaginally born infants. CONCLUSION: Maternal administration of antibiotics seems to have profound effects on the infant gut microbiota colonisation. Interpretation of microbiota aberrations in specific populations, such as preterm and caesarean born infants, is complicated by multiple confounding factors and by lack of high quality studies and high heterogeneity in study design. Further research is needed to investigate the potential short- and long-term clinical consequences of these microbial alterations.",

Despite increasing knowledge regarding the detrimental effect of antibiotics on the gut microbiota, limited research focussed on antibiotic treatment duration. We determined the effect of short and long amoxicillin/ceftazidime administration on gut microbiota development during the immediate postnatal life of preterm and term infants. METHODS: Faeces was collected from 63 (pre) term infants at postnatal weeks one, two, three, four and six. Infants received either no (control), short-term (ST) or long-term (LT) postpartum amoxicillin/ceftazidime treatment. RESULTS: Compared to control infants, ST and LT infants' microbiota contained significantly higher abundance of Enterococcus during the first two postnatal weeks at the expense of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Short and long antibiotic treatment both allowed for microbiota restoration within the first six postnatal weeks. However, Enterococcus and Bifidobacterium abundances were affected in fewer ST than LT infants. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous amoxicillin/ceftazidime administration affects intestinal microbiota composition by decreasing the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Streptococcus, while increasing the relative abundance of Enterococcus and Lactobacillus species during the first two postnatal weeks. Thriving of enterococci at the expense of bifidobacteria and streptococci should be considered as aspect of the cost-benefit determination for antibiotic prescription.",

Bacterial communities of the newborns' stool microbiota (NEC acute group, NEC recovery group, control group, and antibiotics-free group) and of the NEC mouse model (NEC group and control group) were detected by high-throughput sequencing. Intestinal histopathological changes were observed after HE staining. The AI-2 level in the NEC acute group (44.75 [40.17~65.52]) was significantly lower than that in the control group, NEC recovery group and antibiotics-free group.

In animal experiments, the AI-2 level in feces of NEC mice (56.89 +/- 11.87) was significantly lower than that in the feces of control group mice (102.70 +/- 22.97). The microbiota compositions of NEC and control group mice at the phylum level were not significantly different. At the genus level, Klebsiella, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and Peptoclostridium abundances in the NEC group increased significantly compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05).

DESIGN: Single centre cohort study. SETTING: Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province, China. POPULATION: We studied 13 SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women diagnosed between 31 January and 9 March 2020. METHODS: We collected clinical data, vaginal secretions, stool specimens and breast milk from SARS-CoV-2-infected women during different stages of pregnancy and collected neonatal throat and anal swabs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed viral presence in different biosamples. RESULTS: Of the 13 women with COVID-19, five were in their first trimester, three in their second trimester and five in their third trimester. Of the five women in their third trimester who gave birth, all delivered live newborns. Among these five deliveries, the primary adverse perinatal outcomes included premature delivery (n = 2) and neonatal pneumonia (n = 2). One of nine stool samples was positive; all 13 vaginal secretion samples, and five throat swabs and four anal swabs collected from neonates, were negative for the novel coronavirus. However, one of three samples of breast milk was positive by viral nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 13 pregnant women with COVID-19, we observed negative viral test results in vaginal secretion specimens, suggesting that a vaginal delivery may be a safe delivery option. However, additional research is urgently needed to examine breast milk and the potential risk for viral contamination.

			"abstract": "We report on the management of infant feces in a rural village in Geita region, Tanzania. Findings discussed here emerged incidentally from a qualitative study aimed at investigating vulnerability and resilience to health challenges in rural settings. Data was gathered through semi-structured focus group discussions (FDGs) with women (n = 4; 32 participants), men (n = 2; 16 participants), and community leaders (n = 1; 8 participants). All FDGs were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti. Respondents reported feces of a child under the age of six months were considered pure compared to those of older children. Infant feces were seen as transitioning to harmful at the point when the child began to eat solid food, resulting in their stool visually changing in appearance. Caregivers reportedly used soft implements to handle infant feces due to the belief that tools with hard surfaces would physically harm the child. Infant feces were disposed in environments around the house due to the belief that disposal in latrines would prevent developmental milestones and result in other perceived negative health outcomes for the child. Changing views expressed by participants suggest a window of opportunity to implement evidence-based and culturally relevant interventions to encourage the safe disposal of infant feces.",

			"abstract": "AIM: To investigate possible association of aminopeptidase N/CD13 with other parameters of possible homeostatic mechanisms in meconium for potential use in identifying intrauterine environmental stress factors during fetal and perinatal life. METHODS: Aminopeptidase N/CD13 (APN/CD13), calprotectin (CAL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), ceruloplasmin (CER), lactoferrin (LF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were determined using ELISA kits in 115 meconium samples collected from 30 healthy full term neonates. RESULTS: Significant correlations were established between meconium APN/CD13 [mug/g] (mean +/- SD, median, range: 2.88 +/- 9.90, 0.94, 0.09-91.54) and MPO (r = 0.77, p = .0000), CER (r = 0.48, p = .0000), LF (r = 0.26, p = .005), IL-8 (r = 0.44, p = .00012) but no correlation of APN/CD13 vs CAL (r = 0.15, p > .05). With increased APN/CD13 concentrations there were increases (p < .05) in concentrations of MPO, CER, LF and L-8. CONCLUSIONS: Meconium APN/CD13 demonstrates characteristic associations with other proteins involved in the regulation of metabolic processes. The panel of APN/CD13, MPO, CER and LF may be candidate biomarker for disorders developing in utero which may have impact on health in later life.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Management of children's stools is an important aspect of achieving open defecation free communities and reduction of diarrhea. However, information regarding individual- and community- level factors associated with safe child stool disposal in Malawi is limited. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of safe child stool disposal and the associated individual- and community- level factors in Malawi. METHODS: The cross-sectional study used data from the 2015-16 Malawi Demographic Health Survey in which 6326 children aged under 2 years, nested within 850 communities, were analyzed. Individual- and community- level factors were tested for association with safe child stool disposal practice using multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: Results revealed that 85.6% of the women reported to have safely disposed of their children's stools. Women from households with improved sanitation had 36.0% greater odds of safely disposing of their children's stools compared with those from households with unimproved sanitation [(adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.65). Further, women from communities with a middle (aOR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.18-2.21) and high (aOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.14-1.84) percentage of educated women were more likely to have their children's stools safely disposed of than those from communities with a low percentage of educated women. Children's age, media exposure, and region were significantly associated with safe stool disposal. CONCLUSION: Both Individual- and community-level factors were revealed to be important factors for child stool disposal. Public health strategies designed to promote sanitation/safe child stools disposal need to conduct thorough community assessments to identify community-specific needs/barriers. Additionally, public health practitioners should take into consideration the geographical and wealth inequalities when designing programs aimed to improve safe child stood disposal.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is unknown to what extent the microbiome of preterm infants is influenced by hospital regimens including the use of different probiotics when it comes to the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). METHODS: Prospective controlled multicenter cohort study including very low birth weight infants from three neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) between October 2015 and March 2017. During this time span, stool was sampled every other day during the first two weeks and samples were subjected to amplicon-based microbiome analyses. Out of these, seventeen negative controls were processed (German Registry of Clinical Trials (No.: DRKS00009290)). RESULTS: The groups (3 x 18 infants) showed no statistically significant difference regarding gestational age, birth weight, APGAR scores and oxygen demand. 2029 different taxa were detected, including Enterococcus and Staphylococcus, as well as the probiotic genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium predominating. The bacterial load was found to increase earlier on when probiotics were used. Without probiotics administration, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium contributed only marginally to the fecal microbiome. Some infants did not respond to probiotic administration. The samples from all centers participating reached a very similar diversity after two weeks while the microbiome samples from all three centers clustered significantly yet varied from each other. CONCLUSION: Probiotics proved to be safe and initiated an earlier increase of bacterial load (with marked individual divergences), which might play a crucial role in the prevention of neonatal morbidities. Meconium was found not to be free of bacterial DNA, and oral antibiotics did not influence the fecal microbiome development negatively, and hospital regimes led to a center-specific, distinct cluster formation.",

			"article_name": "Longitudinal assessment of antibiotic resistance gene profiles in gut microbiomes of infants at risk of eczema.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: While there is increasing knowledge about the gut microbiome, the factors influencing and the significance of the gut resistome are still not well understood. Infant gut commensals risk transferring multidrug-resistant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to pathogenic bacteria. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is a worldwide public health concern. Better understanding of the naive infant gut resistome may build the evidence base for antimicrobial stewardship in both humans and in the food industry. Given the high carriage rate of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Asia, we aimed to evaluate community prevalence, dynamics, and longitudinal changes in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles and prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the intestinal microbiome of infants participating in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study, a longitudinal cohort study of pregnant women and their infants. METHODS: We analysed ARGs in the first year of life among 75 infants at risk of eczema who had stool samples collected at multiple timepoints using metagenomics. RESULTS: The mean number of ARGs per infant increased with age. The most common ARGs identified confer resistance to aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics; all infants harboured these antibiotic resistance genes at some point in the first year of life. Few ARGs persisted throughout the first year of life. Beta-lactam resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected in 4 (5.3%) and 32 (42.7%) of subjects respectively. CONCLUSION: In this longitudinal cohort study of infants living in a region with high endemic antibacterial resistance, we demonstrate that majority of the infants harboured several antibiotic resistance genes in their gut and showed that the infant gut resistome is diverse and dynamic over the first year of life.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: This paper reports on the baseline prevalence and associated risk factor findings of a pilot, longitudinal study exploring community-wide treatment of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, using albendazole plus praziquantel in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. METHOD: From three communities, at least, 658 individuals were enrolled into the study via random household selection. Prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis and STH infection were determined from stool and urine samples with a questionnaire being administered in order to explore other morbidities and risk factors. Factor analysis of household demographic variables was undertaken to generate a socioeconomic score; this was then further categorised into tertiles. Proportional-odds cumulative logit generalised estimating equation (GEE) models were used to investigate categorical ordinal intensity of infection associations with morbidity. Separately, logistic GEE models were used to investigate risk factor associations with infection prevalence. RESULTS: Both Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni were prevalent in the three communities, with the prevalence of S. haematobium ranging from 3.3% (24/679; 95% CI = 1.9-4.7) to 19% (114/632; 95% CI = 15.8-22.2) and S. mansoni ranging from 30% (202/679; 95% CI = 26.5-33.5) to 78.3% (409/536; 95% CI = 74.7-81.9). The total prevalence of STH across all three sites was negligible at 1.3% (24/1847; 95% CI = 0.8-1.9) comprising mainly hookworm (10/1847). Multivariable statistical models indicated males to be 2.3 (95% CI = 1.7-3.3) times more likely to have a high intensity S. mansoni infection and 1.5 (95% CI = 1.1-2) times more likely to have a high intensity of S. haematobium infection compared to females. There was no significant difference in the likelihood of infection with S. mansoni between adults and school age children (SAC), however S. haematobium infections were found to be 2.5 (95% CI = 1.8-3.5) times more likely to occur in school age children than in adults. Multivariable statistical models (adjusted for age and sex) indicated an association between schistosomiasis and a number of self-reported morbidity indicators (notably diarrhoea and blood in stool and urine). Low socio-economic status was also associated with SCH infection (OR: 2; 95% CI = 1.3-3.2). CONCLUSION: The communities targeted by this study showed a range of Schistosoma prevalence's of infection, from hypo-endemic through to meso-endemic and hyper-endemic. The prevalence of SCH across the different age groups in the study locations highlights the large number of individuals currently being left out of the standard morbidity control method of annual treatment of the SAC.",

This study aims to determine the frequency of Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica in children with diarrhea and identify risk factors for infection. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study in children aged 0-168 months hospitalized with diarrhea in three regions of Mozambique, from June 2014 to January 2018. Following consent, caretakers were interviewed and a single stool specimen was collected from each child to diagnose Cryptosporidium spp., G. lamblia and E. histolytica using commercial immune-enzymatic assay (TechLab, Inc, Blacksburg, VA, USA). Anthropometric data were collected from the clinical reports. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify risk factors for Cryptosporidium spp. and G. lamblia infection. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of all specimens (212/1008) presented at least one parasitic infection. Cryptosporidium spp. infection was the most common 12.0% (118/985), followed by G. lamblia 9.7% (95/983) and E. histolytica 2.0% (20/1004). Risk factors for infection by Cryptosporidium spp. were: provenience (children from Nampula province showed the highest risk, OR: 8.176; CI: 1.916-34.894; p-value < 0.01); animal contact (children with animal contact had a protective effect OR: 0.627; CI: 0.398-0.986; p-value < 0.05); underweight (children severely underweight showed a risk of 2.309; CI: 1.310-4.069; p-value < 0.05). Risk factors for infection by G. lamblia were: age (group with highest risk, 60-168 months (OR: 2.322; CI: 1.000-5.393, p-value > 0.05)); and living in a household with five or more members (OR: 2.141; CI: 1.286-3.565, p-value < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Parasitic infection is common among children with diarrhea.

Using conventional methods 55/110 (50%) samples were O typed. Using the molecular method, 72/110 (65%) were O typed, including 23/38 (61%) culture negative samples. Combining both techniques typed 88/110 (80%) of samples. Molecular typing increased detection of O128 (2-25%, p<0.001), O26 (11-16%) O45 (0-6%) and O103 (1-6%) infections. Molecular typing of STEC direct from faecal samples improved O type yield; risk of bias in epidemiological and surveillance activities may be reduced by inclusion of culture independent typing methods.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota composition is known to depend on environmental (diet, day length, infections, xenobiotic exposure) and lifestyle (alcohol/drug intake, physical activity) factors. All these factors fluctuate seasonally, especially in areas with highly variable climatic conditions between seasons. Seasonal microbiota changes were reported in several previous studies. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether there is a seasonal variability in the gut microbiota composition in Ukrainian population. In contrast to previous studies performed on small-size samples using a longitudinal design, we used cross-sectional design with a large sample size (n = 769). Determination of microbial composition at the level of major microbial phyla was performed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: The relative abundance of major taxonomic groups of gut microbiota was found to be affected by month of sampling. Actinobacteria were more abundant and Bacteroidetes were less abundant in summer-derived samples compared to those obtained during other seasons, whereas Firmicutes content was seasonally independent. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was significantly higher in summer-derived samples than in winter-derived ones. Odds to have F/B > 1 were 3.3 times higher in summer samples and 1.9 times higher in autumn samples than in winter ones; neither age, nor sex were significant confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonality of sampling could influence results of human microbiome research, thereby potentially biasing estimates. This factor must be taken into consideration in further microbiome research.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Giardia duodenalis is conventionally diagnosed in fecal samples using parasitological methods. However, sensitivity is poor when only a single sample is analyzed, due to intermittent excretion of cysts in feces. Alternatively, the serum antibodies to G. duodenalis can be used for parasite diagnosis and epidemiological studies to determine previous exposure. We compared the rate of G. duodenalis infection between serum anti-Giardia IgG and IgA antibodies and fecal examination in Brazilian children. METHODS: Fecal and serum samples were tested from 287 children at a clinical laboratory and from 187 children at daycare centers. Fecal samples were processed using conventional parasitological methods and coproantigen detection for Giardia diagnosis. Serum samples were tested using an in-house ELISA for detection of anti-Giardia IgG and IgA. RESULTS: G. duodenalis was found in 8.2% (N=39) of the 474 children analyzed. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA were 80.0% and 90.0% for IgG and 80.0% and 83.3% for IgA, respectively. The total positivity rate of anti-Giardia IgG and IgA in the sera was 13.9% (N=66) and 23.6% (N=112). The agreement between the positivity of specific antibodies and the detection of G. duodenalis in feces was moderate for ELISA-IgG, kappa index (95% CI)=0.543 (0.422-0.664), and mild for ELISA-IgA, kappa index (95% CI)=0.283 (0.162-0.404). Among the children infected with other enteroparasites, 11.6% (N=10) and 24.4% (N=21) showed reactivity to anti-Giardia IgG and to IgA, respectively. This cross-reactivity was more frequent in samples from children infected with Endolimax nana and Entamoeba coli. CONCLUSIONS: The higher frequency of specific antibody reactivity compared with G. duodenalis diagnosis in feces could reflect continuous exposure of children to G. duodenalis infection, resulting in long-lasting immunological memory and/or cross-reactivity with other intestinal amoebas.",

GBS colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract (GIT) may be a critical precursor for late-onset infection. Assessment of the rate of neonatal GBS intestinal colonization has generally relied upon culture-based methods. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture to determine the rate of GBS transmission to neonates. We hypothesized that PCR may enhance the detection of neonatal GBS colonization of the GIT, and that the rate will be higher when evaluated with PCR as compared to culture. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, in which mothers who were positive for GBS on routine screening and their healthy infants were eligible for recruitment. Newborn stool was collected after 24 h of life and before hospital discharge, and stored at -80 degrees C for culture and PCR targeting the GBS-specific surface immunogenic protein (sip) gene. Results A total of 94 mother-infant pairs were enrolled; of these pairs, stool was collected from 83 infants. Based on PCR, the overall GBS transmission rate was 3.6% (3/83). The transmission rate was 2.4% (1/41) among vaginal deliveries and 4.8% (2/42) among cesarean deliveries. The results of culture-based transmission detection were identical. Conclusion These results indicate that the rate of GBS transmission is low and that detection may not be enhanced by PCR methods.",

However, little is currently known about PeV-A infections in children with acute gastroenteritis in mainland China. In this study, we investigated the molecular epidemiology of acute gastroenteritis in Shenzhen, southern China, with an emphasis on PeV-A infections. A total of 1220 stool specimens from 1220 outpatient children under 5 years old with acute gastroenteritis were collected from January 2016 to December 2018. Viral RNA was detected by a real-time RT-PCR and PCR method. The PeV-A isolates were genotyped by sequencing the VP3/VP1 region. Of 1220 specimens, 148 (12.1%) were positive for PeV-A. The predominant genotype was PeV-A 1B (68.9%), followed by PeV-A 4 (12.2%), PeV-A 14 (6.1%), PeV-A 1A (5.4%), PeV-A 6 (2.7%), PeV-A 3 (2.7%) and PeV-A 5 (2.0%). It was found that 68.2% of PeV-A infections occurred in the summer and rainy months (June to September) in southern China. The majority of PeV-A-positive patients (97.3%) were younger than 24 months old. PeV-A coinfection with norovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus and adenovirus was found in thirty specimens (30/148, 20.3%), five specimens (5/148, 3.4%), five specimens (5/148, 3.4%), and two specimens (2/148, 1.4%), respectively. Coinfections with more than one other enteric virus were not observed in any of the PeV-A-positive specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the PeV-A isolates from Shenzhen were closely related to each other and to strains circulating in China, suggesting endemic circulation of PeV-A in China. The results of this study indicate that PeV-A is one of important pathogens of acute gastroenteritis in young children and that coinfection is a possible mode of PeV-A infection. PeV-A associated with acute gastroenteritis exhibited high genotypic diversity in Shenzhen, southern China.",

Alterations in diet and intestinal and respiratory microbiomes may have important implications for physical and psychosocial health. Diet influences the intestinal microbiome and should be considered when exploring disease-specific alterations. The concepts of gut-brain and gut-lung axes provide novel perspectives for examining chronic childhood disease(s). We established the 'Evaluating the Alimentary and Respiratory Tracts in Health and disease' (EARTH) research programme to provide a structured, holistic evaluation of children with chronic gastrointestinal and/or respiratory conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The EARTH programme provides a framework for a series of prospective, longitudinal, controlled, observational studies (comprised of individual substudies), conducted at an Australian tertiary paediatric hospital (the methodology is applicable to other settings). Children with a chronic gastrointestinal and/or respiratory condition will be compared with age and gender matched healthy controls (HC) across a 12-month period. The following will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months: (i) stool, (ii) oropharyngeal swab/sputum, (iii) semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, (iv) details of disease symptomatology, (v) health-related quality of life and (vi) psychosocial factors. Data on the intestinal and respiratory microbiomes and diet will be compared between children with a condition and HC. Correlations between dietary intake (energy, macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients), intestinal and respiratory microbiomes within each group will be explored. Data on disease symptomatology, quality of life and psychosocial factors will be compared between condition and HC cohorts.Results will be hypothesis-generating and direct future focussed studies. There is future potential for direct translation into clinical care, as diet is a highly modifiable factor.

The timing of the appearance of the first gut microbiome, and the consequences for the early life metabolome, are just starting to be defined. Here, we evaluated the gut microbiome, proteome and metabolome in 88 African-American newborns using faecal samples collected in the first few days of life. Gut bacteria became detectable using molecular methods by 16 h after birth. Detailed analysis of the three most common species, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus, did not suggest a genomic signature for neonatal gut colonization. The appearance of bacteria was associated with reduced abundance of approximately 50 human proteins, decreased levels of free amino acids and an increase in products of bacterial fermentation, including acetate and succinate. Using flux balance modelling and in vitro experiments, we provide evidence that fermentation of amino acids provides a mechanism for the initial growth of E. coli, the most common early colonizer, under anaerobic conditions. These results provide a deep characterization of the first microbes in the human gut and show how the biochemical environment is altered by their appearance.",

			"article_name": "Methylparaben in meconium and risk of maternal thyroid dysfunction, adverse birth outcomes, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parabens, which are used as a preservative in foods and personal care products, are detected in nearly 100% of human urine samples. Exposure to parabens is associated with DNA damage, male infertility, and endocrine disruption in adults, but the effects of prenatal exposure are unclear. In part, this is due to inadequate assessment of exposure in maternal urine, which may only reflect maternal rather than fetal exposure. To address this gap, we examined the association of prenatal methylparaben measured in meconium with preterm birth, gestational age, birthweight, maternal thyroid hormones, and child Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at 6-7 years. DESIGN: Data come from the GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) prospective observational pregnancy cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Participants were 345 children with data on ADHD among 394 eligible pregnancies in women age >/=18 years with no known thyroid disease before pregnancy and meconium collected at delivery. Methylparaben was measured in meconium. Birthweight, gestational age, and maternal thyroid hormones at <20 weeks gestation were measured at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke. Preterm birth was defined as vaginal birth before the 37th week of gestation. Physician diagnosis of ADHD was determined at a scheduled cohort follow-up when children were 6-7 years old or from medical records. Associations between meconium methylparaben and outcomes were estimated with logistic and linear regressions weighted on the inverse probability of exposure to account for potential confounders, including child sex, familial income, maternal education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, age, and smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. RESULTS: Methylparaben was detected in 65 meconium samples (19%), 33 children were diagnosed with ADHD (10%), and 13 children were born preterm (4%). Meconium methylparaben was associated with preterm birth (odds ratio [OR] = 4.81; 95% CI [2.29, 10.10]), decreased gestational age (beta [beta] = -0.61 weeks; 95% CI [-0.93, -0.29]) and birthweight (beta = -0.12 kg; 95% CI [-0.21, -0.03]), altered maternal TSH (relative concentration [RC] = 0.76; 95% CI [0.58, 0.99]), total T3 (RC = 0.84; 95% CI [0.75, 0.96]) and total T4 (RC = 1.10; 95% CI [1.01, 1.19]), maternal hypothyroxinemia (OR = 2.50, 95% CI [1.01, 6.22]), and child ADHD at age of 6-7 (OR = 2.33, 95% CI [1.45, 3.76]). The effect of meconium methylparaben on ADHD was partially mediated by preterm birth (20% mediation) and birthweight (13% mediation). CONCLUSIONS: Meconium methylparaben was associated with preterm birth, decreased gestational age and birthweight, maternal thyroid hormone dysfunction, and child ADHD. Parabens are a substantial health concern if causally related to these adverse outcomes.",

			"abstract": "Infant colic is a condition of unknown cause which can result in carer distress and attachment difficulties. Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota in infant colic, and certain probiotics have demonstrated possible efficacy. We aim to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in infants with colic is associated with cry/fuss time at baseline, persistence of cry/fuss at 4-week follow-up, or child behavior at 2 years of age. Fecal samples from infants with colic (n = 118, 53% male) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After examining the alpha and beta diversity of the clinical samples, we performed a differential abundance analysis of the 16S data to look for taxa that associate with baseline and future behavior, while adjusting for potential confounding variables. In addition, we used random forest classifiers to evaluate how well baseline gut microbiota can predict future crying time. Alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota was strongly influenced by birth mode, feed type, and child gender, but did not significantly associate with crying or behavioral outcomes. Several taxa within the microbiota (including Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Klebsiella) associate with colic severity, and the baseline microbiota composition can predict further crying at 4 weeks with up to 65% accuracy. The combination of machine learning findings with associative relationships demonstrates the potential prognostic utility of the infant fecal microbiota in predicting subsequent infant crying problems.",

			"abstract": "To understand the formation of initial gut microbiota, three initial fecal samples were collected from two groups of two breast milk-fed (BM1) and seven formula milk-fed (FM1) infants, and the compositional changes in gut microbiota were determined using metagenomics. Compositional change analysis during week one showed that Bifidobacterium increased from the first to the third fecal samples in the BM1 group (1.3% to 35.1%), while Klebsiella and Serratia were detected in the third fecal sample of the FM1 group (4.4% and 34.2%, respectively), suggesting the beneficial effect of breast milk intake. To further understand the compositional changes during progression from infancy to childhood (i.e., from three weeks to five years of age), additional fecal samples were collected from four groups of two breast milk-fed infants (BM2), one formula milk-fed toddler (FM2), three weaning food-fed toddlers (WF), and three solid food-fed children (SF). Subsequent compositional change analysis and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota changed from an infant-like composition to an adult-like one in conjunction with dietary changes. Interestingly, overall gut microbiota composition analyses during the period of progression from infancy to childhood suggested increasing complexity of gut microbiota as well as emergence of a new species of bacteria capable of digesting complex carbohydrates in WF and SF groups, substantiating that diet type is a key factor in determining the composition of gut microbiota. Consequently, this study may be useful as a guide to understanding the development of initial gut microbiota based on diet.",

METHODS: We used the dataset of shigellosis cases reported between January 2005 and December 2017, from Hubei Province, China. A mathematical model was developed based on the natural history and the transmission mechanism of the disease. By fitting the data using the model, transmission relative rate from person to person (b) and from reservoir to person (b(w)), and the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) were estimated. To simulate the contribution of b and b(w) during the transmission, we performed a \"knock-out\" simulation in four scenarios: A) b = 0 and b(w) = 0; B) b = 0; C) b(w) = 0; D) control (no intervention). RESULTS: A total of 130,770 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei province, among which 13 cases were dead. The median annual incidence was 19.96 per 100,000 persons (range: 5.99 per 100,000 persons - 29.47 per 100,000 persons) with a decreased trend (trend chi(2) = 25,470.27, P < 0.001). The mean values of b and b(w) were 0.0898 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0851-0.0946) and 1.1264 x 10(- 9) (95% CI: 4.1123 x 10(- 10)-1.8416 x 10(- 9)), respectively. The \"knock-out\" simulation showed that the number of cases simulated by scenario A was almost the same as scenario B, and scenario C was almost the same as scenario D. The mean value of R(eff) of shigellosis was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.13-1.25) and decreased slightly with a Linear model until it decreased to an epidemic threshold of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.65-1.34) in 2029. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of shigellosis is still in high level. The transmissibility of the disease is low in Hubei Province. The transmission would be interrupted in the year of 2029.",

Abnormal colonization or an imbalance of microbes, termed dysbiosis, is implicated in several diseases. Consequently, recent research has aimed at understanding ways to manipulate a dysbiotic microbiome during infancy to resemble a normal, healthy microbiome. However, one of the fundamental issues in microbiome research is characterizing what a \"normal\" infant microbiome is based on geography, ethnicity and cultural variations. This review provides a comprehensive account of what is currently known about the infant microbiome from a global context. In general, this review shows that the influence of cultural variations in feeding practices, delivery modes and hygiene are the biggest contributors to microbial variability.

Using a metagenomic approach, we analyzed the fecal samples from mothers and vaginally delivered infants from a control group (10 pairs) and a treatment group (10 pairs) receiving perinatal antibiotics. Antibiotic-usage had a significant impact on the main source of inoculum in the gut microbiome of newborns. The control group had significantly more species transmitted from mothers to infants (P = .03) than the antibiotic-treated group. Approximately 72% of the gut microbial population of infants at 3-7 days after birth in the control group was transmitted from their mothers, versus only 25% in the antibiotic-treated group.

Then, tobacco meconium results were compared with smoking habits during pregnancy and neonatal outcomes measures (birth weight, length, head circumference, gestational age and Apgar scores). Although meconium analysis increased identification of in-utero exposure to tobacco (17.7% meconium positive specimens vs 13.5% mothers admitting tobacco use during pregnancy), there was a statistically significant relationship between meconium results and interview answers (P < 0.001). Birth weight was significantly lower for newborns with meconium positive results in males (P = 0.023) and females (P = 0.001), while for length significance was only observed in females (P = 0.001); however, when excluding meconium specimens positive for other drugs, a statistically significant difference was only found for female weight (P = 0.045). Meconium analysis proved to be more reliable for tobacco prenatal exposure detection than maternal interview. In addition, positive meconium results increased the probability for low birth weight, especially in females.",

The use of Mini-Parasep solvent-free (SF) without ether or ethyl acetate for the clean and efficient concentration of protozoa cysts, it is a single-use device for in vitro diagnostic use only. In this work, we used Mini-Parasep SF for the detection of giardia cysts in comparison to direct smear and Merthiolate-Iodine Formaldehyde Concentration (MIFC) technique in addition to its use in antigen detection by AuNPs biomolecule loading using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) against purified Giardia antigen (PGA). As a result, Mini-Parasep SF was the most effective method for Giardia cyst detection and regarding optimization of Mini-Parasep antigen detection, our data showed increased sensitivity and specificity of nano-sandwich ELISA to 92% and 94% respectively and increased positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) to 88.64% and 95.91% respectively. In conclusion, this research provides that Mini-Parasep SF concentrator enhanced Giardia cyst detection and improved antigen preparation for AuNPs sandwich ELISA in giardiasis diagnosis. The advantages of this method are the short assay time and the raised accuracy of antigen detection providing concentrated samples without the risk of solvent use and being a disposable Mini-Parasep it helps in giardia antigen purification as well as raising the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA through binding AuNPs.",

			"abstract": "Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) may provide health benefits to infants partly by shaping the development of the early-life intestinal microbiota. In a randomized double-blinded controlled multicentric clinical trial, healthy term infants received either infant formula (control) or the same formula with two HMOs (2'-fucosyllactose and lacto-N-neotetraose; test) from enrollment (0 to 14 days) to 6 months. Then, all infants received the same follow-up formula without HMOs until 12 months of age. Breastfed infants (BF) served as a reference group. Stool microbiota at 3 and 12 months, analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, clustered into seven fecal community types (FCTs) with marked differences in total microbial abundances. Three of the four 12-month FCTs were likely precursors of the adult enterotypes. At 3 months, microbiota composition in the test group (n = 58) appeared closer to that of BF (n = 35) than control (n = 63) by microbiota alpha (within group) and beta (between groups) diversity analyses and distribution of FCTs. While bifidobacteriaceae dominated two FCTs, its abundance was significantly higher in one (FCT BiH for Bifidobacteriaceae at high abundance) than in the other (FCT Bi for Bifidobacteriaceae). HMO supplementation increased the number of infants with FCT BiH (predominant in BF) at the expense of FCT Bi (predominant in control). We explored the association of the FCTs with reported morbidities and medication use up to 12 months. Formula-fed infants with FCT BiH at 3 months were significantly less likely to require antibiotics during the first year than those with FCT Bi. Previously reported lower rates of infection-related medication use with HMOs may therefore be linked to gut microbiota community types. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01715246.)IMPORTANCE Human milk is the sole and recommended nutrition for the newborn infant and contains one of the largest constituents of diverse oligosaccharides, dubbed human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Preclinical and clinical association studies indicate that HMOs have multiple physiological functions largely mediated through the establishment of the gut microbiome. Until recently, HMOs were not available to investigate their role in randomized controlled intervention trials. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effects of 2 HMOs on establishing microbiota in newborn infants. We provide a detailed description of the microbiota changes observed upon feeding a formula with 2 HMOs in comparison to breastfed reference infants' microbiota. Then, we associate the microbiota to long-term health as assessed by prescribed antibiotic use.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is limited information on gut microbiota of neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions (CGISCs) available. METHODS: This study compared stool microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of 37 term infants with CGISCs with 36 term healthy infants (HIs). Two stool samples were collected from each infant: as soon as possible after birth (week 1) and 10-14 days of life (week 2). RESULTS: Bacterial richness and alpha diversity were comparable between CGISCs and HIs at week 1 and week 2 (all p > 0.05). Beta diversity analysis revealed that at week 1, CGISCs had similar community structures to HIs (p = 0.415). However, by week 2, community structures of CGISCs were significantly different from HIs (p = 0.003). At week 1, there were no significant differences in the relative abundances of genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides between CGISCs and HIs. At week 2, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly lower in CGISCs (mean percentage 7.21 +/- 13.49 vs. 28.96 +/- 19.6; p = 0.002). Bacteroides were also less abundant in the CGISC group (mean percentage 0.12 +/- 0.49 vs. 6.59 +/- 8.62; p = 0.039). Relative abundance of genera Pseudomonas and Escherichia-Shigella were higher in CGISCs. At week 2, stool concentrations of all SCFAs were lower in CGISCs (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During hospitalization, neonates with CGISCs develop gut dysbiosis and deficiency of SCFAs. IMPACT: During hospitalisation, neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions develop gut dysbiosis with deficiency of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides and increased abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Pseudomonas. They also have low levels of short chain fatty acids in their stools compared to healthy infants. This is the first study evaluating the gut microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing methods and stool short chain fatty acids in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions and comparing them to healthy infants.

The causative bacteria can be found in patients' intestinal tracts days before dissemination, and cohort studies suggest reduced LOS risk in breastfed preterm infants through unknown mechanisms. Reduced concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) of maternal origin within the intestinal tract of mice correlated to the translocation of a gut-resident human pathogen Escherichia coli, which spreads systemically and caused a rapid, fatal disease in pups. Translocation of Escherichia coli was associated with the formation of colonic goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs), which translocate enteric bacteria across the intestinal epithelium. Thus, maternally derived EGF, and potentially other EGFR ligands, prevents dissemination of a gut-resident pathogen by inhibiting goblet cell-mediated bacterial translocation. Through manipulation of maternally derived EGF and alteration of the earliest gut defenses, we have developed an animal model of pathogen dissemination which recapitulates gut-origin neonatal LOS.",

The risk factors for MRI include low birth weight (BW), cesarean section delivery, fetal distress, maternal diabetes, maternal hypertension, and maternal steroid use. Low BW and fetal distress were independent risk factors for MRI. Compared to the medical MRI group (n = 44), the risk factors for surgical MRI (n = 25) included males, younger gestational age, low BW, and meconium located at the small bowel. Male gender and low BW were independent risk factors for surgical MRI. Low BW and fetal distress were independent risk factors for MRI and male gender and low BW were independent risk factors for surgical MRI. In VLBW neonates, careful attention to the risk factors for MRI could minimize or avoid surgical interventions.",

			"abstract": "Nutrition during pregnancy plays an important role in maternal-neonatal health. However, the impact of specific dietary components during pregnancy on maternal gut microbiota and the potential effects on neonatal microbiota and infant health outcomes in the short term are still limited. A total of 86 mother-neonate pairs were enrolled in this study. Gut microbiota profiling on maternal-neonatal stool samples at birth was carried out by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina. Maternal dietary information and maternal-neonatal clinical and anthropometric data were recorded during the first 18 months. Longitudinal Body Mass Index (BMI) and Weight-For-Length (WFL) z-score trajectories using the World Health Organization (WHO) curves were obtained. The maternal microbiota was grouped into two distinct microbial clusters characterized by Prevotella (Cluster I) and by the Ruminococcus genus (Cluster II). Higher intakes of total dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols were observed in Cluster II compared to Cluster I. Higher intakes of plant-derived components were associated with a higher presence of the Christensellaceae family, Dehalobacterium and Eubacterium, and lower amounts of the Dialister and Campylobacter species. Maternal microbial clusters were also linked to neonatal microbiota and infant growth in a birth-dependent manner. C-section neonates from Cluster I showed the highest BMI z-score at age 18 months, along with a higher risk of overweight. Longitudinal BMI and WL z-score trajectories from birth to 18 months were shaped by maternal microbial cluster, diet, and birth mode. Diet was an important perinatal factor in early life that may impact maternal microbiota; in particular, fiber, lipids and proteins, and exert a significant effect on the neonatal microbiome and contribute to infant development during the first months of life.

			"abstract": "Background and Purpose: Early life microbiota plays a crucial role in human health by acting as a barrier from pathogens' invasion and maintaining the intestinal immune homoeostasis. Altered fecal microbiota (FM) ecology was reported in newborns affected by intestinal ischemia. Our purpose was to describe, in these patients, the FM, the mucosal microbiota (MM) and the mucosal immunity. Methods: Fourteen newborns underwent intestinal resection because of intestinal ischemia. FM and MM were determined through targeted-metagenomics, diversity assignment and Kruskal-Wallis analyses of Operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The mucosal immune cells were analyzed through cytofluorimetry. Results and Conclusion: Based on the severity intestinal injueris we identified two groups: extensive (EII) and focal intestinal ischemia (FII). FM and MM varied in EII and FII groups, showing in the EII group the predominance of Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae and the reduction of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia for both microbiota. The MM was characterized by a statistically significant reduction of Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and by a higher diversity in the EII compared to FII group. FM showed a prevalence of Proteobacteria, while the Shannon index was lower in the EII compared to FII group. An overall increment in B- and T-lymphocytes and Natural killer (NK) T-like cells was found for EII mucosal samples associated to an increment of TNF-alpha and INF-gamma expressing cells, compared to FII group. FM and MM carry specific signatures of intestinal ischemic lesions. Further research may be crucial to address the role of specific taxa in EII, expecially with reference to inflammation grade and ischemia extension.",

Despite this risk, there is limited understanding of the development of the immune system in those born prematurely, and of how this development is influenced by perinatal factors. Here we prospectively and longitudinally follow a cohort of babies born before 32 weeks of gestation. We demonstrate that preterm babies, including those born extremely prematurely (<28 weeks), are capable of rapidly acquiring some adult levels of immune functionality, in which immune maturation occurs independently of the developing heterogeneous microbiome. By contrast, we observe a reduced percentage of CXCL8-producing T cells, but comparable levels of TNF-producing T cells, from babies exposed to in utero or postnatal infection, which precedes an unstable post-natal clinical course. These data show that rapid immune development is possible in preterm babies, but distinct identifiable differences in functionality may predict subsequent infection mediated outcomes.",

We followed 24 mother-infant pairs to investigate the associations between concentrations of selected human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in breastmilk, infant faeces, and the faecal microbiota composition in healthy, breastfed infants at two, six and 12 weeks of age. Lactation duration had a significant effect on breastmilk HMO content, which decreased with time, except for 3-fucosyllactose (3FL) and Lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFP III). We confirmed that microbiota composition was strongly influenced by infant age and was associated with mode of delivery and breastmilk LNFP III concentration at two weeks, with infant sex, delivery mode, and concentrations of 3'sialyllactose (3'SL) in milk at six weeks, and infant sex and Lacto-N-hexaose (LNH) in milk at 12 weeks of age. Correlations between levels of individual breastmilk HMOs and relative abundance of OTUs found in infant faeces, including the most predominant Bifidobacterium OTUs, were weak and varied with age. The faecal concentration of HMOs decreased with age and were strongly and negatively correlated with relative abundance of OTUs within genera Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Veillonella, Lachnospiraceae Incertae Sedis, and Erysipelotrichaceae Incertae Sedis, indicating the likely importance of these taxa for HMO metabolism in vivo.",

Here we report on the phenotypic resistance profiles and ESBL genotype and virulence profiles of Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) isolated from children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Qatar (AGE). RESULTS: E. coli were isolated and characterized from 76 diarrheagenic stool positive samples, collected from hospitalized children less than 10 years old. Isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility against eighteen clinically relevant antibiotics using E-test method. Conventional PCR was performed to detect genes encoding ESBL and virulence factors. Chi-square test was performed to compare the individual antibiotic resistance between EPEC and EAEC. A significant percentage (73.7%) of isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Overall, high resistance (70%) was reported to the first-line antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline (46.4%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (42.9%). Further, 39.5% of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), with 22.4% being ESBL producers. On the other hand, all isolates were susceptible to carbapenem, fosfomycin, amikacin and colistin. The incidences of resistance to the 18 antibiotics between EPEC and EAEC were not significantly different by Pearson chi -square test (P > 0.05). Genetic analysis revealed that 88.23% of ESBL production was bla(CTX-M-G1) (bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-3)) - encoded. Several different combinations of virulence markers were observed, however, there was no specific trend among the isolates apart from absence of the bundle-forming pilus (bfpA) gene, which encodes the type IV fimbriae in EPEC adherence factor (EAF) plasmid (pEAF), among all EPEC (atypical). 15% of the EAEC strains were positive for a combination of astA, aap & capU, while 10% were positive for three different combinations. The aap, aatA, capU and aggR virulence genes showed the highest frequency of 65, 60, 55 and 55% respectively. Others genes, east, astA, and aai, showed frequencies of 35, 30 and 20% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical EPEC and EAEC were the primary etiological agents of diarrhea in children among DEC pathotypes. Our results indicated high rate of antimicrobial resistance pattern of DEC strains, which necessities the development of regulatory programs and reporting systems of antimicrobial resistance in DEC and other AGE-associated bacteria to insure effective control of diarrheal diseases. Results from this study demand a further research on identifying the phenotypic and genotypic profiles of more DEC pathotypes in various clinical samples.",

			"abstract": "Nutritional factors and infectious agents may contribute to paediatric growth deficits in low- and middle-income countries; however, the contribution of enteric pathogens is only beginning to be understood. We analysed the stool from children <5 years old from an open cohort, cluster-randomised controlled trial of a point-of-collection water chlorinator in urban Bangladesh. We compared the presence/absence of 15 enteric pathogens detected via multiplex, molecular methods in the stool with concurrent Z-scores/Z-score cut-offs (-2 standard deviations (s.d.)) for height-for-age (HAZ/stunting), weight-for-age (WAZ/underweight) and weight-for-height (WHZ/wasting), adjusted for sociodemographic and trial-related factors, and measured caregiver-reported diarrhoea. Enteric pathogen prevalence in the stool was high (88% had >/=1 enteric pathogen, most commonly Giardia spp. (40%), Salmonella enterica (33%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (28%) and Shigella spp. (27%)) while reported 7-day diarrhoea prevalence was 6%, suggesting high subclinical infection rates. Many children were stunted (26%) or underweight (24%). Adjusted models suggested Giardia spp. detection was associated with lower HAZ (-0.22 s.d., 95% CI -0.44 to 0.00; prevalence ratio for stunting: 1.39, 95% CI 0.94-2.06) and potentially lower WAZ. No pathogens were associated with reported diarrhoea in adjusted models. Giardia spp. carriage may be associated with growth faltering, but not diarrhoea, in this and similar low-income settings. Stool-based enteric pathogen detection provides a direct indication of previous exposure that may be useful as a broader endpoint of trials of environmental interventions.",

OBJECTIVE: To complete a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing endotracheal intubation and suctioning to immediate resuscitation without intubation for non-vigorous infants born at >/=34 weeks gestation delivered through MSAF. DATA SOURCES: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and other registries were searched from 1966 to November 7, 2019. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers in 2 stages. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers extracted data, appraised risk of bias, and assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence for each outcome. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included 581 patients and one observational study included 231 patients. No significant differences were observed between the group treated with tracheal suctioning compared with immediate resuscitation for survival at discharge (4 RCTs; risk ratio [RR]\u202f=\u202f1.01; 95 % CI, 0.96-1.06; p\u202f=\u202f0.69; observational study; no deaths), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and meconium aspiration syndrome. LIMITATIONS: The certainty of evidence was low for survival at discharge and very low for all other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: For non-vigorous newborns delivered through MSAF, there is insufficient evidence to suggest routine immediate direct laryngoscopy with tracheal suctioning. PROSPERO: CRD42019122778.

Fetal Micrococcus luteus, isolated only in the presence of monocytes, grew on placental hormones, remained viable within antigen presenting cells, limited inflammation ex vivo and possessed genomic features linked with survival in the fetus.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Norovirus and rotavirus are the dominant pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis in children. To quantify their natural disease burden and transmission, we prospectively monitored households in an endemic setting in the Netherlands, a high-income country that does not have a rotavirus vaccination programme. METHODS: We did a prospective, household survey-based cohort study in the Netherlands. Randomly selected households from the Dutch Population Register were invited to participate if they had at least three household members, including a child younger than 2 years. A member of each household was asked to record the gastrointestinal symptoms of all household members every day for 10 consecutie weeks using an interactive smartphone application. Real-time detection of acute gastroenteritis onset on the basis of entered symptoms activated requests for the case and one other household member to complete disease questionnaires and provide stool samples. Stool samples were analysed by real-time PCR for norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, and astrovirus. We calculated the per-pathogen proportion of households with at least one secondary acute gastroenteritis episode (epidemiologically but not microbiologically linked), the probability of a secondary episode in household members at risk (secondary attack rate), and the microbiologically confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission rates. FINDINGS: During two seasons (January to March) in 2016 and 2017, 30 660 households were invited to participate, of which 604 households including 2298 individuals were enrolled. 697 acute gastroenteritis episodes were detected in 358 households, with samples obtained from 609 (87%) of 697 episodes. Norovirus (150 [25%] of 609 cases) and rotavirus (91 [15%] cases) were most frequently detected. Astrovirus was detected in 50 (8%) samples and adenovirus 40/41 in 24 (4%) samples. Overall disease severity was higher in patients with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis than those with norovirus-positive acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus led to higher disease burden in adults than did rotavirus. Following an index case, a secondary acute gastroenteritis episode occurred in 34 (35%) of 96 households for norovirus and 26 (46%) of 56 households for rotavirus. Secondary attack rates were 15% (37 of 244 participants) for norovirus and 28% (33 of 120 participants) for rotavirus and asymptomatic transmission rates were 51% (52 of 102 household members) for norovirus and 22% (12 of 55 household members) for rotavirus. The microbiologically confirmed symptomatic transmission rate for norovirus was 10% (25 of 254 household members) and 18% for rotavirus (21 of 119 household members). INTERPRETATION: In households with young family members in a setting without rotavirus vaccination, norovirus is the dominant acute gastroenteritis pathogen, but rotavirus is associated with more severe disease. There was substantial within-household transmission, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The study provides key quantities on transmission, which can inform vaccine policy decisions and act as a baseline for impact evaluations in high-income settings.

Pregnant women with CKD present an additional challenge in that they are at increased risk for adverse events such as preterm birth. Exposure to environmental toxicants, such as methylmercury, may exacerbate maternal disease and increase the risk of adverse fetal outcomes. We hypothesized that fetuses of mothers with CKD are more susceptible to accumulation of methylmercury than fetuses of healthy mothers. The current data show that when mothers are in a state of renal insufficiency, uptake of mercury in fetal kidneys is enhanced significantly. Accumulation of Hg in fetal kidneys may be related to the flow of amniotic fluid, maternal handling of Hg, and/or underdeveloped mechanisms for cellular export and urinary excretion. The results of this study indicate that renal insufficiency in mothers leads to significant alterations in the way toxicants such as mercury are handled by maternal and fetal organs.",

			"abstract": "Understanding when and why new species are recruited into microbial communities is a formidable problem with implications for managing microbial systems, for instance by helping us better understand whether a probiotic or pathogen would be expected to colonize a human microbiome. Much theory in microbial temporal dynamics is focused on how phylogenetic relationships between microbes impact the order in which those microbes are recruited; for example, species that are closely related may competitively exclude each other. However, several recent human microbiome studies have observed closely related bacteria being recruited into microbial communities in short succession, suggesting that microbial community assembly is historically contingent, but competitive exclusion of close relatives may not be important. To address this, we developed a mathematical model that describes the order in which new species are detected in microbial communities over time within a phylogenetic framework. We use our model to test three hypothetical assembly modes: underdispersion (species recruitment is more likely if a close relative was previously detected), overdispersion (recruitment is more likely if a close relative has not been previously detected), and the neutral model (recruitment likelihood is not related to phylogenetic relationships among species). We applied our model to longitudinal human microbiome data, and found that for the individuals we analyzed, the human microbiome generally follows the underdispersion (i.e., nepotism) hypothesis. Exceptions were oral communities and the fecal communities of two infants that had undergone heavy antibiotic treatment. None of the datasets we analyzed showed statistically significant phylogenetic overdispersion.",

			"abstract": "Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of infection to a mother and neonate, but antibiotic-mediated maternal and neonatal microbiota dysbiosis increases other health risks to newborn infants. We studied the impact of perinatal antibiotic prophylaxis on the microbiota in mothers and newborns with full-term or preterm delivery. Ninety-eight pregnant women and their neonates were divided into the following four groups: full term without antibiotic exposure (FT), full term with antibiotic exposure (FTA), preterm without antibiotic exposure (PT), and preterm with antibiotic exposure (PTA). Bacterial composition was analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from maternal vaginal swabs (V) and neonatal meconium (F). The results showed that in maternal vaginal and neonatal meconium microbiota, FT and PT groups had a higher load of Lactobacillus spp. than did the FTA and PTA groups. In addition, whether in the mother or newborn, the dissimilarity in microbiota between FT and PT was the lowest compared to that between other groups. Compared to the FT and PT groups, the dissimilarity in microbial structures between the vagina and meconium decreased in the FTA and PTA groups. The health outcome of infants reveals an association between early-onset sepsis and antibiotic-mediated microbiota dysbiosis. In conclusion, perinatal antibiotic exposure is related to the establishment of gut microbiota and health risks in newborns. Promoting the rational usage of antibiotics with pregnant women will improve neonatal health.IMPORTANCE Perinatal antibiotic prophylaxis is an effective method for preventing group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection in newborns. Antibiotic exposure unbalances women's vaginal microbiota, which is associated with the establishment of the newborn gut microbiota. However, the influence of perinatal antibiotic exposure on neonatal gut microbiota colonization and health outcomes remains unclear. In this study, we found that perinatal antibiotic exposure induced microbiota dysbiosis in a woman's vagina and the neonatal gut, and we highlight a significant decrease in the abundance of Lactobacillus spp. The influence of antibiotic use on the microbiota was greater than that from gestational age. Additionally, full-term newborns without antibiotic exposure had no evidence of early-onset sepsis, whereas in full-term or preterm newborns with antibiotic exposure before birth, at least one infant was diagnosed with early-onset sepsis. These results suggest an association between perinatal antibiotic exposure and microbial dysbiosis in maternal vaginal and neonatal gut environments, which may be related to the occurrence of early-onset sepsis.",

Whether specific toxigenic strains are responsible is unknown, as is the extent of diversity of strains in healthy premature babies. We investigated the C. perfringens carrier status of premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, factors influence this status, and the toxic potential of the strains. METHODS: C. perfringens was isolated by culture from faecal samples from 333 infants and their toxin gene profiles analysed by PCR. A survival analysis was used to identify factors affecting probability of carriage. Competitive growth experiments were used to explore the results of the survival analysis. RESULTS: 29.4% of infants were colonized with C. perfringens before they left hospital. Three factors were inversely associated with probability of carriage: increased duration of maternal milk feeds, CPAP oxygen treatment and antibiotic treatment. C. perfringens grew poorly in breast milk and was significantly outperformed by Bifidobacterium infantis, whether grown together or separately. Toxin gene screening revealed that infants carried isolates positive for collagenase, perfringolysin O, beta 2, beta, becA/B, netB and enterotoxin toxin genes, yet none were observed to be associated with the development of NEC. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately a third of preterm infants are colonised 3 weeks after birth with toxin gene-carrying C. perfringens. We speculate that increased maternal breast milk, oxygen and antibiotic treatment creates an environment in the gut hostile to growth of C. perfringens. Whilst potentially toxigenic C. perfringens isolates were frequent, no toxin type was associated with NEC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01102738, registered 13th April 2010.",

Globally, for example, more than 1.4 million pregnancies in 2015 have been burdened with antiretroviral drugs due to an increasing number of HIV-positive women treated with these drugs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In most cases, the fetus is exposed to much higher drug doses in utero than the newborn nursed by the mother. Drug transfer through the placenta takes place by passive diffusion, active transport, or facilitated transport, and drug concentrations in the fetal circulation may be comparable to that in the mother's blood concentration. The excretion of drugs into breastmilk predominantly occurs by passive diffusion, allowing only the non-protein-bound fraction of the blood drug concentration to penetrate. Drug agencies in the United States and Europe highly recommend performing clinical trials in pregnant or breastfeeding women. However, only a few drugs have reported statistically sound data in these patient groups. Most available results concerning pregnancy are obtained from observational studies after birth, assessing outcomes in the newborn or by measuring drug concentrations in the mother and umbilical cord blood. In the case of the lactation period, some studies have evaluated drug concentrations in breastmilk and blood of the mother and/or infant. In this review, exposure to antiretrovirals, immunosuppressants used after solid organ transplantation, and antiepileptics during pregnancy and lactation has been discussed in detail.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), also called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is a major consequence of preterm birth, but the role of the microbiome in its development remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed the progression of the bacterial community in ventilated preterm infants over time in the upper and lower airways, and assessed the gut-lung axis by comparing bacterial communities in the upper and lower airways with stool findings. Finally, we assessed whether the bacterial communities were associated with lung inflammation to suggest dysbiosis. METHODS: We serially sampled multiple anatomical sites including the upper airway (nasopharyngeal aspirates), lower airways (tracheal aspirate fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and the gut (stool) of ventilated preterm-born infants. Bacterial DNA load was measured in all samples and sequenced using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: From 1102 (539 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 276 tracheal aspirate fluid, 89 bronchoalveolar lavage, 198 stool) samples from 55 preterm infants, 352 (32%) amplified suitably for 16S RNA gene sequencing. Bacterial load was low at birth and quickly increased with time, but was associated with predominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all sample types. There was dissimilarity in bacterial communities between the upper and lower airways and the gut, with a separate dysbiotic inflammatory process occurring in the lower airways of infants. Individual OTUs were associated with increased inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that targeted treatment of the predominant organisms, including those not routinely treated, such as Ureaplasma spp., may decrease the development of CLD in preterm-born infants.",

We used next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: The newborns who later developed infantile colic (n = 19) had a lower relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus and the phylum Firmicutes in the first stool than those who remained healthy (n = 139). By using all microbiome data, random forest algorithm classified newborn with subsequent colic and those who remained healthy with area under the curve of 0.66 (SD 0.03) as compared to that of shuffled samples (P value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, population-based study, the microbiome of the first-pass meconium was associated with subsequent infantile colic.

To increase our knowledge about the involvement of the gut microbiota in LOS, we analyzed fecal samples from septic infants without a CVC. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, fecal samples were collected daily from all infants born at </=30 weeks gestation. Fecal VOC profiles up to 3 days prior to sepsis onset from infants with non-catheter-related LOS were compared with profiles from non-septic controls by means of High-Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometry. RESULTS: In total, 104 fecal samples were analyzed. Fecal VOC profiles allowed for discrimination between non-catheter-related LOS cases (n = 24) and matched controls (n = 25). Discriminative accuracy increased after focusing on center of origin (area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity; 0.95, 100%, 83%) and after focusing on LOS cases caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.95, 100%, 78%), the most cultured pathogen (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: Fecal VOC profiles of preterm LOS infants without a CVC differed from matched controls underlining the increasing notion that aberrations in gut microbiota composition and activity may play a role in LOS etiology.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Conventional routine PCR testing for gastrointestinal infections is generally based on pathogen related panels specifically requested by clinicians and can be erroneous and time consuming. The BioFire FilmArray gastrointestinal (GI) panel combines 22 pathogens into a single cartridge-based test on a random-access system, thereby reducing the turnaround time to less than 2 hours. We described the clinical impact of implementing the BioFire FilmArray on patients with gastroenteritis in our hospital. METHODS: Patients attending a Dutch tertiary care center (Radboud University Medical Center), from whom stool samples were obtained, were eligible for inclusion. The clinicians selected one or a combination of different routinely performed PCR panels (bacterial panel, viral panel, clostridium testing, and three parasitic panels) based on clinical history and symptoms. All samples were in parallel tested with the FilmArray. We retrospectively collected patient data regarding infection control and patient management to assess the potential impact of implementing the FilmArray. RESULTS: In total 182 patients were included. Routine PCR detected one or more pathogens in 52 (28.6%) patients compared to 72 (39.6%) using the FilmArray. Turnaround time (including transport) decreased from median 53 hours for the routine PCR to 16 hours for the FilmArray. Twenty-six patients could have been removed from isolation 29 hours sooner, 3.6 antibiotic days could have been saved and in five patients additional imaging testing (including colonoscopies) could have been prevented. CONCLUSION: The theoretical implementation of the BioFire FilmArray GI panel in patients with clinical suspicion of gastroenteritis resulted in a significant better patient management.",

			"abstract": "The neonatal period, during which the initial gut microbiota is acquired, is a critical phase. The healthy development of the infant's microbiome can be interrupted by external perturbations, like antibiotics, which are associated with profound effects on the gut microbiome and various disorders later in life. The aim of this study was to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota and the effect of antibiotic exposure during the first three months of life in term infants. Fecal samples were collected from healthy infants and infants who received antibiotics in the first week of life at one week, one month, and three months after birth. Microbial composition was analyzed using IS-pro and compared between antibiotics-treated and untreated infants. In total, 98 infants, divided into four groups based on feeding type and delivery mode, were analyzed. At one week of age, samples clustered into two distinct groups, which were termed \"settler types\", based on their Bacteroidetes abundance. Caesarean-born infants belonged to the low-Bacteroidetes settler type, but vaginally-born infants were divided between the two groups. The antibiotics effect was assessed within a subgroup of 45 infants, vaginally-born and exclusively breastfed, to minimize the effect of other confounders. Antibiotics administration resulted in lower Bacteroidetes diversity and/or a delay in Bacteroidetes colonization, which persisted for three months, and in a differential development of the microbiota. Antibiotics resulted in pronounced effects on the Bacteroidetes composition and dynamics. Finally, we hypothesize that stratification of children's cohorts based on settler types may reveal group effects that might otherwise be masked.",

The pleomorphic nature of the protozoon and the lack of understanding a possible pathogenesis have led to confusion regarding its clinical significance. The aim of the study was to shed light on clinical characteristics of pediatric patients in Swiss children with a positive stool sample for Blastocystis, in order to provide recommendations for a practical approach for the clinician to know whom, when, and how to test. This is a retrospective study of pediatric patients, whose stool has been tested positive for Blastocystis in the last 10 years in northern Switzerland. A total of 4047 stool samples, belonging to 1887 different patients, were analyzed; 240 stool samples (of 160 patients) were tested positive for Blastocystis. On average, 2.2 (CI 1.98-2.35) stool samples per patient were analyzed, of which 1.48 (CI 1.36-1.61) were positive for Blastocystis. In 63% abdominal pain was the leading symptom, while in 17.5% it was an accidental finding without symptoms. There was a high significance in correlation of abdominal pain and chronicity (p < 0.0001) but none in diarrhea (p = 0.082) nor nausea/vomiting or other symptoms and chronicity. Followed by Entamoeba coli (8%), 26.3% of the patients with Blastocystis had a co-infection with another parasite, mostly Endolimax nana (13%).Conclusion: Carriage of Blastocystis is common; therefore, only children/teenagers at risk for a symptomatic Blastocystis infection should be tested. There is a good correlation between Blastocystis and chronic abdominal pain. Children with abdominal symptoms persisting over 4 weeks should have two different stool samples analyzed. No screening after travels/immigration is recommended.What is Known:* Blastocystis has a worldwide distribution.* The clinical significance is unclear.What is New:* Based on retrospective data, we recommend to only test children/teenagers with chronic abdominal pain for Blastocystis.* Two different stool samples should be examined by microscopy; serological investigations are not warranted.",

Their role in gastroenteritis is controversial, as they have been identified in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. The aim of the study was to investigate novel HAstV in a gastroenteritis case-control study including a pediatric population in Spain over a one-year period. We included stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis and negative results for viruses screened by routine diagnostics, and stool samples of control subjects who sought for a routine medical consultation. All samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR assays for novel HAstV. An additional screening for rotavirus, norovirus GI, GII, sapovirus, classic HAstV and adenovirus was also performed for the control group. Overall, 23/363 stool samples from case patients (6.3%) and 8/199 stool samples from control patients (4%) were positive for >/=1 novel HAstV. MLB1 was predominant (64.5% of positives).

No difference was observed in the prevalence of novel HAstV between the case and control groups (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.68-5.45; p = 0.30). Nevertheless, MLB genome copy numbers/ml of fecal suspension was significantly higher in the control group than in the case group (p = 0.008). In our study, we identified a lack of association between novel HAstV and gastroenteritis in the studied population, which could indicate a potential role of reservoir for children, especially given the higher viral load observed in the asymptomatic group for some of them.",

However, study of the endospores in gut microbiota is limited due to difficulties of culturing and numerous unknown germination factors. In this study we propose a new method for culture-independent characterization of endospores in stool samples. We have enriched DNA of spore-forming bacterial species from stool samples of 40 mother-child pairs from a previously described mother-child cohort. The samples were exposed to a two-step purification process comprising ethanol and ethidium monoazide (EMA) treatment to first kill vegetative cells and to subsequently eliminate their DNA from the samples. The composition of the ethanol-EMA resistant DNA was characterized by 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the Clostridia class (OTU1: Romboutsia, OTU5: Peptostreptococcaceae and OTU14: Clostridium senso stricto) and one belonging to the Bacillus class (OTU20: Turicibacter) were significantly more abundant in the samples from mothers and children after ethanol-EMA treatment than in those treated with ethanol only. No correlation was observed between ethanol-EMA resistant OTUs detected in children and in their mothers, which indicates that a low level of spore-forming species are shared between mothers and their children. Anaerobic ethanol-resistant bacteria were isolated from all mothers and all children over 1 year of age. Generally, in 70% of the ethanol-treated samples used for anaerobic culturing, 16S rRNA gene sequences of bacterial isolates corresponded to OTUs detected in these samples after EMA treatment. We report a new DNA-based method for the characterization of endospores in gut microbiota. Our method has high degree of correspondence to the culture-based method, although it requires further optimization. Our results also indicate a high turnover of endospores in the gut during the first two years of life, perhaps with a high environmental impact.",

			"article_name": "Genome-Wide Association Study of Cryptosporidiosis in Infants Implicates PRKCA.",
			"abstract": "Diarrhea is a major cause of both morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among young children. Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrhea in children, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where it is responsible for over 200,000 deaths per year. Beyond the initial clinical presentation of diarrhea, it is associated with long-term sequelae such as malnutrition and neurocognitive developmental deficits. Risk factors include poverty and overcrowding, and yet not all children with these risk factors and exposure are infected, nor do all infected children develop symptomatic disease. One potential risk factor to explain these differences is their human genome. To identify genetic variants associated with symptomatic cryptosporidiosis, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) examining 6.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 873 children from three independent cohorts in Dhaka, Bangladesh, namely, the Dhaka Birth Cohort (DBC), the Performance of Rotavirus and Oral Polio Vaccines in Developing Countries (PROVIDE) study, and the Cryptosporidiosis Birth Cohort (CBC). Associations were estimated separately for each cohort under an additive model, adjusting for length-for-age Z-score at 12 months of age, the first two principal components to account for population substructure, and genotyping batch. The strongest meta-analytic association was with rs58296998 (P = 3.73 x 10(-8)), an intronic SNP and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA). Each additional risk allele conferred 2.4 times the odds of Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhea in the first year of life. This genetic association suggests a role for protein kinase C alpha in pediatric cryptosporidiosis and warrants further investigation.IMPORTANCE Globally, diarrhea remains one of the major causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality. The initial symptoms of diarrhea can often lead to long-term consequences for the health of young children, such as malnutrition and neurocognitive developmental deficits. Despite many children having similar exposures to infectious causes of diarrhea, not all develop symptomatic disease, indicating a possible role for human genetic variation. Here, we conducted a genetic study of susceptibility to symptomatic disease associated with Cryptosporidium infection (a leading cause of diarrhea) in three independent cohorts of infants from Dhaka, Bangladesh. We identified a genetic variant within protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA) associated with higher risk of cryptosporidiosis in the first year of life. These results indicate a role for human genetics in susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis and warrant further research to elucidate the mechanism.",

Here we investigated how the maternal diet affects HMO biosynthesis and how any diet-induced HMO alterations influence the infant gut microbiome and immunity. Using capillary electrophoresis and MS-based analyses, we extracted and measured HMOs from breast milk samples and then correlated their levels with results from validated 24-h diet recall surveys and breast milk fatty acids. We found that fruit intake and unsaturated fatty acids in breast milk were positively correlated with an increased absolute abundance of numerous HMOs, including 16 sulfonated HMOs we identified here in humans for the first time. The diet-derived monosaccharide 5-N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) was unambiguously detected in all samples. To gain insights into the potential impact of Neu5Gc on the infant microbiome, we used a constrained ordination approach and identified correlations between Neu5Gc levels and Bacteroides spp. in infant stool. However, Neu5Gc was not associated with marked changes in infant immune markers, in contrast with sulfonated HMOs, whose expression correlated with suppression of two major Th2 cytokines, IL-10 and IL-13. The findings of our work highlight the importance of maternal diet for HMO biosynthesis and provide as yet unexplored targets for future studies investigating interactions between HMOs and the intestinal microbiome and immunity in infants.",

S. epidermidis was present in the fecal samples of all the infants in, at least, one sampling time at concentrations ranging from 6.5 to 7.8 log10 CFU/g. Initially, 344 isolates were obtained and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling allowed the reduction of the collection to 101 strains. Among them, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) profiling showed the presence of 32 different sequence types (ST). Globally, most of the STs to hospital-adapted high-risk clones and belonged to clonal complexes (CC) associated to the hospital environment, such as CC2.

Infants with a hematocrit <30% had intestinal microbiomes that diverged toward Proteobacteria dominance and low diversity after the first postnatal month. The microbiome changes were also related to the severity of anemia.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The degree of protection conferred by natural immunity is unknown for many enteropathogens, but it is important to support the development of enteric vaccines. METHODS: We used the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox model to estimate the effects of previous infections on the incidence of subsequent subclinical infections and diarrhea in children under 2 using quantitative molecular diagnostics in the MAL-ED cohort. We used cross-pathogen negative control associations to correct bias due to confounding by unmeasured heterogeneity of exposure and susceptibility. RESULTS: Prior rotavirus infection was associated with a 50% lower hazard (calibrated hazard ratio [cHR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.62) of subsequent rotavirus diarrhea. Strong protection was evident against Cryptosporidium diarrhea (cHR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51). There was also protection due to prior infections for norovirus GII (cHR against diarrhea, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.91), astrovirus (cHR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.81), and Shigella (cHR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.95). Minimal protection was observed for other bacteria, adenovirus 40/41, and sapovirus. CONCLUSIONS: Natural immunity was generally stronger for the enteric viruses than bacteria, potentially due to less antigenic diversity. Vaccines against major causes of diarrhea may be feasible but likely need to be more immunogenic than natural infection.",

			"abstract": "Human gut microbiota development has been associated with healthy growth but understanding the determinants of community assembly and composition is a formidable challenge. We cultured bacteria from serially collected fecal samples from a healthy infant; 34 sequenced strains containing 103,102 genes were divided into two consortia representing earlier and later stages in community assembly during the first six postnatal months. The two consortia were introduced alone (singly), or sequentially in different order, or simultaneously into young germ-free mice fed human infant formula. The pattern of fitness of bacterial strains observed across the different colonization conditions indicated that later-phase strains substantially outcompete earlier-phase strains, although four early-phase members persist. Persistence was not determined by order of introduction, suggesting that priority effects are not prominent in this model. To characterize succession in the context of the metabolic potential of consortium members, we performed in silico reconstructions of metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate utilization and amino acid and B-vitamin biosynthesis, then quantified the fitness (abundance) of strains in serially collected fecal samples and their transcriptional responses to different histories of colonization. Applying feature-reduction methods disclosed a set of metabolic pathways whose presence and/or expression correlates with strain fitness and that enable early-stage colonizers to survive during introduction of later colonizers. The approach described can be used to test the magnitude of the contribution of identified metabolic pathways to fitness in different community contexts, study various ecological processes thought to govern community assembly, and facilitate development of microbiota-directed therapeutics.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Due to the global increase in obesity rates and success of bariatric surgery in weight reduction, an increasing number of women now present pregnant with a previous bariatric procedure. This study investigates the extent of bariatric-associated metabolic and gut microbial alterations during pregnancy and their impact on fetal development. DESIGN: A parallel metabonomic (molecular phenotyping based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and gut bacterial (16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing) profiling approach was used to determine maternal longitudinal phenotypes associated with malabsorptive/mixed (n=25) or restrictive (n=16) procedures, compared with women with similar early pregnancy body mass index but without bariatric surgery (n=70). Metabolic profiles of offspring at birth were also analysed. RESULTS: Previous malabsorptive, but not restrictive, procedures induced significant changes in maternal metabolic pathways involving branched-chain and aromatic amino acids with decreased circulation of leucine, isoleucine and isobutyrate, increased excretion of microbial-associated metabolites of protein putrefaction (phenylacetlyglutamine, p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate), and a shift in the gut microbiota. The urinary concentration of phenylacetylglutamine was significantly elevated in malabsorptive patients relative to controls (p=0.001) and was also elevated in urine of neonates born from these mothers (p=0.021). Furthermore, the maternal metabolic changes induced by malabsorptive surgery were associated with reduced maternal insulin resistance and fetal/birth weight. CONCLUSION: Metabolism is altered in pregnant women with a previous malabsorptive bariatric surgery. These alterations may be beneficial for maternal outcomes, but the effect of elevated levels of phenolic and indolic compounds on fetal and infant health should be investigated further.",

			"article_name": "Fecal dysbiosis in infants with cystic fibrosis is associated with early linear growth failure.",
			"abstract": "Most infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) have pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that results in nutrient malabsorption and requires oral pancreatic enzyme replacement. Newborn screening for CF has enabled earlier diagnosis, nutritional intervention and enzyme replacement for these infants, allowing most infants with CF to achieve their weight goals by 12 months of age(1). Nevertheless, most infants with CF continue to have poor linear growth during their first year of life(1). Although this early linear growth failure is associated with worse long-term respiratory function and survival(2,3), the determinants of body length in infants with CF have not been defined. Several characteristics of the CF gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including inflammation, maldigestion and malabsorption, may promote intestinal dysbiosis(4,5). As GI microbiome activities are known to affect endocrine functions(6,7), the intestinal microbiome of infants with CF may also impact growth. We identified an early, progressive fecal dysbiosis that distinguished infants with CF and low length from infants with CF and normal length. This dysbiosis included altered abundances of taxa that perform functions that are important for GI health, nutrient harvest and growth hormone signaling, including decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased abundance of Proteobacteria. Thus, the GI microbiota represent a potential therapeutic target for the correction of low linear growth in infants with CF.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of antibiotics on infant gut microbiota are unclear. We hypothesized that the use of common antibiotics results in long-term aberration in gut microbiota. METHODS: Antibiotic-naive infants were prospectively recruited when hospitalized because of a respiratory syncytial virus infection. Composition of fecal microbiota was compared between those receiving antibiotics during follow-up (prescribed at clinicians' discretion because of complications such as otitis media) and those with no antibiotic exposure. Fecal sampling started on day 1, then continued at 2-day intervals during the hospital stay, and at 1, 3 and 6 months at home. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three fecal samples from 40 patients (median age 2.3 months at baseline; 22 exposed to antibiotics) were available for microbiota analyses. A single course of amoxicillin or macrolide resulted in aberration of infant microbiota characterized by variation in the abundance of bifidobacteria, enterobacteria and clostridia, lasting for several months. Recovery from the antibiotics was associated with an increase in clostridia. Occasionally, antibiotic use resulted in microbiota profiles associated with inflammatory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use in infants modifies especially bifidobacterial levels. Further studies are warranted whether administration of bifidobacteria will provide health benefits by normalizing the microbiota in infants receiving antibiotics.",

To better understand the impact of breastfeeding on Campylobacter infection in infants in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we examined fecal microbial compositions, bacterial isolates, and their carbohydrate metabolic pathways in Campylobacter-positive infants <1 year of age from the Global Enterics Multicenter Study. Exclusively breastfed infants with diarrhea exhibited high Campylobacter abundances, and this negatively correlated with bacterial carbohydrate metabolism. Although C. jejuni and Campylobacter coli are prevalent among these infants, the second most abundant Campylobacter species was a new species, which we named \"Candidatus Campylobacter infans.\" Asymptomatic Campylobacter carriers also possess significantly different proportions of specific gut microbes compared to diarrheal cases. These findings provide insight into Campylobacter infections in infants in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and help inform strategies aimed at eliminating campylobacteriosis in these areas.IMPORTANCECampylobacter is the primary cause of bacterial diarrhea in the United States and can lead to the development of the postinfectious autoimmune neuropathy known as Guillain-Barre syndrome. Also, drug-resistant campylobacters are becoming a serious concern both locally and abroad. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), infection with Campylobacter is linked to high rates of morbidity, growth stunting, and mortality in children, and breastfeeding is important for infant nutrition, development, and protection against infectious diseases. In this study, we examined the relationship between breastfeeding and Campylobacter infection and demonstrate the increased selection for C. jejuni and C. coli strains unable to metabolize fucose. We also identify a new Campylobacter species coinfecting these infants with a high prevalence in five of the seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia examined. These findings indicate that more detailed studies are needed in LMICs to understand the Campylobacter infection process in order to devise a strategy for eliminating this pathogenic microbe.",

A total of 2014 diarrheal stool samples were collected from January 2016 to May 2017 from pediatrics patients of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed by identification of S. flexneri through biochemical, serological, and molecular methods. The overall prevalence of Shigella species was found to be 7.9% (n = 160). The predominant Shigella specie was S. flexneri (n = 155, 96.8%) followed by S. boydii (n = 5, 3.1%). Interestingly, no sample was found positive for S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae. The majority of Shigellosis cases occurred from June to September. Potential risk factors related with Shigellosis were unhygienic latrine usage, bad hand washing, and consumption of unhygienic food and water, and pipe leakage in the sewage system. In this study, we have observed a high number of Shigellosis cases especially those caused by S. flexneri. It is suggested that effective health awareness programs should be organized by the regional health authorities to minimize the magnitude of pediatrics Shigellosis.",

The study covered two forms of human milk fortifier, liquid and powdered, with or without probiotics and storage at 4  degrees C for 24 h. To test the adhesion properties of the probiotic strains, DHM+probiotics and FDHM+probiotics were prepared and added to immobilized mucus isolated from the stool of healthy Finnish infants. The probiotic adhesion was then measured by liquid scintillation. Our results suggest that addition of liquid or powdered human milk fortifier in donor human milk had no impact on probiotic adhesion. In addition, given the increased adhesion of probiotics suspended in buffer, other matrices should be further studied. These factors need to be considered when designing future intervention strategies using probiotics in preterm infants.",

AIMS: To study if different thickness levels of MSAF correlate with adverse neonatal outcome. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: The medical records and neonatal charts of all women with a singleton pregnancy, who underwent a trial of labor, at 37 + 0/7 weeks or beyond, between 10/2008 and 7/2018 were reviewed. OUTCOME MEASURES: The cohort was divided according to the level of meconium reported during labor into four groups: Clear (C group), Light meconium (LM group), Intermediate meconium (IM group), and Heavy meconium (HM group). Composite neonatal outcome included at least one of the following: umbilical artery pH </= 7.1, sepsis, need for blood transfusion, need for phototherapy, respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation support, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, periventricular leukomalacia, seizures, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and death. Continuous parameters were compared with Anova's test or Kruskal Wallis, and categorical variables by chi-square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Multivariant logistic regression was performed in order to eliminate possible cofounders. RESULTS: Overall, 24,445 deliveries were reviewed (C-20,185, LM-1074, IM-2736, HM-450). Composite adverse neonatal outcome was more common with increasing thickness of MSAF. On multivariable analysis, IM and HM were independently associated with composite adverse neonatal outcome.

The significance of toxin-producing C. difficile in children with diarrhea is unclear and practice differs on whether to institute treatment. We aimed to characterize the microbiome in relation to the presence of C. difficile and co-infection with other pathogens and to describe host response to infection. METHODS: Participants were children with acute diarrhea, 0-16 years of age, from whom stool samples had been submitted to the hospital laboratory for routine microbiology/virology. Convenience sampling was used for 50 prospective and 150 retrospective samples. No participants were treated for C. difficile. Rates of culture positivity for C. difficile, presence of toxin and PCR-ribotype were compared between age groups. Presence of other potential pathogens, comorbidities and complications were recorded. Microbiotal diversity was measured by 16S profiling. RESULTS: Nineteen of 77 (25%) children <2 years of age and 13 of 119 (11%) children >2 years of age were C. difficile positive, of whom 10 (53%) and 9 (69%), respectively, carried toxigenic strains. Increased Shannon diversity was seen in children carrying C. difficile, with altered milieu. Presence of C. difficile was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes. In stools containing both Norovirus and C. difficile, there was increased relative abundance of verrucomicrobia. CONCLUSIONS: Children with diarrhea regularly carried toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains of C. difficile, demonstrating enhanced microbiotal diversity, and change in milieu, without apparent morbidity.

STEC are confined to the gut resulting in hemorrhagic colitis, whereas Stx are delivered in blood to target kidney and brain, with unclear mechanisms, triggering HUS in 5 to 15% of infected children. Stx were found on circulating cells, free in sera (soluble Stx) or in blood cell-derived microvesicles (particulate Stx), whereby the relationship between these forms of circulating toxins is unclear. Here, we have examined 2,846 children with bloody diarrhea and found evidence of STEC infection in 5%. Twenty patients were enrolled to study the natural course of STEC infections before the onset of HUS. In patients, Stx were found to be associated to circulating cells and/or free and functionally active in sera. In most children, Stx were bound to neutrophils when high amounts of toxins were found in feces. Time-course analysis showed that Stx increased transiently in patients' sera while the decrease of toxin amount on leukocytes was observed. Notably, patients who recovered (85%) displayed different settings than those who developed HUS (15%). The distinctive feature of the latter group was the presence in blood of particulate Stx2 (Stx2 sedimented at g-forces corresponding to 1 mum microvesicles) the day before diagnosis of HUS, during the release phase of toxins from circulating cells. This observation strongly suggests the involvement of blood cell-derived particulate Stx2 in the transition from hemorrhagic colitis to HUS.",

Earlier maternal nutritional habits were more strongly associated with the offspring microbiota (maternal oligosaccharide positively with infant Ruminococcus, maternal saturated fat intake inversely with infant Rikenellaceae and Ruminococcus) than last-trimester maternal habits. Principal coordinate analysis showed a separation of the infant microbiota according to the type of feeding (breastfeeding vs formula-feeding), displaying in breast-fed infants a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium. A few Bacteroides and Blautia oligotypes were shared by the GDM mothers and their offspring, suggesting a maternal microbial imprinting.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The earliest microbial colonizers of the human gut can have life-long consequences for their hosts. Precisely how the neonatal gut bacterial microbiome and virome are initially populated is not well understood. To better understand how the maternal gut microbiome influences acquisition of the infant gut microbiome, we studied the early life bacterial microbiomes and viromes of 28 infant twin pairs and their mothers. RESULTS: Infant bacterial and viral communities more closely resemble those of their related co-twin than unrelated infants. We found that 63% of an infant's bacterial microbiome can be traced to their mother's gut microbiota. In contrast, only 15% of their viral communities are acquired from their mother. Delivery route did not determine how much of the bacterial microbiome or virome was shared from mother to infant. However, bacteria-bacteriophage interactions were altered by delivery route. CONCLUSIONS: The maternal gut microbiome significantly influences infant gut microbiome acquisition. Vertical transmission of the bacterial microbiome is substantially higher compared to vertical transmission of the virome. However, the degree of similarity between the maternal and infant gut bacterial microbiome and virome did not vary by delivery route. The greater similarity of the bacterial microbiome and virome between twin pairs than unrelated twins may reflect a shared environmental exposure. Thus, differences of the inter-generation transmissibility at birth between the major kingdoms of microbes indicate that the foundation of these microbial communities are shaped by different rules.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microbial exposures in utero and early life shape the infant microbiome, which can profoundly impact on health. Compared to the bacterial microbiome, very little is known about the virome. We set out to characterize longitudinal changes in the gut virome of healthy infants born to mothers with or without type 1 diabetes using comprehensive virome capture sequencing. METHODS: Healthy infants were selected from Environmental Determinants of Islet Autoimmunity (ENDIA), a prospective cohort of Australian children with a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes, followed from pregnancy. Fecal specimens were collected three-monthly in the first year of life. RESULTS: Among 25 infants (44% born to mothers with type 1 diabetes) at least one virus was detected in 65% (65/100) of samples and 96% (24/25) of infants during the first year of life. In total, 26 genera of viruses were identified and >150 viruses were differentially abundant between the gut of infants with a mother with type 1 diabetes vs without. Positivity for any virus was associated with maternal type 1 diabetes and older infant age. Enterovirus was associated with older infant age and maternal smoking. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a distinct gut virome profile in infants of mothers with type 1 diabetes, which may influence health outcomes later in life. Higher prevalence and greater number of viruses observed compared to previous studies suggests significant underrepresentation in existing virome datasets, arising most likely from less sensitive techniques used in data acquisition.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is a major global public health threat. Antibiotic use can directly impact the antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) profile of the human intestinal microbiome and consequently the environment through shedding. METHODS: We determined the resistome of human feces, animal stools, human food and environmental (rain, well, and irrigative water) samples (n = 304) in 40 households within a community cohort and related the data to antibiotic consumption. Metagenomic DNA was isolated and qPCR was used to determine presence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), carbapenemases and quinolone resistance genes. RESULTS: Nearly 40 % (39.5%, 120/304) of samples contained ESBL genes (most frequent were CTX-M-9 (23.7% [72/304]), CTX-M-1 (18.8% [57/304]). Quinolone resistance genes (qnrS) were detected in all human and 91% (41/45) of animal stool samples. Mcr-1 and mcr-3 were predominantly detected in human feces at 88% (82/93) and 55% (51/93) and animal feces at 93% (42/45) and 51% (23/45), respectively. Mcr-2, mrc-4 and mcr-5 were not detected in human feces, and only sporadically (< 6%) in other samples. Carbapenemase-encoding genes were most common in water (15% [14/91]) and cooked food (13% [10/75]) samples, while their prevalence in human and animal stools was lower at 4% in both human (4/93) and animal (2/45) samples. We did not find an association between recent antibiotic consumption and ARGs in human stools. Principal component analysis showed that the resistome differs between ecosystems with a strong separation of ARGs profiles of human and animal stools on the one hand versus cooked food and water samples on the other. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that ARGs were abundant in human and animal stools in a rural Vietnamese community, including ARGs targeting last resort antibiotics. The resistomes of animal and human stools were similar as opposed to the resistomes from water and food sources. No association between antibiotic use and ARG profiles was found in a setting of high background rates of AMR.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the last century, meconium peritonitis(MP)was once a highly fatal gastrointestinal. disease With the development of fetal radiological technology, abnormal signs, such as pseudocysts, can. be detected during the fetal period so that more patients can be diagnosed prenatally and receive surgery. in the early stage of life. The survival rate of MP has increased up to 80% in recent years. According to. a review of the treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed with MP, we evaluated the influence of. early operation on survival rate and discussed the risk factors of prognosis. METHODS: We collected 79 cases of patients diagnosed with MP who were treated in our department. from October 2001 to December 2017. They were divided into 2 groups. Patients in group A were born. in our hospital. Patients in group B were born in a local hospital with suspicion of MP and then transferred. to our department. RESULTS: The birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) of patients were higher in group A than in. group B. There was no significant difference in the proportion of premature and low birth weight (LBW). patients between the two groups (p = 0.422, p = 0.970). Their age at the time of surgery was younger in. group A than in group B (1.4 +/- 2.0 vs. 6.9 +/- 14.9, p < 0.001). The overall survival rate of group A was higher. than that of group B (95.0% vs. 79.5%, p = 0.038). The prognosis of premature patients was worse than. that of full-term infants for both groups (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Prematurity is a significant risk factor related to death for MP patients. The survival rate. of MP patients can be improved by early operation during the neonatal period.",

			"abstract": "Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria to compete with other bacteria for nutrients and ecological niches. The antimicrobial effect of these peptides on the bacterial populations in the gut is likely dynamic as the survival of the microbes in this environment depends on both competition and cooperation. In this study, we evaluated four different bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (LAB): nisin, enterocin A (EntA), enterocin K1 (EntK1), and garvicin ML (GarML), which have different inhibition spectra and physicochemical properties. The bacteriocins were tested in vitro using fecal slurry batch cultures from infants. The abundances of some bacterial populations in the cultures were determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the metabolic activity of the gut microbiota was assessed by measuring the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) using gas chromatography. The effects of the bacteriocins correlated well with their antimicrobial spectra and the administered concentrations. Nisin and GarML, with broad antimicrobial spectra, shifted the abundance of several intestinal bacterial groups, while EntA and EntK1, with relative narrower inhibition spectra, showed no or little effect. Moreover, the results from the SCFA analysis were consistent with changes obtained in the bacterial composition. In particular, a reduction in acetate concentration was observed in the samples with low abundance of Bifidobacterium, which is a well-known acetate producer. The variability imposed on the intestinal bacterial populations by the different bacteriocins tested suggests that this type of antimicrobials have great potential to modulate the gut microbiota for medical purposes.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: This pilot study was conducted to determine if we could identify intrauterine exposure to metals in meconium, as a measure of exposure for mother-child pairs living in proximity to a mining operation. OBJECTIVES: We used meconium as a means to measure metal exposure in utero. We set out to quantify the exposure to selected metals that are currently being mined and also are found in the Superfund site in Butte, Montana, and to compare it to that of Columbia, South Carolina, US, where mining is not occurring. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between May and November 2018. We received Institutional Review Board approval and we consented women following the birth of their newborns, and collected meconium within 24 h of birth, without any identifiers. Each laboratory used the same protocol for collection, transport, and storage; and the same laboratory protocol was used for the analysis of all samples. Samples were digested using standard acid/peroxide digestion methods and measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. RESULTS: We collected meconium specimens from 17 infants in Columbia, South Carolina and 15 infants in Butte, Montana. The concentrations found in Columbia were in the low mug kg(-1) range (or less) and were similar to the low levels that have been identified in other studies of meconium. The magnitude of the differences in concentrations found in Butte compared to Columbia was 1792 times higher for Cu, 1650 times higher for Mn, and 1883 times higher for Zn. CONCLUSION: Using meconium to measure exposure of newborns has implications for risk assessment in a mining-exposed population. This approach was inexpensive and thorough. The magnitude of the differences in the metal levels identified from the two study sites suggests there is an urgent need for further research to learn if there are health consequences to these highly exposed infants.",

			"article_name": "Diarrhea as a Potential Cause and Consequence of Reduced Gut Microbial Diversity Among Undernourished Children in Peru.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Detrimental effects of diarrhea on child growth and survival are well documented, but details of the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent evidence demonstrates that perturbations to normal development of the gut microbiota in early life may contribute to growth faltering and susceptibility to related childhood diseases. We assessed associations between diarrhea, gut microbiota configuration, and childhood growth in the Peruvian Amazon. METHODS: Growth, diarrhea incidence, illness, pathogen infection, and antibiotic exposure were assessed monthly in a birth cohort of 271 children aged 0-24 months. Gut bacterial diversity and abundances of specific bacterial taxa were quantified by sequencing 16S rRNA genes in fecal samples collected at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Linear and generalized linear models were used to determine whether diarrhea was associated with altered microbiota and, in turn, if features of the microbiota were associated with the subsequent risk of diarrhea. RESULTS: Diarrheal frequency, duration, and severity were negatively associated with bacterial diversity and richness (P < .05). Children born stunted (length-for-age z-score [LAZ] </= -2) who were also severely stunted (LAZ </= -3) at the time of sampling exhibited the greatest degree of diarrhea-associated reductions in bacterial diversity and the slowest recovery of bacterial diversity after episodes of diarrhea. Increased bacterial diversity was predictive of reduced subsequent diarrhea from age 6 to 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent, severe growth faltering may reduce the gut microbiota's resistance and resilience to diarrhea, leading to greater losses of diversity and longer recovery times. This phenotype, in turn, denotes an increased risk of future diarrheal disease and growth faltering.",

P[6]-based rotavirus vaccines could broaden protection in such settings, particularly in Africa, where the Lewis-negative phenotype and P[6] rotavirus strains are common. METHODS: The association between HBGA status and G3P[6] rotavirus vaccine (RV3-BB) take was investigated in a phase 2A study of RV3-BB vaccine involving 46 individuals in Dunedin, New Zealand, during 2012-2014. FUT2 and FUT3 genotypes were determined from DNA extracted from stool specimens, and frequencies of positive cumulative vaccine take, defined as an RV3-BB serum immune response (either immunoglobulin A or serum neutralizing antibody) and/or stool excretion of the vaccine strain, stratified by HBGA status were determined. RESULTS: RV3-BB produced positive cumulative vaccine take in 29 of 32 individuals (91%) who expressed a functional FUT2 enzyme (the secretor group), 13 of 13 (100%) who were FUT2 null (the nonsecretor group), and 1 of 1 with reduced FUT2 activity (i.e., a weak secretor); in 37 of 40 individuals (93%) who expressed a functional FUT3 enzyme (the Lewis-positive group) and 3 of 3 who were FUT3 null (the Lewis-negative group); and in 25 of 28 Lewis-positive secretors (89%), 12 of 12 Lewis-positive nonsecretors (100%), 2 of 2 Lewis-negative secretors, and 1 of 1 Lewis-negative weak secretor. CONCLUSIONS: RV3-BB produced positive cumulative vaccine take irrespective of HBGA status. RV3-BB has the potential to provide an improved level of protection in settings where P[6] rotavirus disease is endemic, irrespective of the HBGA profile of the population.",

Despite their global prevalence, no data is available on the epidemiology of HBoV associated with AGE in South Africa (SA). Between April 2009 and April 2015, 3765 stool specimens were collected from children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with diarrhea. Specimens were screened for selected enteric viruses by enzyme immunoassay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, bacteria by culture and parasites by staining and microscopy. HBoV was detected in 5.63% (212 of 3765) of cases, the majority of which were children </=2 years (92%, 195 of 212), and were common in the summer and autumn months (60%; 128 of 212). Further investigations of coinfections showed that bacteria (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-3.45; P = .001) and sapovirus (aOR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.08-3.86; P = .027) were significantly associated with HBoV in multivariate analysis. HBoV genotyping was successful in 191 of the 212 samples with HBoV-1 being the most prevalent genotype observed (79.6%; 152 of 191) followed by HBoV-3 (13.6%; 26 of 191), HBoV-2 (5.2%; 10 of 191), and HBoV-4 (1.6%; 3 of 191). The high prevalence of HBoV-1, a virus known to be associated with respiratory infections, and the association between HBoV-positive specimens and already established AGE agents, suggests that HBoV may play a limited role in the observed AGE cases in SA.",

Adenovirus has been associated with intussusception and slightly increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccination has been found. We conducted a case-control study among children <2 years old in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Vietnam to evaluate infectious etiologies of intussusception before rotavirus vaccine introduction. METHODS: From 2015 to 2017, we enrolled 1-to-1 matched intussusception cases and hospital controls; 249 pairs were included. Stool specimens were tested for 37 infectious agents using TaqMan Array technology. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each pathogen associated with intussusception in a pooled analysis and quantitative subanalyses. RESULTS: Adenovirus (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.75-4.36) and human herpes virus 6 (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.15-10.63) were detected more frequently in cases than controls. Adenovirus C detection <20 quantification cycles was associated with intussusception (OR, 18.59; 95% CI, 2.45-140.89). Wild-type rotavirus was not associated with intussusception (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.52-2.22). CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive evaluation, adenovirus and HHV-6 were associated with intussusception.

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Findings from animal studies indicate that the early gut bacteriome is a potential mechanism linking maternal prenatal stress with health trajectories in offspring. However, clinical studies are scarce and the associations of maternal psychological profiles with the early infant faecal bacteriome are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the associations of prenatal stressors and distress with early infant faecal bacterial profiles in a South African birth cohort study. METHODS: Associations between prenatal symptoms of depression, distress, intimate partner violence (IPV) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and faecal bacterial profiles were evaluated in meconium and subsequent stool specimens from 84 mothers and 101 infants at birth, and longitudinally from a subset of 69 and 36 infants at 4-12 and 20-28 weeks of age, respectively, in a South African birth cohort study. RESULTS: Infants born to mothers that were exposed to high levels of IPV had significantly higher proportions of Citrobacter and three unclassified genera, all of which belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae detected at birth. Proportions of these Enterobacteriaceae remained significantly increased over time (birth to 20-28 weeks of life) in infants born to mothers with high levels of IPV exposure compared to infants from mothers with no/low IPV exposure. Infants born to mothers exposed to IPV also had higher proportions of the genus Weissella at 4-12 weeks compared to infants from mothers with no/low IPV exposure. Faecal specimens from mothers exposed to IPV had higher proportions of the family Lactobacillaceae and lower proportions of Peptostreptococcaceae at birth. Maternal psychological distress was associated with decreased proportions of the family Veillonellaceae in infants at 20-28 weeks and a slower decline in Gammaproteobacteria over time. No changes in beta diversity were apparent for maternal or infant faecal bacterial profiles in relation to any of the prenatal measures for psychological adversities. CONCLUSION: Maternal lifetime IPV and antenatal psychological distress are associated with altered bacterial profiles in infant and maternal faecal bacteria. These findings may provide insights in the involvement of the gut bacteria linking maternal psychological adversity and the maturing infant brain.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral rotavirus vaccines (RVVs) are less efficacious in low-income versus high-income settings, plausibly due to more enteropathogen exposure through poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We explored associations between enteropathogens and RVV immunogenicity and evaluated the effect of improved WASH on enteropathogen carriage. METHODS: We detected stool enteropathogens using quantitative molecular methods and measured anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in infants enrolled to a cluster randomized 2 x 2 factorial trial of improved WASH and improved infant feeding in Zimbabwe (NCT01824940). We used multivariable regression to explore associations between enteropathogens and RVV seroconversion, seropositivity and geometric mean titer. We evaluated effects of improved WASH on enteropathogen prevalence using linear and binomial regression models with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Among 224 infants with enteropathogen and immunogenicity data, 107 (47.8%) had >/=1 pathogen and 39 (17.4%) had >/=2 pathogens detected at median age 41 days (interquartile range: 35-54). RVV seroconversion was low (23.7%). After adjusting for Sabin-poliovirus quantity, pan-enterovirus quantity was positively associated with RVV seroconversion (relative risk 1.61 per 10-fold increase in pan-enterovirus; 95% confidence interval: 1.35-1.91); in the same model, Sabin quantity was negatively associated with RVV seroconversion (relative risk: 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.96). There were otherwise no meaningful associations between individual or total pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites or all pathogens) and any measure of RVV immunogenicity. Enteropathogen detection did not differ between randomized WASH and non-WASH groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enteropathogen infections were common around the time of rotavirus vaccination in rural Zimbabwean infants but did not explain poor RVV immunogenicity and were not reduced by a package of household-level WASH interventions.",

There exists little data, however, detailing longitudinal microbial acquisition, especially in the most extremely preterm (<26 weeks' gestation). This study aims to characterize the development of the microbiota in this previously under-represented cohort. METHODS: Seven extremely preterm infant-mother dyads (mean gestation 23.6 weeks) were recruited from a single neonatal intensive care unit. Oral and endotracheal secretions, stool, and breast milk (n = 157 total), were collected over the first 60 days of life. Targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified bacterial communities present. RESULTS: Microbiota of all body sites were most similar immediately following birth and diverged longitudinally. Throughout the sampling period Escherichia, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and an Enterobacteriaceae were dominant and well dispersed across all sites. Temporal divergence of the stool from other microbiota was driven by decreasing diversity and significantly greater proportional abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae compared to other sites. CONCLUSIONS: Four taxa dominated all anatomical sampling sites. Rare taxa promoted dissimilarity. Cross-seeding between upstream communities and the stool was demonstrated, possibly relating to buccal colostrum/breast milk exposure and indwelling tubes. Given the importance of dysbiosis in health and disease of extremely preterm infants, better understanding of microbial acquisition within this context may be of clinical benefit.",

METHODS: We evaluated the association between prenatal ultrasound features, maternal characteristics, and the likelihood of surgery, mortality, and serious morbidity in 49 neonates with a prenatal diagnosis of MP, who were born in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center between January 2011 and December 2016. RESULTS: Thirty of 49 neonates (61.2%) required surgical treatment, and 17 (34.7%) had a poor outcome. Independent predictors of need for surgical treatment were polyhydramnios, maternal intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (associated with lower risk), and persistence of peritoneal fluid. The model correctly predicted 70.0% of the neonates who required surgery (at a 10% false-positive rate; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]). For poor outcomes, independent predictors were low gestational age at birth, persistence of peritoneal fluid, and polyhydramnios. For the latter, the model only achieved a detection rate of 52.9% (10% false-positive rate, AUC: 0.82 [95% CI, 0.70-0.94]).

			"abstract": "Breast-feeding is the ideal nutrition for a newborn's integral necessities. It seems crucial therefore to know its composition in order to provide suitable infant formula when required. Of these, polyamines (with lactation and the microbiota being its intestinal source) are involved in the development of gut epithelium and immunity. Safety concerns limit human intervention studies. Therefore, we studied the amounts of polyamines supplied by breast milk (varying among mothers) or infant formula feeding, up to day 30 postpartum, in the faeces of newborns. Independent samples (68) of breast milk from fifty-nine healthy Caucasian woman (day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 15 and 30 postpartum) who had natural deliveries after week 38, same-day faeces of newborns when available (eighty-one from breast milk and fifty-five from infant formula fed) and six infant formulas were collected and the polyamine content was determined by HPLC. In breast milk, polyamines and isoamylamine (a primary amine), with inter-individual variations, increased over time (with a higher content of spermidine; no other amines were present). Overall, they were much higher than in infant formula. By the 2nd week after birth, polyamines, cadaverine and tyramine, but not isoamylamine, were higher in the faeces of those fed infant formula compared with those fed breast milk. Cadaverine and tyramine could be used to predict the feeding type used for newborns. The differences in the content may be related to distinct colonisation of amine-producing bacteria, which can be established by polyamines. Further studies are required to determine the clinical utility of these findings.",

			"article_name": "Association of Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase With Necrotizing Enterocolitis Among Premature Infants.",
			"abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants is an often-fatal gastrointestinal tract emergency. A robust NEC biomarker that is not confounded by sepsis could improve bedside management, lead to lower morbidity and mortality, and permit patient selection in randomized clinical trials of possible therapeutic approaches. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether aberrant intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) biochemistry in infant stool is a molecular biomarker for NEC and not associated with sepsis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter diagnostic study enrolled 136 premature infants (gestational age, <37 weeks) in 2 hospitals in Louisiana and 1 hospital in Missouri. Data were collected and analyzed from May 2015 to November 2018. EXPOSURES: Infant stool samples were collected between 24 and 40 or more weeks postconceptual age. Enrolled infants underwent abdominal radiography at physician and hospital site discretion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Enzyme activity and relative abundance of IAP were measured using fluorometric detection and immunoassays, respectively. After measurements were performed, biochemical data were evaluated against clinical entries from infants' hospital stay. RESULTS: Of 136 infants, 68 (50.0%) were male infants, median (interquartile range [IQR]) birth weight was 1050 (790-1350) g, and median (IQR) gestational age was 28.4 (26.0-30.9) weeks. A total of 25 infants (18.4%) were diagnosed with severe NEC, 19 (14.0%) were suspected of having NEC, and 92 (66.9%) did not have NEC; 26 patients (19.1%) were diagnosed with late-onset sepsis, and 14 (10.3%) had other non-gastrointestinal tract infections. For severe NEC, suspected NEC, and no NEC samples, median (IQR) fecal IAP content, relative to the amount of IAP in human small intestinal lysate, was 99.0% (51.0%-187.8%) (95% CI, 54.0%-163.0%), 123.0% (31.0%-224.0%) (95% CI, 31.0%-224.0%), and 4.8% (2.4%-9.8%) (95% CI, 3.4%-5.9%), respectively. For severe NEC, suspected NEC, and no NEC samples, median (IQR) enzyme activity was 183 (56-507) mumol/min/g (95% CI, 63-478 mumol/min/g) of stool protein, 355 (172-608) mumol/min/g (95% CI, 172-608 mumol/min/g) of stool protein, and 613 (210-1465) mumol/min/g (95% CI, 386-723 mumol/min/g) of stool protein, respectively. Mean (SE) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for IAP content measurements were 0.97 (0.02) (95% CI, 0.93-1.00; P < .001) at time of severe NEC, 0.97 (0.02) (95% CI, 0.93-1.00; P < .001) at time of suspected NEC, 0.52 (0.07) (95% CI, 0.38-0.66; P = .75) at time of sepsis, and 0.58 (0.08) (95% CI, 0.42-0.75; P = .06) at time of other non-gastrointestinal tract infections. Mean (SE) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for IAP activity were 0.76 (0.06) (95% CI, 0.64-0.86; P < .001), 0.62 (0.07) (95% CI, 0.48-0.77; P = .13), 0.52 (0.07) (95% CI, 0.39-0.67; P = .68), and 0.57 (0.08) (95% CI, 0.39-0.69; P = .66), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, high amounts of IAP protein in stool and low IAP enzyme activity were associated with diagnosis of NEC and may serve as useful biomarkers for NEC. Our findings indicated that IAP biochemistry was uniquely able to distinguish NEC from sepsis.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mothers are the primary source of bacteria for newborns, but it is unclear whether mother-to-newborn transmission occurs prior to, during or after birth. Similarly, the effect of the delivery mode on neonatal microorganisms has been the focus of controversy. METHODS: Healthy maternal and neonatal pairs that underwent vaginal birth and caesarean section were enrolled in this study. Meconium, placenta, membrane and amniotic fluid samples for newborns and vaginal, rectal and oral samples for mothers were collected. All samples were amplified and sequenced by a 16S rRNA gene primer set targeting bacteria and archaea. FINDINGS: A total of 550 samples from 36 mother-neonate pairs with vaginal births and 42 mother-neonate pairs with caesarean sections were included in this study. The negative controls showed that the data analysis in this study was not affected by contamination. There was a high diversity of microbial communities in the pregnancy environment of the foetus. Meconium samples could be divided into three distinct types that were not influenced by the delivery method. INTERPRETATION: The distribution patterns of bacterial communities in the meconium, placenta, and foetal membranes were highly similar and had nothing to do with the mode of delivery. For approximately half of the placental microorganisms, the same sequence could be found in the vaginal, rectal, and oral samples of the mother.",

			"abstract": "The early-life microbiome appears to be affected by mode of delivery, but this effect may depend on intrapartum antibiotic exposure. Here, we assess the effect of delivery mode on gut microbiota, independent of intrapartum antibiotics, by postponing routine antibiotic administration to mothers until after cord clamping in 74 vaginally delivered and 46 caesarean section born infants. The microbiota differs between caesarean section born and vaginally delivered infants over the first year of life, showing enrichment of Bifidobacterium spp., and reduction of Enterococcus and Klebsiella spp. in vaginally delivered infants. The microbiota composition at one week of life is associated with the number of respiratory infections over the first year. The taxa driving this association are more abundant in caesarean section born children, providing a possible link between mode of delivery and susceptibility to infectious outcomes.",

To investigate the effects of aging on the gut microbiota independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut microbiome was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut microbiome. Consistent with previous studies on the human gut microbiome, beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut microbiome-age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the microbiome.",

In the current study, we isolated a novel strain of Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense, named APCKJ1, from the faeces of a four-week old breastfed infant, based on the ability of the strain to utilise the HMO component fucosyllactose. We then determined the full genome sequence of this strain, and employed the generated data to analyze fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Transcriptomic and growth analyses, combined with metabolite analysis, in vitro hydrolysis assays and heterologous expression, allowed us to elucidate the pathway for fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Homologs of the key genes for this metabolic pathway were identified in particular in infant-derived members of the Bifdobacterium genus, revealing the apparent niche-specific nature of this pathway, and allowing a broad perspective on bifidobacterial fucosyllactose and L-fucose metabolism.",

			"article_name": "Mercury speciation in meconium and associated factors.",
			"abstract": "Meconium is formed early in gestation and it is normally not excreted until after birth. Thus it may provide a longer and cumulative record of exposure to mercury (Hg). The present study aims to speciate Hg in meconium samples (N\u202f=\u202f488) from Slovenian and Croatian new-borns prenatally exposed to low levels of methyl-Hg (MeHg) from maternal seafood intake and to Hg(0) from maternal dental amalgam fillings. We had complete data of total Hg (THg) and MeHg in meconium and THg in maternal hair (MH), while THg and MeHg in maternal blood (MB) were available only for Croatian mothers. Personal data namely maternal seafood intake, age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, smoking, estimated gestational age at birth, sex, and birth weight were available for the majority of participants, except the number of dental amalgams which was in most cases missing for Croatian mothers. The median THg concentration in meconium was 11.1 (range: 0.41-375.2) ng/g and inorganic Hg (Hg(II)) presented 98.8% (range: 82%-100%, CV: 2%) of THg. We observed significant correlation between meconium and MH Hg levels, with the highest correlation between hair THg and meconium MeHg. Correlation analysis including MB (available only for Croatian population) showed a significant positive correlation between THg in meconium and THg in MB (R(s)\u202f=\u202f0.642). Additionally, MeHg from MB was correlated with MeHg in meconium (R(s)\u202f=\u202f0.898), while the correlation between Hg(II) in MB and meconium was positive, but not significant. Maternal seafood intake was significantly correlated with meconium MeHg (R(s)\u202f=\u202f0.498) and Hg(II) (R(s)\u202f=\u202f0.201). Multiple linear regression (performed on the Slovenian population, N\u202f=\u202f143) confirmed a positive association between meconium MeHg and seafood intake. Furthermore, meconium Hg(II) was positively associated with the number of maternal dental amalgam fillings, but linear regression models did not confirm correlation between seafood intake and meconium Hg(II) levels. We assume that Hg(0) released from maternal dental amalgam fillings and MeHg from seafood intake were both transported through the placental barrier and portioned between different foetal compartments including meconium. Weak correlation between maternal seafood intake and Hg(II) levels in meconium suggests that there is certain evidence of MeHg demethylation. However, because this correlation was not confirmed by the multiple regression, MeHg demethylation during prenatal life cannot be neither confirmed nor excluded. Further investigations at higher level of exposure are needed to confirm this observations. We can conclude that meconium is a suitable biomarker for MeHg and Hg(0) exposure during pregnancy. However, comparability of the results reported in meconium in different studies is hindered by a lack of standardized sampling protocols, storage, and analysis.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Based on the impact public health of norovirus and the current progress in norovirus vaccine development, it is necessary to continuously monitor the epidemiology of norovirus infection, especially in children who are more susceptible to norovirus. OBJECTIVES: To monitor the activity and genotypes of norovirus infection in sporadic diarrhea in Shanghainese children during 2014-2018. STUDY DESIGN: Acute diarrheal cases were prospectively enrolled in the outpatient setting. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used for screening norovirus GI and GII genogroups. Dual norovirus genotypes were identified based on the partial capsid and polymerase gene sequences. RESULTS: Of the 3422 children with diarrhea, 510 (14.9%) were positive for noroviruses with 13 (2.5%) strains being GI genogroup and 497 (97.5%) strains being GII genogroup. Five distinct capsid GII genotypes were identified, including GII.4-Sydney/2012 (71.8%), GII.3 (13.8%), GII.17 (7.8%), GII.2 (6.0%), GII.6 (0.3%) and GII.8 (0.3%). Seven polymerase GII genotypes were identified, including GII.Pe (77.0%), GII.P12 (11.0%), GII.P17 (9.0%), GII.P16 (2.1%), and GII.P7, GII.P8 and GII.P2 in each (0.3%). Eleven distinct polymerase/capsid genotypes were identified with GII.Pe/GII.4-Sydney/2012 (74.2%), GII.P12/GII.3 (11.7%) and GII.P17/GII.17 (7.7%) being common. GII.P17/GII.17 strains were detected since September 2014. Recombinant GII.P16/GII.2 strains were detected since December 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Norovirus is a major pathogen causing diarrhea in Shanghainese children. GII.Pe/GII.4-Sydney/2012 strains remained the predominant genotype. The emergence of GII.P17/GII.17 and GII.P16/GII.2 strains in sporadic diarrhea was consistent with norovirus-associated outbreaks attributable to these 2 novel variants in China. Continuous monitoring norovirus genotypes circulating in pediatric population is needed for current vaccine development.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Helminthic and protozoan infections are common, particularly in low- or middle-income countries. Although an association between parasite carriage and markers of poor growth have been shown in some studies, systematic reviews have suggested only a modest impact of clearing carriage. The prevalence of these pathogens and the effect that they have on growth in preschool children has never been investigated in Malawi. METHODS: One hundred ninety-three children aged 0-72 months were randomly recruited from rural villages in the Mangochi district of Malawi. Formol-ether concentration was performed on stool and the samples examined with a light microscope. Anthropometric data was taken for each child and the haemoglobin measured with a point of care test. RESULTS: The mean age of the children was 2 years 4 months. Overall prevalence of intestinal parasite infection was 37.3%. Protozoa were found in 28.5% of children, while helminths were found in 8.8%. The most commonly found organisms were Giardia lambia (12.4%), Entamoeba coli (10.4%) and Hookworm species (3.6%). Stunting was seen in 47.8% of children, 12.9% were underweight and 5.0% were wasted. No significant association was found between markers of poor growth and infection with any intestinal parasite. CONCLUSIONS: We found that prevalence of helminth infection was low in preschool children living in the Mangochi district compared to international standards. However a significant proportion of the preschool population are infected with protozoa, particularly Giardia lambia. In this cohort, despite a significant prevalence of stunting, helminth infection was not significantly associated with any markers of poor growth. The significance of protozoal carriage and contribution to growth restriction in this context creates further avenues for future research.",

METHODS: Diet was assessed using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire, faecal microbiota profile was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, in a cohort of 50 infants aged 6 to 24 months of age. RESULTS: During this critical period of microbiota development, age was the strongest predictor of microbiota composition with network analysis revealing a cluster of genera positively associated with age. A separate cluster comprised genera associated with fat mass index with Bifidobacterium showing the strongest correlation with fat mass index (rho = 0.55, P = 0.001, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.018). Dairy intake was both negatively correlated with Bacteroides (rho = -0.49, P < 0.001, FDR = 0.024) and positively correlated with lean mass index (rho = 0.44, P = 0.007, FDR = 0.024). Antibiotics use in the first month of life had the most striking influence on body composition and was associated with an increase in mean body mass index z score of 1.17 (P = 0.001) and body fat of 3.5% (P = 0.001).

However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants. The BA profiles were classified into four types, defined by high content of conjugated primary BA (Con type), unconjugated primary BA (chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid) (Pri type), ursodeoxycholic acid (Urs type), and deoxycholic and lithocholic acid (Sec type). Most subjects begun with Con type or Pri type profiles during lactation and eventually transited to Sec type through Urs type after the start of solid food intake. Con type and Pri type were associated with Enterobacteriaceae-dominant microbiota corresponding to the neonatal type or Bifidobacterium-dominant microbiota corresponding to lactation type, respectively. Urs type subjects were strongly associated with Ruminococcus gnavus colonization, mostly occurring between Pri type and Sec type. Sec type was associated with adult-type complex microbiota dominated by a variety of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes species.

RESULTS: Prior to vaccine introduction, the predominant rotavirus circulating genotypes were G9P[8] (n\u202f=\u202f63, 60%) and G1P[8] (n\u202f=\u202f22, 21%). During the vaccine period, G2P[4] was the predominant genotype (n\u202f=\u202f49, 28%), followed by G9P[8] (n\u202f=\u202f40, 22%) and G1P[8] (n\u202f=\u202f33, 18.5%). There was a significant decline in the prevalence of G9P[8] (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) in the post-vaccination period. There was also a notable decline in G1P[8]. A spike in G2P[4] was observed in 2013, one year post-vaccine introduction. Rotavirus strain G3P[4] (n\u202f=\u202f8) was only detected in the post-vaccine introduction period. In 2018 there was a marked increase in genotype G3P[8] (p\u202f=\u202f0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of circulating rotavirus genotypes in Botswana changed after vaccine implementation. Further studies are needed to examine whether these changes are related to vaccination or simply represent natural secular variation.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Rotavirus is the major cause of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. In countries like Croatia, where rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced in the national immunization program, prospective surveillance is necessary to establish the diversity of rotavirus strains. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and geographical distribution of rotavirus strains in Croatia and to detect the possible emergence of novel strains. METHODS: The study was conducted among children </=5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis at three hospitals located in different geographical regions of Croatia, during the years 2012 to 2014. Rotavirus was detected in stools using an immunochromatographic assay and then sent for further molecular analysis. RESULTS: Genotyping of 822 rotaviruses showed that the predominant circulating strain was G1P[8] (61.9%), followed by G2P[4] (19.5%), G1P[4] (3.9%), and G3P[8] (2.9%). A high prevalence of reassortants among common human rotavirus genotypes was detected (7.7%). Possible zoonotic reassortants were found, including G8 and G6 strains. The latter is described for the first time in Croatia. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents pre-vaccination data that are important for decisions regarding immunization strategies in Croatia. The high prevalence of 'common' rotavirus strains circulating in Croatia may advocate for rotavirus vaccine introduction, but further surveillance is necessary to monitor the possible emergence of novel genotypes.",

			"abstract": "The gut microbiota harbor a wide range of bacterial species, but also yeasts may be part of this ecosystem. Infants who are being treated in intensive care units are often colonized by Candida species. However, little is known regarding commensal yeast colonization of healthy infants and young children. Here the acquisition of yeast species was studied in a birth-cohort including 133 healthy Swedish infants. A rectal swab sample was obtained on day 3 of life, and fresh fecal samples were obtained at regular intervals up to 3 years of age; the samples were cultured quantitatively for yeasts. Colonization with yeasts increased rapidly in the first months of life, with 73/133 infants (55%) colonized at 6 months of age. The yeast numbers in positive samples decreased from an average of 105 cfu/g in infants aged 0-2 months to 103.5 cfu/g at 3 years of age. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species and reached higher population counts than the other species in culture-positive infants. The yeast colonization rate did not differ between infants who were delivered vaginally and those birthed via Caesarean section, whereas breastfed infants showed a lower colonization rate (p < 0.05 for 1 year of age compared to the other infants). The results demonstrate that yeasts, particularly C. albicans and C. parapsilosis (sensu lato), are common commensals in the gut microbiota of healthy infants and young children.",

This study aims to clarify the distribution of G/P types and genetic characteristics of RVAs circulating in Thailand. Between January 2014 and September 2016, 1867 stool specimens were collected from children and adults with acute gastroenteritis in six provinces in Thailand. RVAs were detected in 514/1867 (27.5%) stool specimens. G1P[8] (44.7%) was the most predominant genotype, followed by G3P[8] (33.7%), G2P[4] (11.5%), G8P[8] (7.0%), and G9P[8] (1.3%).

In contrast, the frequency of G3P[8] markedly increased from 5.5% in 2014 to 65.3% in 2015 and 89.8% in 2016. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, most (135/140; 96.4%) of the G3P[8] strains exhibited a short RNA profile. Successful determination of the nucleotide sequences of the VP7 genes of 98 G3P[8] strains with a short RNA profile showed that they are all equine-like G3P[8] strains. On phylogenetic analysis of genome segments of two representative Thai equine-like G3P[8] strains, it was noteworthy that they possessed distinct NSP4 genes, one bovine-like and the other human-like. Thus, we found that characteristic equine-like G3P[8] strains with a short RNA electropherotype are becoming highly prevalent in children and adults in Thailand.",

In vitro studies have suggested that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in breast milk promote the formation of a bifidobacteria-rich microbiota in infant guts; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we characterized two functionally distinct but overlapping fucosyllactose transporters (FL transporter-1 and -2) from Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis. Fecal DNA and HMO consumption analyses, combined with deposited metagenome data mining, revealed that FL transporter-2 is primarily associated with the bifidobacteria-rich microbiota formation in breast-fed infant guts. Structural analyses of the solute-binding protein (SBP) of FL transporter-2 complexed with 2'-fucosyllactose and 3-fucosyllactose, together with phylogenetic analysis of SBP homologs of both FL transporters, highlight a unique adaptation strategy of Bifidobacterium to HMOs, in which the gain-of-function mutations enable FL transporter-2 to efficiently capture major fucosylated HMOs. Our results provide a molecular insight into HMO-mediated symbiosis and coevolution between bifidobacteria and humans.",

In human preterm and full-term mother-infant dyads at the time of cesarean delivery, the oral cavity and meconium of newborn infants born as early as 24 weeks of gestation contained a microbiota that was predicted to originate from in utero sources, including the placenta. Using operative deliveries of pregnant mice under highly controlled, sterile conditions in the laboratory, composition, visualization, and viability of bacteria in the in utero compartment and fetal intestine were demonstrated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and bacterial culture.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infant gut dysbiosis, often associated with low abundance of bifidobacteria, is linked to impaired immune development and inflammation-a risk factor for increased incidence of several childhood diseases. We investigated the impact of B. infantis EVC001 colonization on enteric inflammation in a subset of exclusively breastfed term infants from a larger clinical study. METHODS: Stool samples (n = 120) were collected from infants randomly selected to receive either 1.8 x 10(10) CFU B. infantis EVC001 daily for 21 days (EVC001) or breast milk alone (controls), starting at day 7 postnatal. The fecal microbiome was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA, proinflammatory cytokines using multiplexed immunoassay, and fecal calprotectin using ELISA at three time points: days 6 (Baseline), 40, and 60 postnatal. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin concentration negatively correlated with Bifidobacterium abundance (P < 0.0001; rho = -0.72), and proinflammatory cytokines correlated with Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, yet negatively correlated with Bifidobacteriaceae abundance. Proinflammatory cytokines were significantly lower in EVC001-fed infants on days 40 and 60 postnatally compared to baseline and compared to control infants. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that gut dysbiosis (absence of B. infantis) is associated with increased intestinal inflammation. Early addition of EVC001 to diet represents a novel strategy to prevent enteric inflammation during a critical developmental phase.",

			"article_name": "Early-life gut microbiome modulation reduces the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-resistant (AR) bacteria are a global threat. AR bacteria can be acquired in early life and have long-term sequelae. Limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance without triggering the development of additional resistance mechanisms is of immense clinical value. Here, we show how the infant gut microbiome can be modified, resulting in a significant reduction of AR genes (ARGs) and the potentially pathogenic bacteria that harbor them. METHODS: The gut microbiome was characterized using shotgun metagenomics of fecal samples from two groups of healthy, term breastfed infants. One group was fed B. infantis EVC001 in addition to receiving lactation support (n = 29, EVC001-fed), while the other received lactation support alone (n = 31, controls). Coliforms were isolated from fecal samples and genome sequenced, as well as tested for minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. RESULTS: Infants fed B. infantis EVC001 exhibited a change to the gut microbiome, resulting in a 90% lower level of ARGs compared to controls. ARGs that differed significantly between groups were predicted to confer resistance to beta lactams, fluoroquinolones, or multiple drug classes, the majority of which belonged to Escherichia, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus. Minimal inhibitory concentration assays confirmed the resistance phenotypes among isolates with these genes. Notably, we found extended-spectrum beta lactamases among healthy, vaginally delivered breastfed infants who had never been exposed to antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Colonization of the gut of breastfed infants by a single strain of B. longum subsp. infantis had a profound impact on the fecal metagenome, including a reduction in ARGs. This highlights the importance of developing novel approaches to limit the spread of these genes among clinically relevant bacteria. Future studies are needed to determine whether colonization with B. infantis EVC001 decreases the incidence of AR infections in breastfed infants.

Possible impact of intrauterine exposure to meconium on the occurrence of dermatitis and skin rash was proposed. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the possible influence of intrauterine exposure to meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) on the occurrence of dermatitis and skin rash-related hospitalizations throughout childhood. METHODS: Singleton deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single medical centre were divided into two study groups based on presence or lack of MSAF during delivery. Population-based cohort analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were used to study the association between MSAF and cutaneous morbidity-related hospitalizations. RESULTS: A lower rate of the total dermatitis or skin eruption-related hospitalization was documented in the MSAF-exposed group; 0.78 per 1000-person years (0.9%, n = 312), as compared to 0.98 per 1000-person years in the unexposed group (1.0%, n = 1992) with a hazard ratio of 0.86 (95% CI 0.76-0.96, P = 0.011). The survival curve showed lower cumulative hospitalization rate in the MSAF-exposed group as compared to the unexposed group (log rank P = 0.01). The Cox analysis, controlled for confounders, demonstrated MSAF exposure to be an independent protective factor for dermatitis and skin rash-related hospitalizations during childhood (adjusted HR 0.878 (95% CI 0.779-0.990, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Fetal exposure to MSAF appears to be an independent protective factor for dermatitis and skin rash-related hospitalizations in the offspring throughout childhood and adolescence.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nosocomial sepsis is the main problem that preterms have to face during their stay at neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Serratia marcescens is an emerging cause of preterm sepsis but its epidemiology is still largely unknown. Consequently, the aims of this study were to know the rate of preterms colonized by S. marcescens during their stay at the NICU and the characteristics and evolution of the S. marcescens population, including the susceptibility to clinically relevant antibiotics. METHODS: Twenty-six preterm infants born with a gestational age </= 32 weeks and/or weigh </=1500 g were included in the study. Samples of meconium and feces (n = 92) were collected during their first month of life of the infants, together with feeding samples after their pass through enteral feeding tubes (n = 37). Samples were inoculated on MacConkey agar plates. The isolates identified as S. marcescens were genotyped using RAPD and PFGE; and antibiotics susceptibility was performed in a Vitek 2 system. RESULTS: A total of 179 S. marcescens isolates were obtained from the samples. PFGE profiling and cluster analysis allowed the classification of the isolates into 7 different S. marcescens clones. PFGE patterns 1 and 3 were the dominant strains in the fecal samples colonizing 31 and 35% of the infants, respectively. Those isolates causing bacteremia in two infants clustered in PFGE pattern 3. CONCLUSION: S. marcescens is a bacterial species closely associated to the NICU environment. It can be frequently isolated from preterm's feces although only some genetic lineages seem to be associated to sepsis. Enteral feeding tubes act as important reservoirs to keep the S. marcescens population in the NICU. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The local ethic committee approved this trial with the reference 09/157.",

In this study, the prevalence of fecal contamination on children's toys was determined using total coliform and E. coli as bacterial fecal indicators. The prevalence of diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains were used as an indication of the potential health risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out for 3 months in rural communities in the Vhembe district, Limpopo province of South Africa. Nonporous plastic toys (n = 137) used by children under 5 years of age in households and day care centres (DCCs) from rural villages were collected for assessment. New toys (n = 109) were provided to the households and DCCs and collected again after 4 weeks. Microbiological assessment was carried out using the Colilert((R)) Quanti-Tray/2000 system. Diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains were identified using a published multiplex PCR protocol. RESULTS: Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions of the children in the households and DCCs were assessed. Statistical analysis was used to identify the relationship between fecal contamination of the existing and introduced toys. All the existing and introduced toy samples, both from DCCs and households, tested positive for total coliform counts and 61 existing and introduced toy samples tested positive for E. coli counts. Diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains identified included EHEC, ETEC, EPEC, EIEC and EAEC. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that water, sanitation and hygiene conditions could be responsible in the contamination of children's toys and the transmission of diarrhoea to young children.",

Milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is a biologically functional fraction of milk increasingly linked to beneficial outcomes in infants through protection from pathogens, modulation of the immune system and improved neurodevelopment. In the present study, we characterized the fecal microbiome and metabolome of infants fed a bovine MFGM supplemented experimental formula (EF) and compared to infants fed standard formula (SF) and a breast-fed reference group. The impact of MFGM on the fecal microbiome was moderate; however, the fecal metabolome of EF-fed infants showed a significant reduction of several metabolites including lactate, succinate, amino acids and their derivatives from that of infants fed SF. Introduction of weaning food with either human milk or infant formula reduces the distinct characteristics of breast-fed- or formula-fed- like infant fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles.

OBJECTIVES: The present study describes the presence and genetic diversity of AiV in patients with gastroenteritis in Northwestern Spain. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 2667 stool samples, obtained between July 2010 and June 2011, from diarrheic outpatients were studied for detection and molecular characterization of AiV using PCR techniques followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: The virus was detected in 124 (5.0%) of the samples among all age groups. Coinfections were also detected, from the 124 positive samples, 72 (58.1%) were positive only for AiV, whereas mixed contaminations with Norovirus genogroup I or genogroup II, Sapovirus, or other enteric pathogens were detected in 52 (41.9%) samples.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Open defecation is widespread in rural India, and few households have piped water connections. While government and other efforts have increased toilet coverage in India, and evaluations found limited immediate impacts on health, longer-term effects have not been rigorously assessed. METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study to assess the longer-term effectiveness of a combined household-level piped water and sanitation intervention implemented by Gram Vikas (an Indian NGO) in rural Odisha, India. Forty-five intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of those where implementation was previously completed at least 5 years before, and matched to 45 control villages. We conducted surveys and collected stool samples between June 2015 and October 2016 in households with a child <5 years of age (n = 2398). Health surveillance included diarrhoea (primary outcome), acute respiratory infection (ARI), soil-transmitted helminth infection, and anthropometry. RESULTS: Intervention villages had higher improved toilet coverage (85% vs 18%), and increased toilet use by adults (74% vs 13%) and child faeces disposal (35% vs 6%) compared with control villages. There was no intervention association with diarrhoea [adjusted OR (aOR): 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-1.20] or ARI. Compared with controls, children in intervention villages had lower helminth infection (aOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.00) and improved height-for-age z scores (HAZ) (+0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.31). CONCLUSIONS: This combined intervention, where household water connections were contingent on community-wide household toilet construction, was associated with improved HAZ, and reduced soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection, though not reduced diarrhoea or ARI. Further research should explore the mechanism through which these heterogenous effects on health may occur.",

Owing to lack of proper surveillance programs and health facilities, developing countries of Asia and Africa carry a disproportionately heavy share of the RVA disease burden. The aim of this hospital-based study was to investigate the circulation of RVA genotypes in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan in 2015 and 2016, prior to the implementation of RVA vaccine. 639 faecal samples collected from children under 10 years of age hospitalized with AGE were tested for RVA antigen by ELISA. Among 171 ELISA positive samples, 143 were successfully screened for RT-PCR and sequencing. The prevalence of RVA was found to be 26.8% with the highest frequency (34.9%) found among children of age group 6-11 months. The most predominant circulating genotypes were G3P[8] (22.4%) followed by G12P[6] (20.3%), G2P[4] (12.6%), G1P[8] (11.9%), G9P[6] (11.9%), G3P[4] (9.1%), G1P[6] (4.2%), G9P[8] (4.2%), and G3P[6] (0.7%). A single mixed genotype G1G3P[8] was also detected. The findings of this study provide baseline data, that will help to assess if future vaccination campaigns using currently available RVA vaccine will reduce RVA disease burden and instigate evolutionary changes in the overall RVA biology. The high prevalence of RVA infections in Pakistan require to improve and strengthen the surveillance and monitoring system for RVA. This will provide useful information for health authorities in planning public health care strategies to mitigate the disease burden caused by RVA.",

			"abstract": "Altogether, 20-30% of women receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to prevent sepsis in infants and 2-5% of newborn infants receive antibiotics due to suspected sepsis. Caesarean section has a long-term impact on the intestinal microbiome but the effects of perinatal antibiotics on gut microbiome in vaginally delivered infants are not well known. We compared the impact of IAP, postnatal antibiotics, or their combination on the gut microbiome and emergence of antimicrobial resistance in a controlled study of 149 newborn infants recruited within 24 hours after birth. We collected 659 fecal samples, including 426 daily samples from infants before discharge from the hospital and 111 follow-up samples at six months. Penicillin was mostly used for IAP and the combination of penicillin and aminoglycoside for postnatal treatment. Postnatal antibiotic groups received Lactobacillus reuteri probiotic. Newborn gut colonization differed in both IAP and postnatal antibiotics groups as compared to that in control group. The effect size of IAP was comparable to that caused by postnatal antibiotics. The observed differences were still present at six months and not prevented by lactobacilli consumption. Given the present clinical results, the impact of perinatal antibiotics on the subsequent health of newborn infants should be further evaluated.",

			"abstract": "Antenatal milk anti-influenza antibodies may provide additional protection to newborns until they are able to produce their own antibodies. To evaluate the relative abundance of milk, we studied the antibodies specific to influenza A in feeds and gastric contents and stools from preterm infants fed mother's own breast milk (MBM) and donor breast milk (DBM). Feed (MBM or DBM) and gastric contents (MBM or DBM at 1 h post-ingestion) and stool samples (MBM/DBM at 24 h post-ingestion) were collected, respectively, from 20 preterm (26-36 weeks gestational age) mother-infant pairs at 8-9 days and 21-22 days of postnatal age. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-H1N1 hemagglutinin (anti-H1N1 HA) and anti-H3N2 neuraminidase (anti-H3N2 NA) specificity across immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotypes. The relative abundance of influenza A-specific IgA in feeds and gastric contents were higher in MBM than DBM at 8-9 days of postnatal age but did not differ at 21-22 days. Anti-influenza A-specific IgM was higher in MBM than in DBM at both postnatal times in feed and gastric samples. At both postnatal times, anti-influenza A-specific IgG was higher in MBM than DBM but did not differ in gastric contents. Gastric digestion reduced anti-H3N2 NA IgG from MBM at 21-22 days and from DBM at 8-9 days of lactation, whereas other anti-influenza A antibodies were not digested at either postnatal times. Supplementation of anti-influenza A-specific antibodies in DBM may help reduce the risk of influenza virus infection. However, the effective antibody dose required to induce a significant protective effect remains unknown.",

However, the mechanism, source and contribution of this lipid to allergic inflammation remain unknown. Here, we show that intra-abdominal treatment of mice with 12,13-diHOME increased pulmonary inflammation and decreased the number of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells in the lungs. Treatment of human dendritic cells with 12,13-diHOME altered expression of PPARgamma-regulated genes and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion and the number of T(reg) cells in vitro. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of neonatal faeces indicated that bacterial epoxide hydrolase (EH) genes are more abundant in the gut microbiome of neonates who develop atopy and/or asthma during childhood. Three of these bacterial EH genes (3EH) specifically produce 12,13-diHOME, and treatment of mice with bacterial strains expressing 3EH caused a decrease in the number of lung T(reg) cells in an allergen challenge model. In two small birth cohorts, an increase in the copy number of 3EH or the concentration of 12,13-diHOME in the faeces of neonates was found to be associated with an increased probability of developing atopy, eczema or asthma during childhood. Our data indicate that elevated 12,13-diHOME concentrations impede immune tolerance and may be produced by bacterial EHs in the neonatal gut, offering a mechanistic link between perturbation of the gut microbiome during early life and atopy and asthma during childhood.",

			"article_name": "Prevalence and associated factors of safe and improved infant and young children stool disposal in Ethiopia: evidence from demographic and health survey.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infant and young children stools are often considered innocuous, and are not disposed of safely despite having a higher pathogen load than adult feces. In Ethiopia, sanitary management of young children's stool is often overlooked and transmission of fecal-oral diseases is still a significant health burden. The study, therefore, describes the prevalence and associated factors of safe and improved child stool disposal. METHODS: Data from the fourth round of the Ethiopian Health and Demographic Survey (EDHS) conducted in 2016 was used for this analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with safe and improved child stool disposal. RESULTS: The prevalence of safe and improved child stool disposal in Ethiopia was 36.9% (95%CI: 33.4-40.5%) and 5.3% (95%CI: 4.3-6.5%) respectively. There was regional variation in the prevalence of safe and improved child stool disposal. The odds of safe stool disposal among households with richest wealth index had 4.54 (AOR: 4.54; 95%CI: 2.89-7.12), richer 3.64 (AOR: 3.64; 95%CI: 2.46-5.38), middle 3.26 (AOR: 2.26; 95%CI: 2.27-4.68), and poorer 1.93 (AOR: 1.93; 95%CI: 1.39-2.68) times higher odds of practicing safe child stool disposal than households with poorest wealth index. Similarly, households found in richest, richer, middle, and poorer wealth index had also (AOR: 20.23; 95%CI: 8.59-47.66), (AOR: 12.53; 95%CI: 5.59-28.10) (AOR: 4.91; 95%CI: 1.92-12.55), and (AOR: 4.50; 95%CI: 2.06-9.84) higher odds of practicing improved child stool disposal than households from poorest wealth index respectively. The odds of safe child stool disposal were higher among households whose children age between 6 and 11 months (AOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.17-2.09), 12-17 months (AOR: 1.39; 95%CI: 1.00-1.95), and 18-23 months (AOR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.03-1.99) than households whose children age between 0 and 5 months. The odds of safe child stool disposal were 1.31 (AOR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.00-1.72) and 1.44 (AOR: 1.44; 95%CI: 1.04-2.01) times higher among mothers whose age between 25 and 34 and greater than 34 years compared to mothers whose age between 15 and 24 years, respectively. In addition, children's stools are more likely to be disposed of safely in urban households than in rural households (AOR: 3.12; 95%CI: 1.86-5.22). The present study also revealed households with access to improved sanitation facilities fail to use them for disposal of child stool (AOR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.67-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of safe and improved child stool disposal in Ethiopia was found to be very low. Household socio-demographic and economic determinate were the key factors associated with child stool disposal. Appropriate strategic interventions to ensure safe and improved child stool disposal in Ethiopia is necessary. In addition, integrating child stool management into the existing sanitation interventions programs should be strongly recommended.",

The method was linear from limit of quantification (2\u202fng/g) to 200\u202fng/g matrix with good determination coefficient (r(2)\u202f=\u202f0.99). Recovery of EtG from meconium was always higher than 70% and intra-assay and inter-assay precision and accuracy were always better than 10%. Robustness of the developed GC-MS/MS method was tested by analysing 150 real samples coming from a previous national epidemiological project pre-screened through an ultra-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay obtaining a good comparability of results obtained by the two methods.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Noroviruses (NVs) are an important cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. There are limited data on the prevalence and molecular characterization of NVs in children in Hohhot, China. METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2017, 1863 stool samples were collected at Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Hohhot. All samples were screened for NVs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR). RESULTS: NVs were detected in 24.15% of these inpatient cases, ranging from 12.78 to 32.92% in different years. NV was detected throughout the year, with a peak in winter. Based on sequence analysis of the partial VP1 gene, the 306 identified NV strains were divided into six genotypes: GII.3 (71.24%), GII.4 (23.53%), and GII.2, GII.5, GII.6, and GII.13 (total 5.23%). Based on further sequence analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), GII.P12/GII.3, GII.Pe/GII.4, and GII.P4/GII.4 were identified as predominant genotypes, accounting for 92.6% of genotyped strains. The median age of the children with NV infection was 8.0 (range 0-59) months. However, children infected with GII.3 were younger (median 7.0 months) than GII.4-positive patients (median 10.0 months). CONCLUSION: NV contributed greatly to AGE among hospitalized children in Hohhot in China. Continuous surveillance is important for understanding the local prevalence and characterization of NV.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the BD Max enteric viral panel (Max EVP) assay for identification of viral pathogens in stool specimens from individuals with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis. Prospective and archival stool specimens from adult and pediatric patients with diarrhea were collected in Cary-Blair medium or unpreserved containers. The results for specimens tested by the Max EVP (on the BD Max platform) were compared to those obtained by the reference method (alternate PCR assays, followed by bidirectional sequencing). Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated. A total of 2,239 specimens were collected, with 2,148 being included for analysis. In this population, 39.6% of specimens were from outpatients, 42.1% were from patients <21 years old, and 49.7% were from females. Prevalence rates for prospective specimens were 7.3%, 4.5%, 3.5%, 2.4%, and 1.2% for norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and adenovirus, respectively. PPA was 92.8%, 84.9%, 93.0%, 100%, and 95.6%, for norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and adenovirus, respectively. NPA was >/=99.4% for all targets. In conjunction with the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and epidemiological information, the Max EVP assay is effective for the differential diagnosis of enteric disease caused by norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and adenovirus. This assay can be used individually for patients at high risk for a viral enteropathogen (e.g., in outbreak settings) or as an adjunct to other enteric bacterial panels.",

The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) examined the infectious etiologies as well as associated demographics, socioeconomic markers, health-care-seeking behaviors, and handwashing practices of the households of children with diarrhea and their age- and gender-matched controls in seven countries over a 3-year period (December 2007-December 2010). Stool studies to determine diarrheal etiologies and anthropometry were performed at baseline and at 60-day follow-up visits, along with surveys to record demographics and living conditions of the children. We performed secondary analyses of the GEMS data derived from the Bangladesh portion of the study in children with diarrhea associated with viral enteropathogens and explored pathogen-specific features of disease burden. Rotavirus and norovirus were the most prevalent pathogens (39.3% and 35%, respectively). Disease due to rotavirus and adenovirus was more common in infants than in older children (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Height for age decreased from baseline to follow-up in children with diarrhea associated with rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus (P < 0.001). Based on these analyses, preventive measures targeted at rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus will be expected to have meaningful clinical impact. Cost of treatment was highest for rotavirus as well, making it an obvious target for intervention. Association of specific viruses with stunting is particularly notable, as stunting is an attributable risk factor for poor cognitive development and future productivity and economic potential.",

			"abstract": "Removal of sugar moieties from ginsenosides has been proposed to increase their biological effects in various disease models. In order to identify strains that can increase aglycone contents, we performed a screening using bacteria isolated from the feces of infants focusing on acid tolerance and beta-glucosidase activity. We isolated 565 bacteria and selected Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LT 19-2 (LT 19-2), which exhibited the highest beta-glucosidase activity with strong acid tolerance. As red ginseng (RG) has been known to exert immunomodulatory functions, we fermented RG using LT 19-2 (FRG) and investigated whether this could alter the aglycone profile of ginsenosides and improve its immunomodulatory effect. FRG increased macrophage activity more potently compared to RG, demonstrated by higher TNF-alpha and IL-6 production. More importantly, the FRG treatment stimulated the proliferation of mouse splenocytes and increased TNF-alpha levels in bone marrow-derived macrophages, confirming that the enhanced immunomodulatory function can be recapitulated in primary immune cells. Examination of the molecular mechanism revealed that F-RG could induce phosphorylations of ERK, p38, JNK, and NF-kappaB. Analysis of the ginsenoside composition showed a decrease in Rb1, Re, Rc, and Rb3, accompanied by an increase in Rd, Rh1, F2, and Rg3, the corresponding aglycone metabolites, in FRG compared to RG. Collectively, LT 19-2 maybe used as a probiotic strain to improve the bioactivity of functional foods through modifying the aglycone/glycoside profile.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rapid and accurate diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis (TB) is challenging because children are often unable to produce the sputum sample required for conventional tests. Stool is an alternative sample type that is easy to collect from children, and studies investigating the use of stool for molecular detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have led to promising results. Our objective was to evaluate stool as an alternative specimen to sputum for Mtb detection in children. We did so using the TruTip workstation (Akonni Biosystems), a novel automated lysis and extraction platform. METHODS: We tested stool samples from 259 children aged 0-14 years old, in Lima, Peru who presented with TB symptoms. Following extraction with TruTip, we detected the presence of Mtb DNA by IS6110 real-time PCR. We calculated assay sensitivity in two groups: (1) children with culture confirmed TB (N = 22); and (2) children with clinically-diagnosed unconfirmed TB (N = 84). We calculated specificity among children in whom TB was ruled out (N = 153). Among children who were diagnosed with TB, we examined factors associated with a positive stool test. RESULTS: Assay sensitivity was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39-80%) and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.0-6.5%) in children with culture-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed unconfirmed TB, respectively, and specificity was 97% (95% CI: 93-99%). The assay detected Mtb in stool of 7/7 children with smear-positive TB (100% sensitivity; 95% CI: 59-100%), and in 6/15 of children with smear-negative, culture-confirmed TB (40% sensitivity; 95% CI: 16-68%). Older age, smear positivity, culture positivity, ability to produce sputum and cavitary disease were associated with a positive stool result. CONCLUSION: Testing of stool samples with the TruTip workstation and IS6110 amplification yielded sensitivity and specificity estimates comparable to other tests such as Xpert. Future work should include detection of resistance using the TruTip closed amplification system and assay optimization to improve sensitivity in children with low bacillary loads.",

We investigated the antibiotic susceptibility profiles, virulence potentials and genetic relatedness of Campylobacter spp. from paediatric and water samples in the North West Province, South Africa. Overall, 237 human and 20 water isolates were identified using culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using the disk diffusion method. Gradient strips were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of each antibiotic. Antibiotic resistance (gryA, tetO and 23S rRNA 2075G and 2074C) and virulence (cadF and ciaB) genes were also investigated using PCR. A phylogenetic tree to ascertain the clonality between water and clinical isolates was constructed using MEGA 7. Overall, 95% (water) and 64.7% (human) of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic tested. The highest resistance was against clarithromycin (95%) for water and ampicillin (60.7%) for human isolates. The 23S rRNA 2075G/2074C mutation was the most expressed resistance gene. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed eight intermixed clades within water and human Campylobacter isolates. This study suggests the possible circulation of potentially pathogenic antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter in the Northwest Province, South Africa with drinking water being a possible vector for disease transmission in this area.",

			"abstract": "The gut microbiota of infants changes over time and is affected by various factors during early life. However, rarely have studies explored the gut microbiota development and affecting factors in the Chinese infant population. We enrolled 102 infants and collected stool samples from them at birth, 42 days, 3 mo, and 6 mo after delivery to characterize the microbiota signatures and the effects of different factors that modulate the gut microbiota diversity, composition, and function over time. DNA extracted from the bacteria in the stool samples was subjected to high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Microbial richness and diversity increased significantly during the first 6 mo of life. Beneficial microbes such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Blautia were found to be increased in the infant's gut at 6 mo, while pathological bacteria such as Escherichia-Shigella, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella decreased over time. The changes in the infant delivery mode and infant-feeding mode only produced changes in the microbial composition, whereas changes in bacterial richness, diversity and effects sizes on the microbial architecture were all time dependent. A comparison of infant delivery modes conveyed a decrease in abundance of Bacteroidetes over time in the gut of infants born via C-section, while the Bifidobacterium was the most dominant genus in the vaginal delivery group. The gut microbiota of infants changed extensively during the first 6 mo of life. Delivery and feeding modes were strong factors that significantly affected microbial architecture and functions.",

			"article_name": "Molecular epidemiology of human bocavirus in children with acute gastroenteritis from North Region of Brazil.",
			"abstract": "PURPOSE: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a DNA virus that is mostly associated with respiratory infections. However, because it has been found in stool samples, it has been suggested that it may be a causative agent for human enteric conditions. This underpins the continuous search for HBoVs, especially after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine due to acute gastroenteritis cases related to emergent viruses, as HBoVs are more likely to be found in this post-vaccine scenario. Therefore, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the prevalence of HBoV in children aged less than 10 years with acute gastroenteritis in Brazil from November 2011 to November 2012. METHODOLOGY: Stool samples from hospitalized children </=10 years old who presented symptoms of acute gastroenteritis were analysed for the presence of rotavirus A (RVA) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and for HBoV DNA by nested PCR. RESULTS: HBoV positivity was detected in 24.0 % (54/225) of samples. Two peaks of HBoV detection were observed in November 2011 and from July to September 2012. Co-infections between HBoV and rotavirus A were identified in 50.0 % (27/54) of specimens. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of HBoV-1 (94.8 %), HBoV-2 (2.6 %) and HBoV-3 (2.6 %) species, with only minor variations among them. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence for the circulation of most HBoV genotypes (except HBoV-4) in the North Region of Brazil at a considerable rate and further investigations are necessary to improve our knowledge in the context of HBoV infections and their role in gastrointestinal diseases.",

			"abstract": "According to FAO and WHO, probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Most probiotic bacteria used today belong to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and are of animal or human origin. The fundamental characteristic routinely evaluated in potential probiotics strains is their limited viability loss during gastrointestinal transit (GIT), but to date, no studies reported whether probiotics, besides viability, still also maintain their beneficial properties intact. To study this aspect, we considered two strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus DTA 79 and L. paracasei DTA 83, previously characterised for the presence of some probiotic properties, isolated from faeces of 7- to 21-day-old babies. Here, we examined some additional properties, namely antibiotic resistance, resistance to lysozyme, presence of haemolytic activity and inhibition of pathogen biofilm formation. We then tested the effect of in vitro GIT on all these features and our results show evidence that this procedure had in some cases limited and in others no significant effects on them. Additionally, we examined the gastrointestinal resistance of the strains after skim milk fermentation and successive storage of the product for 20 and 40 days at refrigeration temperature, to see whether prolonged storage could weaken cell resistance to GIT. Our results demonstrate that a protracted refrigeration period before in vitro GIT did not affect or influenced very weakly this essential probiotic property.",

Neonatal OF and infant feces (IF) were collected immediately and one month after birth from 15 healthy vaginally delivered newborns. Bifidobacterium strains were isolated from OF and IF samples, and the similarity of strains between the OF-IF pairs was evaluated based on the average nucleotide identity (ANI) value. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results revealed the presence of Bifidobacteriaceae at >1% relative abundance in all OF samples. Bifidobacterium strains were isolated from OF (9/15) and IF (11/15) samples, and those sharing high genomic homology (ANI values >99.5%) between the neonatal OF and IF samples were present in one-third of the OF-IF pairs. The results of this study indicate that viable bifidobacteria are present in neonatal OF and that OF at birth is a possible transmission route of bifidobacteria to the infant gut.",

			"abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are a major cause of morbidity in tropical developing countries with a global infection prevalence of more than one billion people and disease burden of around 3.4 million disability adjusted life years. Infection prevalence directly correlates to inadequate sanitation, impoverished conditions and limited access to public health systems. Underestimation of infection prevalence using traditional microscopy-based diagnostic techniques is common, specifically in populations with access to benzimidazole mass treatment programs and a predominance of low intensity infections. In this study, we developed a multiplexed-tandem qPCR (MT-PCR) tool to identify and quantify STH eggs in stool samples. We have assessed this assay by measuring infection prevalence and intensity in field samples of two cohorts of participants from Timor-Leste and Cambodia, which were collected as part of earlier epidemiological studies. MT-PCR diagnostic parameters were compared to a previously published multiplexed qPCR for STH detection. The MT-PCR assay agreed strongly with qPCR data and showed a diagnostic specificity of 99.60-100.00% (sensitivity of 83.33-100.00%) compared to qPCR and kappa agreement exceeding 0.85 in all tests. In addition, the MT-PCR has the added advantage of distinguishing Ancylostoma spp. species, namely Ancylostoma duodenale and Ancylostoma ceylanicum. This semi-automated platform uses a standardized, manufactured reagent kit, shows excellent run-to-run consistency/repeatability and supports high-throughput detection and quantitation at a moderate cost.",

			"abstract": "PURPOSE: Low birth weight (LBW) infants have a less diverse gut microbiota, enriched in potential pathogens, which places them at high risk of systemic inflammation diseases. This study aimed to identify the differences in gut bacterial community structure between LBW infants who received probiotics and LBW infants who did not receive probiotics. METHODS: Forty-one infants were allocated to the non-probiotic group (N group) and 56 infants to the probiotic group (P group), according to whether the formula they received contained a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis. Gut bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected at 14 days after birth. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the alpha diversity of the two groups, while the beta diversity was significantly different (p < 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (both p < 0.05) were enriched in the P group, while Veillonella, Dolosigranulum and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (all p < 0.05) were enriched in the N group. Predicted metagenome function analysis revealed enhancement of fatty acids, peroxisome, starch, alanine, tyrosine and peroxisome pathways in the P group, and enhancement of plant pathogen, Salmonella and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways in the N group. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplement in formula may affect the composition, stability and function of LBW infants' gut microbiota.

The gut microbe assemblages of preterm infants have been reported to be different from that of healthy term infants. However, the patterns of ecosystem development and inter-individual differences remain poorly understood. We investigated hospitalised preterm infant gut microbiota development using 16S rRNA gene amplicons and the metabolic profiles of 268 stool samples obtained from 17 intensive care and 42 term infants to elucidate the dynamics and equilibria of the developing microbiota. Infant gut microbiota were predominated by Gram-positive cocci, Enterobacteriaceae or Bifidobacteriaceae, which showed sequential transitions to Bifidobacteriaceae-dominated microbiota. In neonatal intensive care unit preterm infants (NICU preterm infants), Staphylococcaceae abundance was higher immediately after birth than in healthy term infants, and Bifidobacteriaceae colonisation tended to be delayed. No specific NICU-cared infant enterotype-like cluster was observed, suggesting that the constrained environment only affected the pace of transition, but not infant gut microbiota equilibrium. Moreover, infants with Bifidobacteriaceae-dominated microbiota showed higher acetate concentrations and lower pH, which have been associated with host health. Our data provides an in-depth understanding of gut microbiota development in NICU preterm infants and complements earlier studies. Understanding the patterns and inter-individual differences of the preterm infant gut ecosystem is the first step towards controlling the risk of diseases in premature infants by targeting intestinal microbiota.",

In order to investigate biological features that allow this bifidobacterial species to colonize a newborn, bifidobacterial internally transcribed spacer profiling of stool samples of 50 mother-infant dyads, as well as corresponding breastmilk samples, was performed. Hierarchical clustering based on bifidobacterial population profiles found in infant faecal samples revealed the presence of four bifidobacterial clusters or the so-called bifidotypes. Bifidobacterium bifidum was shown to be a key member among bifidotypes, in which its presence correlate with several different bifidobacterial species retrieved in infant faecal samples. For this reason, we investigated cross-feeding behaviour facilitated by B. bifidum on a bioreactor model using human milk as growth substrate. Transcriptional profiles of this strain were evaluated when grown on nine specific glycans typically constituting HMOs. Remarkably, these analyses suggest extensive co-evolution with the host and other bifidobacterial species in terms of resource provision and sharing, respectively, activities that appear to support a bifidobacteria-dominant microbiome.",

Preterm infants are disproportionately affected by growth failure and its effects. Herein we found that extremely preterm infants with postnatal growth failure have disrupted maturation of the intestinal microbiota, characterized by persistently low diversity, dominance of pathogenic bacteria within the Enterobacteriaceae family, and a paucity of strictly anaerobic taxa including Veillonella relative to infants with appropriate postnatal growth. Metabolomic profiling of infants with growth failure demonstrated elevated serum acylcarnitines, fatty acids, and other byproducts of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Machine learning algorithms for normal maturation of the microbiota and metabolome among infants with appropriate growth revealed a pattern of delayed maturation of the microbiota and metabolome among infants with growth failure.

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study was conducted between 2012 and 2017 in a tertiary care setting on a prospective cohort of children with cholestasis occurring at </=1 year of age and persisting >/=6 weeks, to measure the detection rate of underlying monogenic diseases. After the exclusion of biliary atresia, a clinically driven genetic testing was performed, entailing 3 different approaches with different wideness: confirmatory single-gene testing; focused virtual panels; and wide search through trio whole-exome sequencing. RESULTS: We enrolled 125 children (66 female, median age 2 months); 96 (77%) patients had hypocholic stools and were evaluated rapidly to exclude biliary atresia, which was the final diagnosis in 74 (59%). Overall, 50 patients underwent genetic testing, 6 with single confirmatory gene testing, 38 through panels, and 6 with trio whole-exome sequencing because of complex phenotype. The genetic testing detection rate was 60%: the final diagnosis was Alagille syndrome in 11, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 in 6, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in 3, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 in 2; a further 7 genetic conditions were identified in 1 child each. Overall, only 18 of 125 (14%) remained with an indeterminate etiology. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol combining clinical and genetic assessment proved to be an effective diagnostic tool for neonatal/infantile cholestasis, identifying inherited disorders with a high detection rate. It also could allow a noninvasive diagnosis in children presenting with colored stools.",

We sought to record the acquisition of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in healthy infants in Northern Thailand and investigated potential determinants. METHODS: Stool samples from 142 infants after birth, at ages 2wk, 2mo, 4 to 6mo, and 1y, and parent stool samples were screened for E. coli resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and cefazoline by culture, and isolates were further investigated for multiresistance by disc diffusion method. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to identify persistent and transmitted strains. Genetic comparison of resistant and transmitted strains was done by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and strains were further investigated for extra- and intra-intestinal virulence factors by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Forty-seven (33%) neonatal meconium samples contained resistant E. coli. Prevalence increased continuously: After 1y, resistance proportion (tetracycline 80%, ampicillin 72%, co-trimoxazole 66%, cefazoline 35%) almost matched those in parents. In 8 infants (6%), identical E. coli strains were found in at least 3 sampling time points (suggesting persistence). Transmission of resistant E. coli from parents to child was observed in only 8 families. MLST showed high diversity. We could not identify any virulence genes or factors associated with persistence, or transmission of resistant E. coli. Full-term, vaginal birth and birth in rural hospital were identified as risk factors for early childhood colonization with resistant E. coli. CONCLUSION: One third of healthy Thai neonates harboured antibiotic-resistant E. coli in meconium. The proportion of resistant E. coli increased during the first year of life almost reaching the value in adults. We hypothesize that enhancement of infection control measures and cautious use of antibiotics may help to control further increase of resistance.",

The aim was to sequentially analyze the gut microbiota establishment in low-birth-weight preterm neonates admitted to a single neonatal intensive care unit during their first 3 weeks of life, comparing two epidemiological scenarios. Seven control infants were recruited, and another 12 during a severe S. marcescens outbreak. Meconium and feces from days 7, 14, and 21 of life were collected. Gut microbiota composition was determined by 16S rDNA massive sequencing. Cultivable isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, with four S. marcescens submitted for whole-genome sequencing. The expected bacterial ecosystem expansion after birth is delayed, possibly related to antibiotic exposure. The Proteobacteria phylum dominates, although with marked interindividual variability. The outbreak group considerably differed from the control group, with higher densities of Escherichia coli and Serratia to the detriment of Enterococcus and other Firmicutes. Curiously, obligate predators were only detected in meconium and at very low concentrations. Genotyping of cultivable bacteria demonstrated the high bacterial horizontal transmission rate that was confirmed with whole-genome sequencing for S. marcescens. Preterm infants admitted at NICU are initially colonized by homogeneous microbial communities, most of them from the nosocomial environment, which subsequently evolve according to the individual conditions.

Relative Bifidobacterium abundance tended to increase more in MVP controls compared to the intervention group. Abundance of pathogens was not increased in the intervention group. Higher relative Bifidobacterium abundance was associated with improved weight gain. CONCLUSION: Nutrition may affect richness, diversity, and microbiota composition. There was no increase in relative abundance of pathogens among infants receiving enhanced nutrient supply. Favorable microbiota development was associated with improved weight gain.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal gastrointestinal (GI) bacterial community structure may be related to bacterial communities of the mother, including those of her milk. However, very little is known about the diversity in and relationships among complex bacterial communities in mother-infant dyads. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to assess whether microbiomes of milk are associated with those of oral and fecal samples of healthy lactating women and their infants. METHODS: Samples were collected 9 times from day 2 to 6 mo postpartum from 21 healthy lactating women and their infants. Milk was collected via complete breast expression, oral samples via swabs, and fecal samples from tissue (mothers) and diapers (infants). Microbiomes were characterized using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Alpha and beta diversity indices were used to compare microbiomes across time and sample types. Membership and composition of microbiomes were analyzed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The contribution of various bacterial communities of the mother-infant dyad to both milk and infant fecal bacterial communities were estimated using SourceTracker2. RESULTS: Bacterial community structures were relatively unique to each sample type. The most abundant genus in milk and maternal and infant oral samples was Streptococcus (47.1% +/- 2.3%, 53.9% +/- 1.3%, and 69.1% +/- 1.8%, respectively), whereas Bacteroides were predominant in maternal and infant fecal microbiomes (22.9% +/- 1.3% and 21.4% +/- 2.4%, respectively). The milk microbiome was more similar to the infant oral microbiome than the infant fecal microbiome. However, CCA suggested strong associations between the complex microbial communities of milk and those of all other sample types collected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest complex microbial interactions between breastfeeding mothers and their infants and support the hypothesis that variation in the milk microbiome may influence the infant GI microbiome.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Premature infants often require parenteral nutrition (PN) until they reach enteral autonomy which puts them at risk of developing PN-associated cholestasis (PNAC). We sought to compare longitudinal changes in fecal microbiomes of premature infants who developed PNAC versus those who did not despite being on similar PN doses. METHODS: Stool samples from premature infants (gestational age <30 weeks) who developed direct bilirubin >/=1.5 mg/dL while receiving PN were classified as precholestasis, cholestasis, or postcholestasis based on bilirubin levels at the time of sample acquisition and were compared to matched control groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 102 fecal samples from 8 cases and 10 controls were analyzed. Precholestasis samples were more abundant in phylum Firmicutes and genus Staphylococcus, whereas control 1 was more abundant in phylum Proteobacteria and genus Escherichia-Shigella. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination plots based on the taxonomic composition of early fecal samples revealed significant separation between cases and controls. On indicator species analysis, genus Bacilli was more prevalent in samples from the precholestasis group, whereas genus Escherichia-Shigella was more prevalent in control 1. With feeding advances, weaning of PN and resolution of PNAC, most differences in microbiota resolved with the exception of control 3 group being more diverse compared to the postcholestasis group. CONCLUSIONS: Premature neonates who develop PNAC, compared to those who do not, show significantly different fecal microbiomes preceding the biochemical detection of cholestasis.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess in mothers giving birth by cesarean delivery if prophylactic antibiotics administered either before skin incision or immediately after cutting the umbilical cord influences gut microbiota colonization and antibiotic susceptibility of the gut bacteria in the newborn. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-two pregnant women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were recruited at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, and randomly assigned to receive cefuroxime either before skin incision or immediately after the umbilical cord was cut. Fecal samples were collected from all infants at age 10 days and 9 months. Composition of the gut microbiota was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing. Gram-positive cocci and Enterobacteriaceae were isolated and identified before antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by disk diffusion. RESULTS: No clear difference in the composition of the gut microbiota was observed between infants whose mothers received cefuroxime before or after cesarean delivery at neither time point, though surprisingly at 9 months of age, but not at 10 days of age, the number of observed species was higher in infants where mothers received cefuroxime after cord clamping. No differences in antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp, and Staphylococcus spp were seen at 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of cefuroxime administration to mothers undergoing cesarean delivery does not have a major effect on the gut microbiota and bacterial antibiotic resistance traits in infants.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prenatal and early life bacterial colonisation is thought to play a major role in shaping the immune system. Furthermore, accumulating evidence links early life exposures to the risk of developing IBD later in life. We aimed to assess the effect of maternal IBD on the composition of the microbiome during pregnancy and on the offspring's microbiome. METHODS: We prospectively examined the diversity and taxonomy of the microbiome of pregnant women with and without IBD and their babies at multiple time points. We evaluated the role of maternal IBD diagnosis, the mode of delivery, antibiotic use and feeding behaviour on the microbiome composition during early life. To assess the effects of IBD-associated maternal and infant microbiota on the enteric immune system, we inoculated germ-free mice (GFM) with the respective stool and profiled adaptive and innate immune cell populations in the murine intestines. RESULTS: Pregnant women with IBD and their offspring presented with lower bacterial diversity and altered bacterial composition compared with control women and their babies. Maternal IBD was the main predictor of the microbiota diversity in the infant gut at 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days of life. Babies born to mothers with IBD demonstrated enrichment in Gammaproteobacteria and depletion in Bifidobacteria. Finally, GFM inoculated with third trimester IBD mother and 90-day infant stools showed significantly reduced microbial diversity and fewer class-switched memory B cells and regulatory T cells in the colon. CONCLUSION: Aberrant gut microbiota composition persists during pregnancy with IBD and alters the bacterial diversity and abundance in the infant stool. The dysbiotic microbiota triggered abnormal imprinting of the intestinal immune system in GFM.",

			"abstract": "Maternal antibody transfer to the newborn provides essential support for the infant's naive immune system. Preterm infants normally receive maternal antibodies through mother's own breast milk (MBM) or, when mothers are unable to provide all the milk required, donor breast milk (DBM). DBM is pasteurized and exposed to several freeze-thaw cycles, which could reduce intact antibody concentration and the antibody's resistance to digestion within the infant. Whether concentrations of antibodies in MBM and DBM differ and whether their survival across digestion in preterm infants differs remains unknown. Feed (MBM or DBM), gastric contents (MBM or DBM at 1-h post-ingestion) and stool samples (collected after a mix of MBM and DBM feeding) were collected from 20 preterm (26-36 weeks gestational age) mother-infant pairs at 8-9 and 21-22 days of postnatal age. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for the concentration of secretory IgA (SIgA), total IgA (SIgA/IgA), total IgM (SIgM/IgM) and IgG. Total IgA, SIgA, total IgM and IgG concentrations were 55.0%, 71.6%, 98.4% and 41.1% higher in MBM than in DBM, and were 49.8%, 32.7%, 73.9% and 39.7% higher in gastric contents when infants were fed with MBM than when infants were fed DBM, respectively. All maternal antibody isotypes present in breast milk were detected in the infant stools, of which IgA (not sIgA) was the most abundant.",

			"abstract": "In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the availability and abuse of synthetic cathinones - new amphetamine-like stimulants. Even though their abuse during pregnancy could have serious adverse effects on the fetus, cathinones are not readily included in neonatal toxicological screenings. Meconium (first neonatal stool) is the specimen of choice to reveal long term drug exposure, however as it is a highly complex matrix, the sample preparation is a critical step before the instrumental analysis. The aim of this work was to develop a suitable meconium sample extraction technique using the advantages of salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) and using only MS-friendly organic ammonium salts. We further developed and validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry method for the determination of 'traditional' stimulants (methamphetamine, amphetamine, MDMA) and cathinones (mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (alpha-PVP), methylone, butylone, flephedrone, and naphyrone). Matrix-matched calibration was prepared in the concentration range 10-2000 ng/g. The limits of quantification were determined as 10 ng/g, recoveries ranged from 48.2% to 94.3% and the matrix effect was between 60.2% and 101.4%. Accuracy (86.1-114.5%) and precision (4.9-14.9%) were determined and all validation criteria were met for all analytes except for naphyrone. Finally, our analytical method was tested on a set of real meconium samples, which were found positive for amphetamine, methamphetamine and methylone, thus demonstrating the validity of the method.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Establishment and development of the infant gastrointestinal microbiome (GIM) varies cross-culturally and is thought to be influenced by factors such as gestational age, birth mode, diet, and antibiotic exposure. However, there is little data as to how the composition of infants' households may play a role, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective. Here, we examined relationships between infant fecal microbiome (IFM) diversity/composition and infants' household size, number of siblings, and number of other household members. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 377 fecal samples from healthy, breastfeeding infants across 11 sites in eight different countries (Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Peru, Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Fecal microbial community structure was determined by amplifying, sequencing, and classifying (to the genus level) the V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Surveys administered to infants' mothers identified household members and composition. RESULTS: Our results indicated that household composition (represented by the number of cohabitating siblings and other household members) did not have a measurable impact on the bacterial diversity, evenness, or richness of the IFM. However, we observed that variation in household composition categories did correspond to differential relative abundances of specific taxa, namely: Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella. DISCUSSION: This study, to our knowledge, is the largest cross-cultural study to date examining the association between household composition and the IFM. Our results indicate that the social environment of infants (represented here by the proxy of household composition) may influence the bacterial composition of the infant GIM, although the mechanism is unknown. A higher number and diversity of cohabitants and potential caregivers may facilitate social transmission of beneficial bacteria to the infant gastrointestinal tract, by way of shared environment or through direct physical and social contact between the maternal-infant dyad and other household members. These findings contribute to the discussion concerning ways by which infants are influenced by their social environments and add further dimensionality to the ongoing exploration of social transmission of gut microbiota and the \"old friends\" hypothesis.",

DESIGN: Prospective study of infants in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS). SETTINGS: Rural New Hampshire, USA. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Two hundred and sixty-six full-term infants from the NHBCS. METHODS: Intrapartum antibiotic use during labour and delivery was abstracted from medical records. Faecal samples collected at 6 weeks and 1 year of age were characterised by 16S rRNA sequencing, and metagenomics analysis in a subset of samples. EXPOSURES: Maternal exposure to antibiotics during labour and delivery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Taxonomic and functional profiles of faecal samples. RESULTS: Infant exposure to intrapartum antibiotics, particularly to two or more antibiotic classes, was independently associated with lower microbial diversity scores as well as a unique bacterial community at 6 weeks (GUnifrac, P = 0.02). At 1 year, infants in the penicillin-only group had significantly lower alpha diversity scores than infants not exposed to intrapartum antibiotics. Within the first year of life, intrapartum exposure to penicillins was related to a significantly lower increase in several taxa including Bacteroides, use of cephalosporins was associated with a significantly lower rise over time in Bifidobacterium and infants in the multi-class group experienced a significantly higher increase in Veillonella dispar. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that intrapartum antibiotics alter the developmental trajectory of the infant gut microbiome, and specific antibiotic types may impact community composition, diversity and keystone immune training taxa.

The diversity and unequal geographical prevalence of rotavirus genotypes have been linked to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in different human populations. In order to evaluate the role of HBGAs in rotavirus infections in our population, secretor status (FUT2+), ABO blood group, and Lewis antigens were determined in children attended for rotavirus gastroenteritis in Valencia, Spain. During three consecutive years (2013-2015), stool and saliva samples were collected from 133 children with rotavirus infection. Infecting viral genotypes and HBGAs were determined in patients and compared to a control group and data from blood donors. Rotavirus G9P[8] was the most prevalent strain (49.6%), followed by G1P[8] (20.3%) and G12P[8] (14.3%). Rotavirus infected predominantly secretor (99%) and Lewis b positive (91.7%) children. Children with blood group A and AB were significantly more prone to rotavirus gastroenteritis than those with blood group O. Our results confirm that a HBGA genetic background is linked to rotavirus P[8] susceptibility. Rotavirus P[8] symptomatic infection is manifestly more frequent in secretor-positive (FUT2+) than in non-secretor individuals, although no differences between rotavirus G genotypes were found.",

Furthermore, emerging evidence exists that the microbiota is also of importance in brain function and development. Therefore, microbiota characterization has not only potential as a diagnostic or even preventive tool to predict NEC, but may also serve as a biomarker to monitor and possibly even as a target to manipulate brain development. Analysis of fecal volatile organic compounds, which shape the volatile metabolome and reflect microbiota function and host interaction, has been shown to be of interest in the diagnosis of NEC and late-onset sepsis.

The study aim was to examine the incidence and characteristics and norovirus gastroenteritis before and after the introduction of universal rotavirus immunization in Israel. We studied 1179 stool samples collected between November 2007 and December 2014 for a prospective hospital-based surveillance study of children aged 0-59 months hospitalized for gastroenteritis. A real-time RT-PCR assay was used to identify genogroup II (GII) norovirus in extracted fecal RNA samples. Overall, the weighted percentage of norovirus positive patients was 10.9%. Norovirus positivity was similar in the pre-universal rotavirus immunisation years (2008-2010) and the universal years (2011-2014), the respective average annual incidence of norovirus gastroenteritis was 1.6 (95% CI 0.6-2.3) per 1000 and 1.1 (95% CI 0.8-1.4) per 1000 children. Rotavirus was detected in 36.8% and 19.6% of the patients in the pre-vaccine years and the universal vaccine years, with an estimated incidence of 5.5 (95% CI 3.4-7.6) per 1000 and 2.1 (95% CI 1.6-2.7) per 1000 children, respectively. Most patients (59.1%) with norovirus gastroenteritis were infants aged 0-11 months. Norovirus was detected all year round with a significant 3-month peak from September through November. In conclusion, norovirus continues to be a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis associated with hospitalizations in young children. Future norovirus vaccines should target young infants.

Nucleic acid amplification testing of easier-to-collect stool samples could be a noninvasive method of diagnosing PTB. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of testing stool with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (\"stool Xpert\") for childhood PTB. Four databases were searched for publications from January 2008 to June 2018. Studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy among children of stool Xpert compared to a microbiological reference standard of conventional specimens tested by mycobacterial culture or Xpert were eligible. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity of stool Xpert against the reference standard. From 1,589 citations, 9 studies (n = 1,681) were included. Median participant ages ranged from 1.3 to 10.6 years. Protocols for stool processing and testing varied substantially, with differences in reagents and methods of homogenization and filtering. Against the microbiological reference standard, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of stool Xpert were 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52 to 79%) and 99% (95% CI, 98 to 99%), respectively. Sensitivity was higher among children with HIV (79% [95% CI, 68 to 87%] versus 60% [95% CI, 44 to 74%] among HIV-uninfected children). Heterogeneity was high. Data were insufficient for subgroup analyses among children under the age of 5 years, the most relevant target population.

			"abstract": "Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), which is the causative agent of botulism, a rare but serious disease that can result in death if not treated. Infant botulism occurs when C. botulinum colonizes the intestinal tract of infants and produces BoNT. It has been proposed that infants under the age of 1 year are uniquely susceptible to colonization by C. botulinum as their intestinal microbiota is not fully developed and provides little competition, allowing C. botulinum to thrive and produce BoNT in the gut. There are seven well-characterized serotypes (A-G) of BoNT identified by the ability of specific antitoxins to neutralize BoNTs. Molecular technology has allowed researchers to narrow these further into subtypes based on nucleic acid sequences of the botulinum toxin (bont) gene. One of the most recently recognized subtypes for bont/B is subtype bont/B7. We identified through whole genome sequencing five C. botulinum isolates harboring bont/B7 from CDC's strain collection, including patient isolates and an epidemiologically linked isolate from an opened infant formula container. In this study, we report the results of whole genome sequencing analysis of these C. botulinum subtype bont/B7 isolates. Average nucleotide identity and high quality single nucleotide polymorphism (hqSNP) analysis resulted in two major clades. The epidemiologically linked isolates differed from each other by 2-6 hqSNPs, and this clade separated from the other isolates by 95-119 hqSNPs, corroborating available epidemiological evidence.",

			"abstract": "Enteral feeding is a key component of care in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs); however, feeding tubes harbor microbes. These microbes have the potential to cause disease, yet their source remains controversial and clinical recommendations to reduce feeding tube colonization are lacking. This study aims to improve our understanding of the bacteria in neonatal feeding tubes and to evaluate factors that may affect these bacteria. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the bacteria present in pharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric portions of feeding tubes, residual fluid of the tubes, and infant stool using samples from 47 infants. Similar distributions of taxa were observed in all samples, although beta diversity differed by sample type. Feeding tube samples had lower alpha diversity than stool samples, and alpha diversity increased with gestational age, day of life, and tube dwell time. In a subset of samples from 6 infants analyzed by whole metagenome sequencing, there was greater overlap in transferable antimicrobial resistance genes between tube and fecal samples in breast milk fed infants than in formula fed infants. These findings develop our understanding of neonatal feeding tube colonization, laying a foundation for research into methods for minimizing NICU patients' exposure to antimicrobial resistant microbes.",

OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform an untargeted integrative analysis of the intestinal metabolome of childhood asthma in this ancillary study of the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial. METHODS: Metabolomic profiling was performed by using mass spectrometry on fecal samples collected from 361 three-year-old subjects. Adjusted logistic regression analyses identified metabolites and modules of highly correlated metabolites associated with asthma diagnosis by age 3 years. Sparse canonical correlation analysis identified associations relevant to asthma between the intestinal metabolome and other \"omics\": the intestinal microbiome as measured by using 16S rRNA sequencing, the plasma metabolome as measured by using mass spectrometry, and diet as measured by using food frequency questionnaires. RESULTS: Several intestinal metabolites were associated with asthma at age 3 years, including inverse associations between asthma and polyunsaturated fatty acids (adjusted logistic regression beta = -6.3; 95% CI, -11.3 to -1.4; P = .01) and other lipids. Asthma-associated intestinal metabolites were significant mediators of the inverse relationship between exclusive breast-feeding for the first 4 months of life and asthma (P for indirect association = .04) and the positive association between a diet rich in meats and asthma (P = .03). Specific intestinal bacterial taxa, including the family Christensenellaceae, and plasma metabolites, including gamma-tocopherol/beta-tocopherol, were positively associated with asthma and asthma-associated intestinal metabolites. CONCLUSION: Integrative analyses revealed significant interrelationships between the intestinal metabolome and the intestinal microbiome, plasma metabolome, and diet in association with childhood asthma.

Results showed that the meconium contained diversified microbiota, and greater pregnancy-related anxiety was significantly associated with a less diverse meconium microbiota community (p = 0.001). At the specific taxa level, greater pregnancy-related anxiety was correlated with a lower level of the Enterococcaceae family (p = 2e-4, Spearman rho = -0.43).

Moreover, the GM of patients compared to CTRLs showed a dysbiotic status characterised by an increase of Faecalibacterium, Oscillospira, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Sutterella and a reduction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (i.e., Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Coprococcus, Eubacterium and Propionibacterium).

We examined the incidence, clinical features and outcomes in the first week of life. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of culture-proven bacterial gastroenteritis in newborn infants that were diagnosed between January 2011 and September 2018 in a tertiary centre in Israel. RESULTS: There were 10 cases of culture-proven bacterial gastroenteritis, detected out of 91 stool cultures. All infants were born vaginally and nine were full-term infants. The annual incidence was 0.096 per 1000 live births. The responsible pathogen was Campylobacter in six patients, Salmonella in two and Shigella sonnei in two. The mean age of disease onset was two days of life. Antibiotics were given to five patients, but were inappropriate in two cases. Only one patient with the Shigella sonnei infection required respiratory support. All patients fully recovered. CONCLUSION: One in ten newborn infants with bloody stools had bacterial gastroenteritis, contradicting the low rates found in other studies and indicating the importance of considering this diagnosis. Antimicrobials active against Salmonella or Shigella should be given to newborn infants who have bloody stools and look ill.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: About 25% of women in the United States are obese prior to becoming pregnant. Although there is some knowledge about the relationship between the gastrointestinal microbiota and obesity, little is known about the relationship between pre-pregnancy obesity and the gastrointestinal microbiota in pregnancy or its impact on infant gut microbiota. However, the composition of the gut microbiota early in life may influence childhood health. Thus, the objective of this research was to identify associations between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and the pregnancy (n = 39) or early infancy (n = 39) microbiotas. RESULTS: Fecal bacterial communities from overweight women had lower microbiota diversity (Chao1: p = 0.02; inverse Simpson: p = 0.05; Shannon: p = 0.02) than communities from normal weight or obese women. The within-group microbiota composition of overweight women differed from those of normal and obese women at the genus and phylum levels (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02, respectively). Pre-pregnancy overweight women had higher abundances of Bacteroides and lower Phascolarctobacterium than women who were normal weight or obese prior to becoming pregnant. Normal weight women had lower abundances of Acidaminococcus and Dialister than overweight and obese women. Infant community composition tended to differ in membership (Sorensen index) by maternal pre-pregnancy BMI category, and significantly differed by delivery mode and breastfeeding exclusivity (p = 0.06, p = 0.001, p = 0.008, respectively). Infants from normal weight women had lower abundances of Megasphaera than infants from overweight or obese women. Streptococcus was lowest in infants from overweight women, and Staphylococcus was lowest in infants from obese women. CONCLUSION: Maternal and infant microbiotas are associated with and might be affected by maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Future work should determine if there are also functional differences in the infant microbiome, if those functional differences are related to maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and whether differences in composition or traits persist over time.",

This study sought to assess institutional variation in utilization of rectal biopsy in children with MPS and the likelihood of diagnosing HD in this population. METHODS: Patients with MPS on contrast enema in the first 30 days of life from the Pediatric Health Information System database in 2016-2017 were included. Institutional rates of rectal biopsies performed during the initial admission were calculated and then used to predict institutional rates of early HD diagnoses using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of 373 newborns with MPS, 106 (28.4%) underwent early rectal biopsy, of whom 43 (40.5%) had HD. Fifty-seven (15.3%) were ultimately diagnosed with HD. Eight (14%) of these patients had a delayed diagnosis. HD rates between institutions did not differ significantly (range 0-50%, p=0.52), but usage of early rectal biopsy did (range 0-80%, p=0.03). Each additional early biopsy increased the early HD diagnosis rate by 35% (beta=0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.45, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of HD is increased in children with MPS. There is significant hospital variability in the utilization of early rectal biopsy, and opportunity exists to standardize practice.

Rotavirus and norovirus are leading causes of acute diarrhea accounting for more than half of this burden. OBJECTIVE/STUDY DESIGN: To determine the prevalence and genotype distribution of acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus and astrovirus among children <5 years of age at two departments in Guatemala from January 2014 to December 2015, we tested 471 stool specimens (202 samples from hospitalized children and 269 samples from children in ambulatory clinics) by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and genotyped positive samples. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 20.4%, norovirus in 18.5%, sapovirus in 7% and astrovirus in 4.2% of the samples. Co-infection of rotavirus and norovirus was found in 2.6% of the samples. Most norovirus (87.4%) and rotavirus (81.3%) infections were detected in children in the 6-12 months age group. The proportion of patients with rotavirus (34%) and norovirus (23%) was higher in hospitalized patients compared to ambulatory patients, whereas the prevalence of sapovirus and astrovirus was similar in both settings. Of the 40 genotyped norovirus strains, 62.5% were GII.4 and 15% GII.3. Sapovirus genotypes included GI.1 (15.4%), GII.2 (15.4%), GII.5 (38.5%) and GIV.1 (30.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that in 2014-2015, gastroenteritis viruses account for 50% of acute diarrhea in children younger than 5 years of age in Guatemala, highlighting the importance of continuous surveillance to guide impact of the current rotavirus vaccine and formulation of future norovirus vaccines.",

Eight positive Entamoeba complex, as well as four Entamoeba complex-like isolates, were detected by microscopic stool examination. DNA was extracted from all positive and from 55 randomly selected negative stool samples. PCR was performed using species-specific 18S rRNA primers for the Entamoeba complex. All positive PCR samples were sequenced. In total, 14 (1.01%) out of 1383 isolates, i.e. 12 microscopy-positive and Entamoeba complex-like isolates and two out of 55 microscopy-negative isolates, were identified via PCR and sequencing. Overall, 0.58% (8/1383) of the isolates were E. dispar, 0.14% (2/1383) E. histolytica, 0.07% (1/1383) E. moshkovskii and 0.22% (3/1383) were mixed of E. histolytica and E. dispar. Based on our findings, the prevalence of E. dispar is greater than that of E. histoltyica. On the other hand, a case of E. moshkovskii was reported for the first time in this region.

Viruses were analyzed from stool samples collected monthly from infants participating in a prospective birth cohort study.

Data revealed significant inter-group differences between healthy and eczema samples in all age groups, and decreased microbial diversity was most significantly found in children with eczema of age 2-3 years old. Decreased abundance of Bifidobacterium was a major finding in eczema groups from 0.5-3 years compared to the age matched healthy controls, but not significant in children younger than 6 month old. Of note, Bifidobacterium operational taxonomic units were identified by Random Forest with highly predictive power of 0.83 (AUC = 0.83) in ROC analysis, which also confirmed its role as a key genus that is associated with eczema. To verify the sequencing results, we performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides in the same cohort, and in a new eczema cohort (N = 57) for validation. Significantly, lower Bifidobacterium quantities were found in both eczema groups with an age range of 0.5-3 years.

We aimed to determine whether MSAF exposure during labor carries a longer lasting impact on pediatric infectious morbidity. STUDY DESIGN: A population-based cohort analysis was performed including all singleton deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single tertiary medical center. Exposure was defined as the presence of MSAF during labor. Hospitalizations of the offspring up to the age of 18 years involving infectious diseases were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative morbidity and a Cox regression model to control for confounders. RESULTS: During the study period, 243 725 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 35 897 (14.7%) involved MSAF. Rate of infectious-related hospitalizations of the offspring was significantly lower in children exposed to MSAF as compared with the unexposed group (10.8% vs 11.1%, P < 0.05). Specifically, hospitalizations involving respiratory infections were significantly less common among the MSAF group (5.1% vs 5.6%, P < 0.001). The survival curve demonstrated significantly lower cumulative total infectious morbidity rates in the MSAF-exposed group (log rank P < 0.001). In the Cox model, controlled for maternal age, diabetes, hypertension, mode of delivery, and gestational age, exposed children exhibited lower rates of long-term childhood infectious morbidity (adjusted HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Fetal exposure to MSAF during labor and delivery appears to be associated with lower rates of long-term infectious-related hospitalizations in the offspring.",

Environmental toxicants can contaminate breast milk and the developing infant gut microbiome is directly exposed. We investigated whether environmental toxicants in breastmilk affect the composition and function of the infant gut microbiome at 1 month. We measured environmental toxicants in breastmilk, fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut microbial composition from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using samples from 267 mother-child pairs in the Norwegian Microbiota Cohort (NoMIC). We tested 28 chemical exposures: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated flame retardants (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and organochlorine pesticides. We assessed chemical exposure and alpha diversity/SCFAs using elastic net regression modeling and generalized linear models, adjusting for confounders, and variation in beta diversity (UniFrac), taxa abundance (ANCOM), and predicted metagenomes (PiCRUSt) in low, medium, and high exposed groups. RESULTS: PBDE-28 and the surfactant perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were associated with less microbiome diversity. Some sub-OTUs of Lactobacillus, an important genus in early life, were lower in abundance in samples from infants with relative \"high\" (> 80th percentile) vs. \"low\" (< 20th percentile) toxicant exposure in this cohort. Moreover, breast milk toxicants were associated with microbiome functionality, explaining up to 34% of variance in acetic and propionic SCFAs, essential signaling molecules. Per one standard deviation of exposure, PBDE-28 was associated with less propionic acid (- 24% [95% CI - 35% to - 14%] relative to the mean), and PCB-209 with less acetic acid (- 15% [95% CI - 29% to - 0.4%]). Conversely, PFOA and dioxin-like PCB-167 were associated with 61% (95% CI 35% to 87%) and 22% (95% CI 8% to 35%) more propionic and acetic acid, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental toxicant exposure may influence infant gut microbial function during a critical developmental window. Future studies are needed to replicate these novel findings and investigate whether this has any impact on child health.",

			"abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota composition differs between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Today's infant formulas are often fortified with prebiotics to better mimic properties of human milk with respect to its effect on GI microbiota composition and function. We used Illumina HiSeq sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments to investigate the composition of faecal microbiota in 2-12 week old infants receiving either breastmilk, infant formulas fortified with prebiotics, or mixed feeding. We compared these results with results from infants fed traditional formulas used in the Netherlands in 2002-2003, which contained no added prebiotics. We showed that today's formulas supplemented with either scGOS (0.24-0.50 g/100 ml) or scGOS and lcFOS (at a 9:1 ratio; total 0.6 g/100 ml) had a strong bifidogenic effect as compared to traditional formulas, and they also resulted in altered patterns of microbial colonisation within the developing infant gastrointestinal tract. We identified three microbial states (or developmental stages) in the first 12 weeks of life, with a gradual transition pattern towards a bifidobacteria dominated state. In infants receiving only fortified formulas, this transition towards the bifidobacteria dominated state was accelerated, whereas in infants receiving mixed feeding the transition was delayed, as compared to exclusively breastfed infants.",

			"article_name": "Unexpected term NICU admissions: a marker of obstetrical care quality?",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unexpected admissions of term neonates to the neonatal intensive care unit and unexpected postnatal complications have been proposed as neonatal-focused quality metrics for intrapartum care. Previous studies have noted significant variation in overall hospital neonatal intensive care unit admission rates; however, little is known about the influence of obstetric practices on these rates or whether variation among unanticipated admissions in low-risk, term neonates can be attributed to systemic hospital practices. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the relative effects of patient characteristics and intrapartum events on unexpected neonatal intensive care unit admissions and to quantify the between-hospital variation in neonatal intensive care unit admission rates among this group of neonates. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study using data collected as part of the Consortium for Safe Labor study. Women who delivered term (>/=37 weeks), singleton, nonanomalous, liveborn infants without an a priori risk for neonatal intensive care unit admission were included. The primary outcome was neonatal intensive care unit admission among this population. Multilevel mixed-effect models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for demographics (age, race, insurer), pregnancy characteristics (parity, gestational age, tobacco use, birthweight), maternal comorbidities (chronic and pregnancy-induced hypertension), hospital characteristics (delivery volume, hospital and neonatal intensive care unit level, academic affiliation), and intrapartum events (prolonged second stage, induction of labor, trial of labor after cesarean delivery, chorioamnionitis, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and abruption). Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to estimate the between-hospital variance in a series of hierarchical models. RESULTS: Of the 143,951 infants meeting all patient and hospital inclusion criteria, 7995 (5.6%) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit after birth. In the fully adjusted model, the factors associated with the highest odds for neonatal intensive care unit admission included: nulliparity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.62 [95% confidence interval, 1.53-1.71]), large for gestational age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [95% confidence interval, 1.47-1.71]), and small for gestational age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.47-1.73]). Induction of labor (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.01]) was not associated with increased odds of neonatal intensive care unit admission compared with women who labored spontaneously. The events associated with higher odds of neonatal intensive care unit admission included: prolonged second stage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66 [95% confidence interval, 1.51-1.83]); chorioamnionitis (adjusted odds ratio, 3.89 [95% confidence interval, 3.42-4.44]), meconium-stained amniotic fluid (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96 [95% confidence interval, 1.82-2.10]), and abruption (adjusted odds ratio, 2.64 [95% confidence interval, 2.16-.21]). Compared with women who did not labor, the odds of neonatal intensive care unit admission were lower for women who labored: adjusted odds ratio, 0.48 (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.52) for women with no uterine scar and adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.94) for women with a uterine scar. There was significant variation in neonatal intensive care unit admission rates by hospital, ranging from 2.9% to 11.2%. After accounting for case mix and hospital characteristics, the between-hospital variance was 1.9%, suggesting that little of the variation was explained by the effect of the hospital. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the currently limited understanding of term, neonatal intensive care unit admission rates as a marker of obstetrical care quality. We demonstrated that significant variation exists in hospital unexpected neonatal intensive care unit admission rates and that certain intrapartum events are associated with an increased risk for neonatal intensive care unit admission after delivery. However, the between-hospital variation was low. Unmeasured confounders and extrinsic factors, such as neonatal intensive care unit bed availability, may limit the ability of unexpected term neonatal intensive care unit admissions to meaningfully reflect obstetrical care quality.",

Here, we investigated PN C. difficile carriage and colonization dynamics, analyzed the impact of perinatal determinants on colonization, and characterized the isolates. METHODS: A one year longitudinal monocentric prospective cohort study was performed on 121 PN. C. difficile strains isolated from fecal samples on selective medium were identified and characterized by PCR (tpi housekeeping gene; tcdA and tcdB, and binary toxin genes), capillary gel-based electrophoresis PCR-ribotyping, and Multi-Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat Analysis (MLVA). RESULTS: Of the 379 samples analyzed, 199 (52%) were C. difficile culture positive with the mean levels of C. difficile colonization decreasing significantly (P = .027) over time. During hospitalization, C. difficile colonization frequency increased up to 61% with 95% of the strains belonging to both non-toxigenic PCR-ribotypes (RTs) FR082 (35%) and 032 (60%). After hospital discharge, if a higher diversity in RTs was observed, RTs FR082 and 032 remained predominant (respectively 40% and 28%). MLVA showed clonal relationship within each FR082 and 032 RTs. Ten toxigenic strains (5%) were isolated, all tcdA+/tcdB+ except for one tcdA-/tcdB+, and all being acquired after hospitalization. At 1 week, the only factors found to be linked with a higher frequency of C. difficile colonization were a higher gestational age (P = 0.006) and a higher birth weight (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: The dynamics of C. difficile colonization in PN followed a specific pattern. C. difficile colonization rapidly occurred after birth with a low diversity of non-toxigenic RTs. After hospitalization, non-toxigenic RTs diversity increased. Sporadic carriage of toxigenic strains was observed after hospitalization.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cancer diagnosis during pregnancy occurs in 1 out of 1000 pregnancies with common malignancies including breast and hematological cancers. Fetal exposure to currently utilized agents is poorly described. We directly assessed fetal exposure by screening meconium from 23 newborns whose mothers had undergone treatment for cancer during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Meconium was collected from newborns whose mothers were diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy and underwent chemotherapy in the second or third trimester as part of the Cancer and Pregnancy Registry. We conducted screening of 23 meconium samples for chemotherapeutics and known metabolites of chemotherapeutics by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Putative identification of paclitaxel and/or its metabolites was made in 8 screened samples. In positively screened samples, we quantified paclitaxel, 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel by stable isotope dilution-LC-HRMS. RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) levels of paclitaxel in positively screened samples were 399.9 (248.6) pg/mg in meconium samples from newborn born to mothers that underwent chemotherapy during pregnancy. 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel mean levels were 105.2 (54.6) and 113.4 (48.9) pg/mg meconium, respectively. CONCLUSION: Intact paclitaxel, 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel were detected in meconium, providing unambiguous confirmation of human fetal exposure. Variability in meconium levels between individuals may indicate a potential for reducing fetal exposure based on timing, dosing, and individual characteristics. This preliminary study may provide an approach for examining the effects of cancer diagnosis during pregnancy on other outcomes by providing a measure of direct fetal exposure.",

			"article_name": "The effect of intestinal flora on the neural development of severe hyperbilirubinemia neonates.",
			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of intestinal flora on the neural development of severe hyperbilirubinemia neonates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 108 severe hyperbilirubinemia neonates admitted to the Dezhou People's Hospital from January 2015 through January 2018 were analyzed, and all newborns had a serum total bilirubin level > 342 mumol/L. Based on whether they suffered from neural development abnormalities, the neonatal patients were divided into the neural abnormality group (n=52) and the non-neural abnormality group (n=56). The unconjugated bilirubin levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the composition of intestinal flora were compared. RESULTS: Among 108 neonates, there were 55 cases with developmental abnormalities, in which 52 (48.13%) cases had neural developmental abnormalities, mainly epileptic patients. The serum and CSF unconjugated bilirubin levels of the neonatal patients in the neural abnormality group were (466.25+/-97.64) mumol/L and (9.64+/-2.98) mumol/L, respectively, which were higher than those in neonatal patients of the non-neural abnormality group [(357.89+/-72.53) mumol/L and (6.73+/-3.11) mumol/L], with statistically significant differences (p<0.05). The abundance of intestinal flora genus in the neonates in the neural abnormality group was lower than that in the non-neural abnormality group, and the comparisons of Fusobacterium, Catabacter, Succinivibrio, Clostridium and Bacteroides between the two groups showed statistically significant differences (p<0.05). DISCUSSION: The intestinal micro-ecological environment of newborns was vulnerable and easily affected by many factors such as methods of delivery, feeding ways and eating habits of their mothers. This study investigated the effects of intestinal flora on the neural development of neonates with severe hyperbilirubinemia. The results showed that, due to decreased intestinal flora diversity, the serum and cerebrospinal fluid bilirubin levels were elevated, and the abnormal rate of neural development was increased. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hyperbilirubinemia neonates with neural abnormalities have decreased diversity of intestinal flora genus and relatively high serum and CSF bilirubin levels, probably because the decrease in the diversity of intestinal flora genus leads to the change of the blood-CSF barrier permeability, leading to raised levels of bilirubin in serum and CSF, thus affecting the neural development of neonatal patients.",

			"article_name": "Genome-resolved metagenomics of eukaryotic populations during early colonization of premature infants and in hospital rooms.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fungal infections are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized preterm infants, yet little is known about eukaryotic colonization of infants and of the neonatal intensive care unit as a possible source of colonizing strains. This is partly because microbiome studies often utilize bacterial 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing, a technique that is blind to eukaryotic organisms. Knowledge gaps exist regarding the phylogeny and microdiversity of eukaryotes that colonize hospitalized infants, as well as potential reservoirs of eukaryotes in the hospital room built environment. RESULTS: Genome-resolved analysis of 1174 time-series fecal metagenomes from 161 premature infants revealed fungal colonization of 10 infants. Relative abundance levels reached as high as 97% and were significantly higher in the first weeks of life (p = 0.004). When fungal colonization occurred, multiple species were present more often than expected by random chance (p = 0.008). Twenty-four metagenomic samples were analyzed from hospital rooms of six different infants. Compared to floor and surface samples, hospital sinks hosted diverse and highly variable communities containing genomically novel species, including from Diptera (fly) and Rhabditida (worm) for which genomes were assembled. With the exception of Diptera and two other organisms, zygosity of the newly assembled diploid eukaryote genomes was low. Interestingly, Malassezia and Candida species were present in both room and infant gut samples. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of fungal co-colonization may reflect synergistic interactions or differences in infant susceptibility to fungal colonization. Discovery of eukaryotic organisms that have not been sequenced previously highlights the benefit of genome-resolved analyses, and low zygosity of assembled genomes could reflect inbreeding or strong selection imposed by room conditions.",

To confirm the specific impact of Clostridium butyricum in this pathology, selective culture procedure was used for Clostridia isolation. Whole-genome analysis was employed to investigate genomic relationships between isolates. Stool samples from present study, as well as from previously investigated cases, were implicated including 88 from preterm neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis and 71 from matched controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the presence of C. butyricum from stools of new cases. Clostridium species prevalence isolated by culture was compared between patients with necrotizing enterocolitis and controls. By combining results of both culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods, C. butyricum was significantly more frequent in stool samples from preterm neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis than in controls. Whole-genome analysis of 81 genomes including 58 neonates' isolates revealed that cases were clustered depending on geographical origin of isolation. Controls isolates presented genomic relations with that of patients suggesting a mechanism of asymptomatic carriage. Overall, this suggests an epidemiology comparable to that observed in Clostridium difficile colitis in adults.",

We investigated hospitalizations with diarrhea during pre and post-vaccination periods among children aged 0-5\u202fyears in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of hospital admission registries from November 1st 2012 through October 31th 2017 at all referral hospitals in Nouakchott. We described admissions of children aged 0-5\u202fyears by diagnosis, data of admission, age and sex, and compared the proportion of all childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction. RESULTS: In total, 6552 (19%) of all 34,329 hospitalizations in 0-5\u202fyear-olds had diarrhea. Of these, 3523/16,952 (20.7%) were recorded during the pre-vaccine period, 1373/6897 (19.9%) during the transition period (November 2014-October 2015), and 1656/10,480 (15.8%) during the post-vaccination period. The proportion of all childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea during the pre-vaccine period was 22.6% among males and 18.7% among females. Approximately one third (32.3%) of hospitalizations with diarrhea occurred in children aged 6-11\u202fmonths. During the post-vaccination period, the proportion of hospitalizations with diarrhea declined by 24%, and the highest reduction (74%) was observed in children aged 2 to 5\u202fyears (P\u202f<\u202f0.001).

In this study, we assessed the presence of AGE in household contacts (HHCs) of pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed rotavirus. METHODS: Between December 2011 and June 2016, children aged 14 days to 11 years with AGE were enrolled at 1 of 7 hospitals or emergency departments as part of the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. Parental interviews, medical and vaccination records, and stool specimens were collected at enrollment. Stool was tested for rotavirus by an enzyme immunoassay and confirmed by real-time or conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay or repeated enzyme immunoassay. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted to assess AGE in HHCs the week after the enrolled child's illness. A mixed-effects multivariate model was used to calculate odds ratios. RESULTS: Overall, 829 rotavirus-positive subjects and 8858 rotavirus-negative subjects were enrolled. Households of rotavirus-positive subjects were more likely to report AGE illness in >/=1 HHC than were rotavirus-negative households (35% vs 20%, respectively; P < .0001). A total of 466 (16%) HHCs of rotavirus-positive subjects reported AGE illness. Of the 466 ill HHCs, 107 (23%) sought healthcare; 6 (6%) of these encounters resulted in hospitalization. HHCs who were <5 years old (odds ratio, 2.2 [P = .004]) were more likely to report AGE illness than those in other age groups. In addition, 144 households reported out-of-pocket expenses (median, $20; range, $2-$640) necessary to care for an ill HHC. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus-associated AGE in children can lead to significant disease burden in HHCs, especially in children aged <5 years. Prevention of pediatric rotavirus illness, notably through vaccination, can prevent additional illnesses in HHCs.",

			"abstract": "Viral agents of human gastroenteritis affect people of all ages across the globe. As a mainly self-limiting disease, it is difficult to evaluate the real prevalence of etiological agents circulating in each region. Many of the analyzed outbreaks are caused by viruses of the family Caliciviridae, especially the genus Norovirus (NoV). Most studies have focused on other enteric viruses, leaving sapovirus (SaV) underestimated as an important emerging human threat. This one-year study analyzed clinical samples from hospital outpatients with acute gastroenteritis in Spain, with the aim of revealing the importance of human SaV as an emerging viral pathogen. A total of 2667 stools were tested using reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR to detect and quantify SaV. Sapovirus was detected in all age groups, especially in infants, children, and the elderly. The prevalence was 15.64% (417/2667), and was slightly higher in 0(-)2- and 3(-)5-year-olds (19.53% and 17.95%, respectively) and much lower in 13(-)18-year-olds (9.86%). Positive samples were detected throughout the year, with peaks of detection during autumn and the late winter to early spring months. The mean value for the quantified samples was 6.5 x 10(5) genome copies per gram of stool (GC/g) (range 2.4 x 10(3)(-)6.6 x 10(11) GC/g). RT-nested PCR and sequencing were used for further genotyping. Genetic characterization showed a predominance of genogroup I (GI), followed by GII and GIV. The detection of multiple genotypes suggests the circulation of different strains without any clear tendency. The results obtained suggest SaV as the second major gastroenteritis agent after NoV in the region.",

Zero-inflated beta regression model with random effects was used to assess the impact of stress on gut microbiome trajectories. Week of sampling was significant for Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Proteus, Streptococcus, Clostridium butyricum, and Clostridium perfringens. Antibiotic usage was significant for Proteus, Citrobacter, and C. perfringens. Gender was significant for Proteus. Stress exposure occurring 1 and 2 weeks prior to sampling had a significant effect on Proteus and Veillonella. NICU stress exposure had a significant effect on Proteus and Veillonella. An overall dominance of Gammaproteobacteria was found.

			"abstract": "Diarrhea remains one of the most common causes of deaths in children. A limited number of studies have investigated the prevalence of enteric pathogens in Cameroon, and as in many other African countries, the cause of many diarrheal episodes remains unexplained. A proportion of these unknown cases of diarrhea are likely caused by yet-unidentified viral agents, some of which could be the result of (recent) interspecies transmission from animal reservoirs, like bats. Using viral metagenomics, we screened fecal samples of 221 humans (almost all with gastroenteritis symptoms) between 0 and 89 years of age with different degrees of bat contact. We identified viruses belonging to families that are known to cause gastroenteritis such as Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae Interestingly, a mammalian orthoreovirus, picobirnaviruses, a smacovirus, and a pecovirus were also found. Although there was no evidence of interspecies transmission of the most common human gastroenteritis-related viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, and Reoviridae), the phylogenies of the identified orthoreovirus, picobirnavirus, and smacovirus indicate a genetic relatedness of these viruses identified in stools of humans and those of bats and/or other animals. These findings points out the possibility of interspecies transmission or simply a shared host of these viruses (bacterial, fungal, parasitic, ...) present in both animals (bats) and humans. Further screening of bat viruses in humans or vice versa will elucidate the epidemiological potential threats of animal viruses to human health. Furthermore, this study showed a huge diversity of highly divergent novel phages, thereby expanding the existing phageome considerably.IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of diagnostic tools for different enteric viral pathogens, a large fraction of human cases of gastroenteritis remains unexplained. This could be due to pathogens not tested for or novel divergent viruses of potential animal origin. Fecal virome analyses of Cameroonians showed a very diverse group of viruses, some of which are genetically related to those identified in animals. This is the first attempt to describe the gut virome of humans from Cameroon. Therefore, the data represent a baseline for future studies on enteric viral pathogens in this area and contribute to our knowledge of the world's virome. The studies also highlight the fact that more viruses may be associated with diarrhea than the typical known ones. Hence, it provides meaningful epidemiological information on diarrhea-related viruses in this area.",

			"abstract": "Numerous studies have reported bacterial DNA in first-pass meconium samples, suggesting that the human gut microbiome is seeded prior to birth. However, these studies have not been able to discriminate between DNA from living bacterial cells, DNA from dead bacterial cells or cell-free DNA. Here we have used propidium monoazide (PMA) together with 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine whether there are intact bacterial cells in the fetal gut. DNA was extracted from first-pass meconium (n = 5) and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing with/without PMA treatment. All meconium samples, regardless of PMA treatment, contained detectable levels of bacterial DNA; however, treatment with PMA prior to DNA extraction decreased the DNA yield by approximately 20%. PMA-treated meconium samples did not differ significantly from untreated samples in terms of observed number of OTUs (P = 0.945); although they did differ taxonomically, with around one quarter of OTUs identified in untreated samples only, suggesting that they have originated from cell-free/nonviable DNA. The mean Sorensen coefficient for treated vs untreated samples was 0.527. Our findings suggest that the fetal gut is seeded with intact bacterial cells prior to birth. This is an important finding, as exposure to live bacteria during gestation might have a significant impact on the developing fetus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: DNA-based microbiome studies performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing are limited by their inability to discriminate between live bacterial cells, dead bacterial cells and cell-free DNA. Here we use propidium monoazide (PMA) to exclude nonviable bacteria from microbiome analysis of first-pass meconium samples and thereby reveal that the majority of the purported fetal gut microbiome is from intact bacterial cells. This work demonstrates the importance of excluding nonviable bacteria when analysing the microbial community in low-biomass samples such as meconium.",

			"article_name": "Prevalence of Clostridium difficile infections among Kenyan children with diarrhea.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrhea causes significant morbidity and mortality among children worldwide. Regions most affected by diarrhea include Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where antibiotics are in common use and can make children more vulnerable to Clostridium difficile and pathogens that are not affected by these drugs. Indeed, C. difficile is a major diarrhea-associated pathogen and poses a significant threat to vulnerable and immunocompromised populations. Yet, little is known about the role and epidemiology of C. difficile in diarrhea-associated illness among young children. As a result, C. difficile is often neglected in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa that are most impacted by childhood diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to establish the frequency of C. difficile in young children (<5 years) with diarrhea. METHODS: Children presenting with diarrhea at a national hospital in Kenya from 2015 to 2018 were enrolled consecutively. Following informed consent by a parent or legal guardian, stool samples were obtained from the children and demographic data were collected. The stools were examined for the presence of four common pathogens known to cause diarrhea: C. difficile, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia lamblia. C. difficile was verified by toxigenic culture and PCR. The presence of C. parvum and/or G. lamblia was determined using the ImmunoCard STAT! Crypto/Giardia Rapid assay. Rotavirus was detected by ELISA. RESULTS: The study population comprised 157 children; 62.4% were male and 37.6% were female and their average age was 12.4 months. Of the 157 stool specimens investigated, 37.6% were positive for C. difficile, 33.8% for rotavirus, 5.1% for Cryptosporidium, and 5.1% for Giardia. PCR analysis identified at least one of the C. difficile-specific - genes (tcdA, tcdB, or tcdC). Further, 57.6% of the stools had C. difficile colonies bearing a frame-shift deletion in the tcdC gene, a mutation associated with increased toxin production. The frequency of C. difficile was 32.6% in children </=12 months old and increased to 46.6% in children 12-24 months old. CONCLUSIONS: In Kenyan children presenting with diarrhea, C. difficile is more prevalent than rotavirus or Cryptosporidium, two leading causes of childhood diarrhea. These findings underscore the need to better understand the role of C. difficile in children with diarrhea, especially in areas with antibiotic overuse. Understanding C. difficile epidemiology and its relationship to co-infecting pathogens among African children with diarrhea will help in devising ways of reducing diarrhea-associated illness.",

The analysis of meconium, the first bowel discharge of the newborn, has been proposed as a non-invasive way to assess cumulative prenatal exposure. The aim of this study was to implement an analytical method for quantifying 72 targeted organic compounds, including pesticides, pharmaceutical compounds and daily life xenobiotics, in meconium in addition to selected elements (17 elements). We report initial monitoring results based on the analysis of 396 meconium samples from an Eastern Canada cohort (Quebec, Canada). Element contents in meconium were analysed by mass spectrometry after digestion in nitric acid and peroxide. Targeted organic compounds were extracted and purified from meconium samples by a solid-liquid extraction followed by a dispersive-SPE purification before tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Concentrations of targeted elements were within the range of concentration reported in European and US studies but were lower than concentrations found in a developing country cohort (i.e., Pb, Cd). Out of the 72 targeted organic compounds, 31 were detected at least once and 30 were quantified. Compounds with the highest frequency of detection were caffeine, detected in all samples (from 2.80 to 6186\u202fng\u202fg(-1)), followed by acetaminophen detected in 53% of the samples (up to ~402\u202fmicrog\u202fg(-1)) and methyl paraben detected in 20% of the samples (up to ~10\u202fmicrog\u202fg(-1)). Pesticides were detected in low frequencies (< 2%) and low concentration (< 35\u202fng\u202fg(-1)). Results show that meconium can be used to monitor prenatal exposure of foetus to a wide array of inorganic and organic contaminants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stool consistency is an important diagnostic criterion in both research and clinical medicine and is often used to define diarrheal disease. METHODS: We examine the pediatric enteric virome across stool consistencies to evaluate differences in richness and community composition using fecal samples collected from children aged 0 to 5 years participating in a clinical trial in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The consistency of each sample was graded according to the modified Bristol Stool Form Scale for children (mBSFS-C) before a portion of stool was preserved for viral metagenomic analysis. Stool samples were grouped into 29 pools according to stool consistency type. Differential abundance was determined using negative-binomial modeling. RESULTS: Of 446 censused children who were eligible to participate, 317 presented for the study visit examination and 269 provided stool samples. The median age of children with stool samples was 36 months. Species richness was highest in watery-consistency stool and decreased as stool consistency became firmer (Spearman's r = - 0.45, p = 0.013). The greatest differential abundance comparing loose or watery to formed stool was for norovirus GII (7.64, 95% CI 5.8, 9.5) followed by aichivirus A (5.93, 95% CI 4.0, 7.89) and adeno-associated virus 2 (5.81, 95%CI 3.9, 7.7).

In all children, FFC (%) and FFE (g/day) were assessed in 3-day stool collection. RESULTS: FFC correlated with age (r = -0.50, P < 0.0001). Of infants aged 1 to 3 months 65% had FFC higher than the <5% norm proposed for older children. The values of 90th/95th FFC percentile ranged from 9.7/13.0% at 1 month to 3.1/3.2% at 24 months. FFE did not differ between age groups. It was, however, higher than 4 and 3 g/day in 7.5% and 15.0% infants, respectively. The first detailed nomogram for the assessment of FFC and FFE in children aged 1 to 24 months was created. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy infants may have higher FFC and FFE than older children.

METHODS: Children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) (>/=3 loose stools and/or >/= 1 episode of unexplained vomiting followed by loose stool within a 24-h period), hospitalized in Siaya County Referral Hospital (SCRH) from January 2010 through December 2013 were enrolled. Stool specimens were tested for rotavirus (RV) using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Hospitalization rates were calculated using person-years of observation (PYO) from the Health Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) as a denominator, while adjusting for healthcare utilization at household level and proportion of stool specimen collected from patients who met the case definition at the surveillance hospital. Mortality rates were calculated using PYO as the denominator and number of deaths estimated using total deaths in the HDSS, proportion of deaths attributed to diarrhoea by verbal autopsy (VA) and percent positive for rotavirus AGE (RVAGE) hospitalizations. RESULTS: Of 7760 all-cause hospitalizations among children < 5 years of age, 3793 (49%) were included in the analysis. Of these, 21% (805) had AGE; RV was detected in 143 (26%) of 541 stools tested. Among children < 5 years, the estimated hospitalization rates per 100,000 PYO for AGE and RVAGE were 2413 and 429, respectively.

We investigated the relationship between increasing fecal Gammaproteobacteria and mucosal inflammation, measured by fecal calprotectin (FC). METHODS: Stool samples were collected from very-low-birth weight (VLBW) infants at </=2, 3, and 4 weeks' postnatal age. Fecal microbiome was surveyed using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA, and FC was measured by enzyme immunoassay.

Klebsiella colonized the gut in two distinct patterns: some infants started with low Klebsiella abundance and gained these bacteria over time, whereas others began with very high Klebsiella abundance. CONCLUSION: In premature infants, FC correlated with relative abundance of a specific pathobiont, Klebsiella, and not with that of the class Gammaproteobacteria.

However, the true burden of the disease in general practice is unknown in France. Our objective was to determine the incidence of toxigenic C. difficile carriage and the percentage of stool samples prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) which contained free C. difficile toxins. METHODS: During an 11-month period, all stool samples submitted for any enteric pathogen detection to 15 different private laboratories in Paris and the surrounding areas were tested for C. difficile, irrespective of the GPs' request. A clinical questionnaire was completed for each patient. Stool samples were screened using a rapid simultaneous glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A/B detection test: any positive result (glutamate dehydrogenase or toxin) was further confirmed by the stool cytotoxicity assay (CTA) on MRC-5 cells and by toxigenic culture (TC) at a central laboratory. The C. difficile isolates were characterized by PCR ribotyping. RESULTS: A total of 2541 patients (1295 female, 1246 male) were included. The incidences of patients with a positive toxigenic culture and a positive CTA were 3.27% (95% CI 2.61%-4.03%) and 1.81% (95% CI 1.33%-2.41%), respectively. GPs requested C. difficile testing in only 12.93% of the stool samples, detecting 52.30% of all TC-positive patients. The 83 toxigenic C. difficile strains belonged to 36 different PCR ribotypes.

Understanding of the occurrence and genetic diversity of these viruses can help to prevent infections. OBJECTIVES: The present study describes the presence, genetic diversity and possible recombination of five enteric viruses in children with gastroenteritis in Southwestern Nigeria. STUDY DESIGN: From August 2012 to December 2013, stool samples and sociodemographic data of 103 diarrheic children <5 years were collected to detect and characterize rotavirus A, norovirus, human astrovirus, aichivirus and sapovirus using PCR techniques followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: At least one virus was identified in 58.3% (60/103) of the stool samples. Rotavirus, norovirus and astrovirus were detected in 39.8% (41/103), 10.7% (11/103), and 6.8% (7/103) respectively. Notably, aichivirus was detected for the first time in Nigeria (1/103; 0.97%). Sapovirus was not detected in the study. Co-infections with rotavirus were observed in eight samples either with norovirus or astrovirus or aichivirus. Phylogenetic analyses of different genome regions of norovirus positive samples provided indication for recombinant norovirus strains. A novel astrovirus strain closely related to canine astrovirus was identified and further characterized for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Viruses are the common cause of acute gastroenteritis in Nigerian infants with rotavirus as most frequently detected pathogen. New norovirus recombinants and a not yet detected zoonotic astrovirus were circulating in Southwestern Nigeria, providing new information about emerging and unusual strains of viruses causing diarrhea.",

Despite this, measures of clustering, such as within-group correlation or between-group heterogeneity, are rarely reported from community-based studies of NTD risk. We describe a general contextual analysis that uses multi-level models to partition and quantify variation in individual NTD risk at multiple grouping levels in rural Kenya. The importance of general contextual effects (GCE) in structuring variation in individual infection with Schistosoma mansoni, the soil-transmitted helminths, Taenia species, and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar was examined at the household-, sublocation- and constituency-levels using variance partition/intra-class correlation co-efficients and median odds ratios. These were compared with GCE for HIV, Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The role of place of residence in shaping infection risk was further assessed using the spatial scan statistic. Individuals from the same household showed correlation in infection for all pathogens, and this was consistently highest for the gastrointestinal helminths. The lowest levels of household clustering were observed for E. histolytica/dispar, P. falciparum and M. tuberculosis. Substantial heterogeneity in individual infection risk was observed between sublocations for S. mansoni and Taenia solium cysticercosis and between constituencies for infection with S. mansoni, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides. Large overlapping spatial clusters were detected for S. mansoni, T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides, and Taenia spp., which overlapped a large cluster of elevated HIV risk. Important place-based heterogeneities in infection risk exist in this community, and these GCEs are greater for the NTDs and HIV than for TB and malaria. Our findings suggest that broad-scale contextual drivers shape infectious disease risk in this population, but these effects operate at different grouping-levels for different pathogens. A general contextual analysis can provide a foundation for understanding the complex ecology of NTDs and contribute to the targeting of interventions.",

Both mothers (from 35 weeks gestation until 6 months post-partum if breastfeeding) and infants (from birth to 2 years) received either a placebo or one of two probiotics, L. rhamnosus HN001 (6x10(9) cfu), or B. animalis subsp. lactis HN019 (9x10(9) cfu). L. rhamnosus HN001 probiotic supplementation was associated with increased overall glycerol-3 phosphate transport capacity and enrichment of L. rhamnosus. There were no other significant changes in infant gut microbiota composition or diversity. Increased capacity to transport glycerol-3-phosphate was positively correlated with relative abundance of L. rhamnosus. Children who developed eczema had gut microbiota with increased capacity for glycosaminoglycan degradation and flagellum assembly but had no significant differences in microbiota composition or diversity. Early life HN001 probiotic use is associated with both increased L. rhamnosus and increased infant gut microbiota functional capacity to transport glycerol-3 phosphate. The mechanistic relationship of such functional alteration in gut microbiota with reduced eczema risk and long-term health merits further investigation.",

			"abstract": "Norovirus is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among children in developing countries. Limited data on the prevalence and genetic variability of norovirus are available in Cameroon, where early childhood mortality due to AGE is common. We tested 902 fecal specimens from children younger than 5 years of age hospitalized with AGE between January 2010 and December 2013. Overall, 76 (8.4%) samples tested positive for norovirus, of which 83% (63/76) were among children below 12 months old. Most of the noroviruses detected were in children infected between July and December of each year. All norovirus-positive specimens were genotyped, with 80% (61/76) being GII.4 (three variants detected). Genotypes GI.2, GI.6, GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.6, GII.16, GII.17, and GII.21 were also detected. Interestingly, GII.4 Sydney and GII.17 Kawasaki viruses were found as early as 2010, years before their emergence globally. This study suggests norovirus is a significant cause of moderate to severe gastroenteritis among young children in Cameroon. The results are important to highlight appropriate prevention and control strategies for reducing the burden of norovirus disease.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to (i) determine risk factors for enteropathogen co-infections, (ii) determine whether enteropathogen co-infections influence gastroenteritis risk, and (iii) determine whether enteropathogen co-infection occurred randomly in preschool children. METHODS: A monthly-repeated cross-sectional survey in Dutch children aged 0-48 months was conducted during October 2012 to October 2014. A total of 981 stool samples were collected along with questionnaires collecting data on gastrointestinal symptoms and potential risk factors; 822 samples were successfully tested for 19 enteropathogens using real-time multiplex PCRs. Logistic regression analysis assessed co-infections in relation to gastroenteritis and potential risk factors. RESULTS: In all, 598/822 (72.7%) stool samples tested positive for at least one enteropathogen, of which 290 (48.5%) were positive for two or more enteropathogens. Risk factors for two or more enteropathogen co-infections were young age (<12 months, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3; 13-36 months, OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5, versus 37-48 months), day-care attendance (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.5), households with three or more children versus those with one child (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8). Stool samples collected in spring less often had two or more enteropathogens versus summer (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.7). Food allergy was a risk factor for three or more enteropathogen co-infections (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-8.9). The frequency of co-infection was higher than expected for norovirus GI/norovirus GII, Clostridium difficile/norovirus GI, C. difficile/rotavirus, astrovirus/Dientamoeba fragilis, atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli/adenovirus, typical enteropathogenic E. coli/adenovirus, and enteroaggregative E. coli/astrovirus. No co-infection was associated with increased gastroenteritis risk. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for enteropathogen co-infections were identified and specific enteropathogens co-occurred significantly more often than expected by chance. Enteropathogen co-infections were not associated with increased gastroenteritis risk, calling into question their clinical relevance in preschool children.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although fetal alcohol spectrum disorders represent a significant public health problem, Native Americans are underrepresented in population and targeted screening programs. Prior reports suggest that Native American tribal communities may have a higher prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy; however, systematic examination using ethanol biomarkers is lacking. METHODS: This study utilized data collected through the Navajo Birth Cohort Study (NBCS)-a birth cohort study of a Southwestern tribal community. Prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) was assessed by a battery of meconium biomarkers among 333 NBCS participants. Meconium samples were analyzed for nine individual fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) species, ethyl glucuronide (EtG), and ethyl sulfate (EtS) by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Participants were recruited from five hospitals at the Navajo Nation located in Arizona (Chinle, Tsehootsooi, Tuba City) and New Mexico (Gallup, Shiprock). All participants identified as Native American; most reported a personal income of <$20,000 per year (71.3%), and </=high school education (55.3%). The most prevalent biomarker was EtS (7.8%) followed by ethyl oleate (6.9%); 5.4% of the sample were positive for at least two biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study on the prevalence of PAE in the Navajo Nation, obtained for the first time with an objective comprehensive panel of meconium biomarkers, indicate that the rates in the NBCS may be comparable to the general U.S. population and are in accord with recent U.S. national survey estimates. Our findings emphasize that drinking behaviors among Native American communities in the United States can vary, and generalization across all Native American populations is not warranted.",

			"abstract": "AIM: This study examined the prevalence and clinical significance of the sapovirus infection in children with acute gastroenteritis before and after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccination in Finland in 2009. METHODS: We collected 1437 stool samples from children under 16 years during three prospective hospital-based surveillance studies of acute gastroenteritis at Tampere University Hospital, Finland. The children were seen in the emergency department (47%) or admitted to the ward (53%). Sapovirus findings from 2006 to 2008 (n = 759), before national immunisation, were compared to 2009-2011 (n = 330) and 2012-2014 (n = 348), after the national programme was launched. RESULTS: The overall incidence of the sapovirus was 3.3%. It was present in 1.4% of acute gastroenteritis cases in 2006-2008 and 5.5% in the post-vaccination years, but the absolute number did not increase. Sapoviruses mainly occurred in the winter and spring, but did not follow the prevalence of the norovirus or rotavirus. Sapovirus GI.1 and GII.1 were the most common genotypes, but the predominant strain was different each season. Many sapovirus lineages appeared during multiple seasons and reappeared later. CONCLUSION: The sapovirus was uncommonly and sporadically detected in children seen in the hospital for acute gastroenteritis, and its relative role increased after national immunisation was introduced.",

			"article_name": "Travel to Asia is a strong predictor for carriage of cephalosporin resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp. but does not explain everything; prevalence study at a Norwegian hospital 2014-2016.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of faecal carriage of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae (ESCr-EK) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in patients upon hospital admission and identify factors associated with carriage to better target interventions and to guide empirical antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Between October 2014 and December 2016, we recruited patients admitted to a Norwegian university hospital. A rectal swab and questionnaire covering possible risk factors for colonisation were collected upon admission. Isolates were characterized by phenotypic methods. ESCr-EK isolates were subject to whole genome sequencing. We calculated prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) using binomial regression. RESULTS: Of 747 patients, 45 (6.0%) were colonised with ESCr-EK, none with VRE. The ESCr-EK isolates in 41 patients were multidrug resistant; no isolates were non-suceptible to meropenem. Prevalence of ESCr-EK was higher among travellers to Asia (aPR = 6.6; 95%CI 3.6-12; p < 0.001). No statistical significant difference in carriage was observed between departments, age or any other factors in the univariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The observed prevalence of ESCr-EK colonisation upon admission was in the same range but lower than that reported in similar studies from Europe. Travel to Asia was a strong predictor for colonisation of ESCr-EK to be considered when administering empirical antimicrobial treatment. As less than one third of colonised patients had travelled to Asia, and no other factors investigated were found to be strongly associated with carriage, these findings underscore that healthcare personnel must apply standard infection control precautions for all patients.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this prospective cohort study, we investigated the association between fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium as biomarkers of prenatal ethanol exposure and growth deficits, as birth outcomes, that constitute several of the key cardinal features of fetal alcohol syndrome. METHODS: A total of 157 meconium samples were collected from enrolled infants within 24 hours of birth, and nine FAEEs were quantified using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The relationships between cumulative concentrations of nine species of FAEEs in meconium and birth parameters of growth (age-sex-specific centiles of head circumference [HC], weight, and length) and respective and combined birth outcomes of growth deficits (HC </= 10th centile, weight </= 10th centile, and length </= 10th centile) were determined. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher cumulative concentrations of meconium FAEEs correlated with elevated risks for HC and length, both, 10th percentile or less (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-7.74; P = 0.029) and HC and weight and length, all of them, 10th percentile or less (aOR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.12-9.59; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: The elevated cumulative FAEEs in meconium were associated with combined growth deficits at birth, specifically HC and length, both, 10th percentile or less, which might be correlated with detrimental alcohol effects on fetal brain and bone development, suggesting a plausible alcohol-specific pattern of intrauterine growth restriction.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association between antibiotic use during pregnancy and neonatal birth outcomes has received considerable attention. Most of the previous assessment of antibiotic exposure during pregnancy relied on questionnaires and clinical prescriptions, and very few studies examined pregnancy exposure to antibiotics using human biomonitoring data. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between the cumulative exposure of antibiotics during the whole pregnancy and neonatal birth measurements using biomonitoring data of antibiotics in meconium. METHODS: Three hundred and sixty nine pregnant women within the Maternal Psychological and Environmental Assessments of Kids Cohort Study were randomly selected into this study. Eighteen common antibiotics of six categories (six beta\u2011lactams, three tetracyclines, four sulfonamides, one phenicols, one lincosamides and three fluoroquinolones) were selected as the target antibiotics in meconium. The measurement was conducted by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry platform. Neonatal birth measurements were obtained from the medical records. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the associations of antibiotic exposure with neonatal birth outcome (birth weight, birth length) and placental growth indicators (placental surface area, placental weight). Logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations with small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA). RESULTS: Twelve of the eighteen antibiotics were found in 62.1% of the meconium, with detection rates ranging from 0.3% to 43.9%. The three antibiotics with the highest detection rates were chlortetracycline (43.9%), penicillin (16.5%) and chloramphenicol (10.8%), respectively. The highest antibiotic concentration among detected antibiotics was penicillin (24,243.15\u202fmug/kg). The concentration of penicillin was positively associated with the birth weight (beta: 0.025; 95% CIs: 0.003-0.047). A significant positive association was also observed between the concentration of chlortetracycline and the placental surface area (beta: 2.559; 95% CIs: 0.296-4.822). These associations were sex related and mainly observed in female newborns. Exposure to penicillin was also found to be associated with increased risk of LGA, which was consistent with changes in birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy exposure to certain antibiotics was associated with altered fetal growth and development, which may affect the normal growth trajectory of infants and children in later life.",

More information and research on EV-B80 is needed to assess its genetic characteristics, phylogenetic relationships, and association with enteroviral diseases. In this study, we report the phylogenetic characteristics of three Xinjiang EV-B80 strains and one Tibet EV-B80 strain in China. The full-length genomic sequences of four strains show 78.8-79% nucleotide identity and 94-94.2% amino acid identity with the prototype of EV-B80, indicating a tendency for evolution. Based on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the entire VP1 region, three genotypes (A-C) were defined, revealing the possible origin of EV-B80 strains in the mainland of China. Recombination analysis revealed intraspecies recombinations in all four EV-B80 strains in nonstructural regions along with two recombination patterns. Due to the geographic factor, the coevolution of EV-B strains formed two different patterns of circulation. An antibody seroprevalence study against EV-B80 in two Xinjiang prefectures also showed that EV-B80 strains were widely prevalent in Xinjiang, China, compared to other studies on EV-B106 and EV-B89. All four EV-B80 strains are not temperature sensitive, showing a higher transmissibility in the population. In summary, this study reports the full-length genomic sequences of EV-B80 and provides valuable information on global EV-B80 molecular epidemiology.",

While an association with gastrointestinal symptoms has been described in some settings, factors influencing differences in clinical presentation are not well understood. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we show that a complex interplay between human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), milk microbiome, and infant gut microbiome impacts neonatal rotavirus infections. Validating in vitro studies where HMOs are not decoy receptors for neonatal strain G10P[11], population studies show significantly higher levels of Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL), and 6'-siallylactose (6'SL) in milk from mothers of rotavirus-positive neonates with gastrointestinal symptoms. Further, these HMOs correlate with abundance of Enterobacter/Klebsiella in maternal milk and infant stool. Specific HMOs also improve the infectivity of a neonatal strain-derived rotavirus vaccine. This study provides molecular and translational insight into host factors influencing neonatal rotavirus infections and identifies maternal components that could promote the performance of live, attenuated rotavirus vaccines.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insufficient early immune stimulation may predispose to atopic disease. Staphylococcus aureus, a skin and gut colonizer, produces the B-cell mitogen protein A and T-cell-activating superantigens. Early gut colonization by S. aureus strains that possess the superantigens encoded by the enterotoxin gene (egc) cluster and elastin-binding protein is negatively associated with development of atopic eczema. OBJECTIVES: To investigate (i) whether these findings could be replicated in a second birth cohort, FARMFLORA, and (ii) whether nasal colonization by S. aureus also relates to subsequent atopic eczema development. METHODS: Faecal samples and nasal swabs from infants in the FARMFLORA birth cohort (n = 65) were cultured for S. aureus. Individual strains were distinguished by random amplified polymorphic DNA and assessed for adhesin and superantigen gene carriage by polymerase chain reaction. Atopic eczema at 18 months of age was related to nasal and gut S. aureus colonization patterns during the first 2 months of life (well before onset of eczema). RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus colonization per se was unrelated to subsequent eczema development. However, gut S. aureus strains from the infants who subsequently developed atopic eczema less frequently carried the ebp gene, encoding elastin-binding protein, and superantigen genes encoded by egc, compared with strains from children who remained healthy. Nasal colonization by S. aureus was less clearly related to subsequent eczema development. CONCLUSIONS: The results precisely replicate our previous observations and may suggest that mucosal colonization by certain S. aureus strains provides immune stimulation that strengthens the epithelial barrier and counteracts the development of atopic eczema.",

We aimed to explore the characteristics of NTS isolated from paediatric patients in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 4586 stool culture collected at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center from 2014 to 2016. RESULTS: We identified 220 (4.80%) NTS isolates in stool samples. Fourteen serotypes were identified among the 220 NTS isolates. Salmonella serotype Typhimurium was the most common serotype, representing 69.09%. The highest rate of resistance was recorded in relation to AMP (76.61%), followed by SXT (29.95%), CTX (29.93%), CHL (29.77%), CAZ (23.20%), CIP (7.51%), and CFS (7.18%). The resistance rates of NTS and serotype Typhimurium to CAZ in 2015 were significantly higher than those in 2014. The average hospitalisation duration of inpatients infected by NTS resistant to three or more clinically important agents was significantly longer than that of patients infected with NTS with less antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: NTS represents a major cause of paediatric gastroenteritis in Guangzhou, China, and the high level of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins coupled with increasing resistance to quinolones among isolated NTS from paediatric gastroenteritis is a serious public health concern that requires continued monitoring and rational usage of antibiotics.",

However, traveller's diarrhoea can also result from travel between high and low disease transmission regions within a country, which is the focus of this study. METHODS: We recruited participants for a case-control study of diarrhoea at four sites along an urban-rural gradient in Northern Ecuador: Quito, Esmeraldas, Borbon and rural communities outside of Borbon. At each of these sites, approximately 100 subjects with diarrhoea (cases) were recruited from Ministry of Health clinics and were age-matched with subjects visiting the same clinics for other complaints (controls). RESULTS: Travellers to urban destinations had higher risk of diarrhoea and diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) infections. Travel to Quito was associated with diarrhoea (aOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.10-3.68) and travel to Guayaquil (another urban centre in Ecuador) was associated with Diffuse Adherent E. coli infection (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.01-4.33). Compared to those not travelling, urban origins were also associated with greater risk of diarrhoea in Esmeraldas (aOR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.20-4.41), and with higher risk of diarrhoeagenic E. coli infections in Quito (aOR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.16-5.86), with >50% of travel from Quito and Esmeraldas specified to another urban destination. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that individuals travelling from lower-transmission regions (rural areas) to higher transmission regions (urban centres) within a single country are at a greater risk of acquiring a diarrhoea-related illness. Investments to improve water, sanitation and hygiene conditions in urban areas could have impacts on outlying rural areas within a given country.",

			"abstract": "Swimming in fecally contaminated recreational water may lead to gastrointestinal illness. A recreational water-associated outbreak of norovirus (NoV) infections affecting at least 100 people in The Netherlands occurred in August 2012. Questionnaire responses from patients indicated swimming in recreational lake Zeumeren as the most likely cause of illness. Most patients visited the lake during the weekend of 18(-)19 August, during which the weather was exceptionally warm (maximum temperatures 32(-)33  degrees C), and visitor numbers elevated. Patients, mostly children, became ill with gastroenteritis 1(-)6 days (median 2 days) after exposure. Four stool samples from patients were NoV GI positive. Subsurface sandy soil from one of the beaches where most patients swam was NoV GI positive; the water sample was negative. The epidemiological curve and the timeline of investigation based on reported symptoms demonstrate the difficulty in discovering the source in recreational water outbreaks. A NoV outbreak in a recreational lake that is not subjected to external fecal contamination sources shows the need for active communication about human shedding of viruses during and after diarrheal episodes and the advice to refrain from swimming, even a few weeks after the symptoms have resolved.",

			"article_name": "Metabolic adaptation in the human gut microbiota during pregnancy and the first year of life.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between the gut microbiome and the human host is dynamic and we may expect adjustments in microbiome function if host physiology changes. Metatranscriptomic approaches should be key in unraveling how such adjustments occur. METHODS: We employ metatranscriptomic sequencing analyses to study gene expression in the gut microbiota of infants through their first year of life, and of their mothers days before delivery and one year afterwards. FINDINGS: In infants, hallmarks of aerobic metabolism disappear from the microbial metatranscriptome as development proceeds, while the expression of functions related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism increases and diversifies, approaching that observed in non-pregnant women. Butyrate synthesis enzymes are overexpressed at three months of age, even though most butyrate-producing organisms are still rare. In late pregnancy, the microbiota readjusts the expression of carbohydrate-related functions in a manner consistent with a high availability of glucose. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that butyrate production may be ensured in the gut of young infants before the typical butyrate synthesizers of the adult gut become abundant. The late pregnancy gut microbiota may be able to access the high levels of blood glucose characteristic of this period. Moreover, late pregnancy gut bacteria may reach stationary phase, which may affect their likelihood of translocating across the intestinal epithelium.

			"abstract": "Limited knowledge is available on total fluoride exposure, excretion and retention in infants, despite the first year of human life being the critical period for dental development and risk of dental fluorosis. This study investigated total daily fluoride intake (TDFI), excretion (TDFE) and retention (TDFR) in infants living in fluoridated and non-fluoridated water areas at pre- and post-weaning stages of development. Healthy infants, aged 0-12 months, were recruited and their TDFI (mg/kg body weight (BW) per d), from diet and toothpaste ingestion, was assessed over a 3-d period using a dietary diary and tooth-brushing questionnaire. TDFE (mg/kg BW per d) was estimated by collecting 48-h urine and faeces. TDFR (mg/kg BW per d) was estimated by subtracting TDFE from TDFI. A total of forty-seven infants completed the study: sixteen at pre-weaning and thirty-one at post-weaning stages, with a mean age of 3.4 and 10.0 months, respectively. TDFI was lower in the non-fluoridated area (P&lt;0.001) and at the pre-weaning stage (P=0.002) but higher in formula-fed infants (P&lt;0.001). TDFE was mainly affected by type of feeding, with higher excretion in formula-fed infants (P&lt;0.001). TDFR was lower in the non-fluoridated area (P&lt;0.001) and at the pre-weaning stage (P&lt;0.001) but higher in formula-fed infants (P=0.001). In conclusion, a relatively large proportion of fluoride intake is retained in the body in weaned infants. This is an important consideration in fluoride-based prevention programmes, with goals to maximise caries prevention while minimising the risk of dental fluorosis.",

Bifidobacterium spp., in particular, has been hypothesized to play a health-promoting role, yet little is known about how delivery mode modifies colonization of the newborn by this group of microbes. The aim of this research was to examine the presence of Bifidobacterium in meconium and in the transitional stool, and to assess cytokine levels and hematological parameters in the venous cord blood of infants born by elective, pre-labor Cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery in Southern Brazil. We recruited 89 mother-newborn pairs (23 vaginal delivery and 66 elective cesarean delivery), obtained demographic information from a structured questionnaire and clinical information from medical records. We obtained umbilical cord venous blood and meconium samples following delivery and the transitional stool (the first defecation after meconium) before discharge. We determined plasma levels of IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-5, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-8 in the cord blood, and presence of stool Bifidobacterium by real time PCR. Compared to vaginally-delivered neonates, Cesarean-delivered neonates had a lower leukocyte count (p = 0.037), lower hemoglobin (p = 0.04), and lower levels of the cytokine GM-CSF (p = 0.009) in the cord blood. Moreover, Bifidobacterium was detected less often in the transitional stool of Cesarean-delivered neonates compared to vaginally-delivered neonates (p = 0.001). The results indicate that pre-labor Cesarean birth may be associated with microbial and hematological alterations in the neonate. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined in larger prospective birth cohort studies.",

Although precise data on childhood mortality associated with diarrheal disease in Nepal is not available, it is estimated that22% of all rotavirus deaths globally occurs in neighboring country of India. In spite of the substantial burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the Indian subcontinent, rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced in Nepal. Continuous surveillance for monitoring rotavirus disease burden and molecular characterization is needed prior to rotavirus vaccine introduction in Nepal. METHODS: A total of 3310 stool samples (2849 hospitalized cases and 461 non-hospitalized cases), were collected from patients <5\u202fyears of age from January 2013 to December 2016 and tested for rotavirus antigen by ELISA (ProSpecT, USA). A subset of ELISA positive stool samples was genotyped. Demographic data were collected. RESULTS: During the four-year surveillance period, the overall burden of rotavirus infection was 24% among hospitalized children which was much higher than among non-hospitalized children (12%). The majority of children hospitalized with rotavirus gastroenteritis were less than 2\u202fyears of age (86%). Rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis hospitalizations occur year-round in Nepal, but a distinct peak in winter (up to 40% among hospitalized) was observed. Of 735 ELISA positive samples, 492 were genotyped by RT-PCR. The most prevalent genotype was G12P[6] (45.3%), followed byG2P[4](12.2%), G1P[8] (9.6%), G9P[4](7.3%), and G9P[8](4.5%). Mixed infection accounted for 4.4% of cases, 6.2% were partially typed and 10.5% of the samples were G and P untypable. CONCLUSIONS: A high burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis and a diversity of circulating rotavirus strains in Nepal were observed. Recommendation to introduce a rotavirus vaccine with known vaccine effectiveness would help in reducing the severity of Rotavirus diarrheal disease in children less than 5\u202fyears of age.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meconium stained amniotic fluid is one of the risk factors to increase the rate of perinatal morbidity and mortality both in developed and developing countries. Due to a multitude of factors associated with socioeconomic and quality of service, the ill effect of meconium stained amniotic fluid is even worse in developing countries. But very little information is known about the situation in Ethiopia, particularly the study area to design appropriate prevention strategies. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and its associated factors among women who gave birth at term in Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital, North West Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital from March 02-May 27, 2018. A total of 495 mothers were included in the study. The study participants were selected by systematic random sampling technique. A combination of chart review and interview were used to collect the data. Data entry and analysis were made by using Epi-data version 3.1 and SPSS versions 23 respectively. Both descriptive & analytical statistics were computed. Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05 and the strength of association was assessed by using adjusted odds ratio. RESULT: The prevalence of meconium stained amniotic fluid was found to be 17.8%. Women whose age greater than 30 years [AOR =5.63, 95%CI =3.35-9.44], duration of labor greater than 24 h [AOR = 7.1, 95%Cl =1.67-29.68], induced labor [AOR = 2.60, 95% CI =1.39-4.87], preeclampsia [AOR = 3.45, 95%CI =1.26-9.37] and obstructed labor [AOR =5.9, 95%CI =1.29-29.68] were found to be associated with meconium stained amniotic fluid. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of meconium stained amniotic fluid was similar as compared to the international standard. Preeclampsia, maternal age, obstructed labor, induced labor and longer duration of labor were factors associated with an increased risk for meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Thus, early detection and timely intervention are mandatory to decrease prolonged and obstructed labor.",

			"abstract": "Commensal gut bacterial communities (microbiomes) are predicted to influence human health and disease(1,2). Neonatal gut microbiomes are colonized with maternal and environmental flora and mature toward a stable composition over 2-3 years(3,4). To study pre- and postnatal determinants of infant microbiome development, we analyzed 402 fecal metagenomes from 60 infants aged 0-8 months, using longitudinal generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Distinct microbiome signatures correlated with breastfeeding, formula ingredients, and maternal gestational weight gain (GWG). Amino acid synthesis pathway accretion in breastfed microbiomes complemented normative breastmilk composition. Prebiotic oligosaccharides, designed to promote breastfed-like microflora(5), predicted functional pathways distinct from breastfed infant microbiomes. Soy formula in six infants was positively associated with Lachnospiraceae and pathways suggesting a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-rich environment, including glycerol to 1-butanol fermentation, which is potentially dysbiotic. GWG correlated with altered carbohydrate degradation and enriched vitamin synthesis pathways. Maternal and postnatal antibiotics predicted microbiome alterations, while delivery route had no persistent effects. Domestic water source correlates suggest water may be an underappreciated determinant of microbiome acquisition. Clinically important microbial pathways with statistically significant dietary correlates included dysbiotic markers(6,7), core enterotype features(8), and synthesis pathways for enteroprotective(9) and immunomodulatory(10,11) metabolites, epigenetic mediators(1), and developmentally critical vitamins(12), warranting further investigation.",

			"abstract": "Research on the neonatal microbiome has been performed mostly on hospital-born infants, who often undergo multiple birth-related interventions. Both the hospital environment and interventions around the time of birth may affect the neonate microbiome. In this study, we determine the structure of the microbiota in feces from babies born in the hospital or at home, and from vaginal samples of their mothers. We included 35 vaginally-born, breast-fed neonates, 14 of whom delivered at home (4 in water), and 21 who delivered in the hospital. Feces from babies and mothers and maternal vaginal swab samples were collected at enrollment, the day of birth, followed by days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28. At the time of birth, the diversity of the vaginal microbiota of mothers delivering in the hospital was higher than in mothers delivering at home, and showed higher proportion of Lactobacillus. Among 20 infants not exposed to perinatal maternal antibiotics or water birth, fecal beta diversity differed significantly by birth site, with hospital-born infants having lower Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus, and higher Clostridium and Enterobacteriaceae family (LDA > 3.0), than babies born at home. At 1 month of age, feces from infants born in the hospital also induced greater pro-inflammatory gene expression (TLR4, IL-8, occludin and TGFbeta) in human colon epithelial HT-29 cells. The results of this work suggest that hospitalization (perinatal interventions or the hospital environment) may affect the microbiota of the vaginal source and the initial colonization during labor and birth, with effects that could persist in the intestinal microbiota of infants 1 month after birth. More research is needed to determine specific factors that alter bacterial transmission between mother and baby and the long-term health implications of these differences for the developing infant.",

The burden of norovirus disease in low-income settings is poorly understood. METHODS: We tested stool samples from children less than 5 years of age with diarrhea who were admitted in a rural hospital in Bangladesh from 2010-2012 and from matched, healthy controls from the same catchment area. RESULTS: Norovirus was detected in 109 (18%) of 613 children with diarrhea and in 30 (15%) of 206 healthy controls. Most (n = 118; 85%) norovirus infections belonged to genogroup II (GII).

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prenatal and neonatal environmental factors, such as nutrition, microbes and toxicants, may affect health throughout life. Many diseases, such as allergy and impaired child development, may be programmed already in utero or during early infancy. Birth cohorts are important tools to study associations between early life exposure and disease risk. Here, we describe the study protocol of the prospective birth cohort, 'Nutritional impact on Immunological maturation during Childhood in relation to the Environment' (NICE). The primary aim of the NICE cohort is to clarify the effect of key environmental exposures-diet, microbes and environmental toxicants-during pregnancy and early childhood, on the maturation of the infant's immune system, including initiation of sensitisation and allergy as well as some secondary outcomes: infant growth, obesity, neurological development and oral health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The NICE cohort will recruit about 650 families during mid-pregnancy. The principal inclusion criterion will be planned birth at the Sunderby Hospital in the north of Sweden, during 2015-2018. Questionnaires data and biological samples will be collected at 10 time-points, from pregnancy until the children reach 4 years of age. Samples will be collected primarily from mothers and children, and from fathers. Biological samples include blood, urine, placenta, breast milk, meconium, faeces, saliva and hair. Information regarding allergic heredity, diet, socioeconomic status, lifestyle including smoking, siblings, pet ownership, etc will be collected using questionnaires. Sensitisation to common allergens will be assessed by skin prick testing and allergic disease will be diagnosed by a paediatrician at 1 and 4 years of age. At 4 years of age, the children will also be examined regarding growth, neurobehavioural and neurophysiological status and oral health. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The NICE cohort has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Umea, Sweden (2013/18-31M). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and communicated on scientific conferences.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut dysbiosis has been suggested as a major risk factor for the development of late-onset sepsis (LOS), a main cause of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. We aimed to assess specific signatures of the gut microbiome, including metabolic profiles, in preterm infants <34 weeks of gestation preceding LOS. METHODS: In a single-center cohort, fecal samples from preterm infants were prospectively collected during the period of highest vulnerability for LOS (days 7, 14, and 21 of life). Following 16S rRNA gene profiling, we assessed microbial community function using microbial metabolic network modeling. Data were adjusted for gestational age and use of probiotics. RESULTS: We studied stool samples from 71 preterm infants with LOS and 164 unaffected controls (no LOS/necrotizing enterocolitis). In most cases, the bacteria isolated in diagnostic blood culture corresponded to the genera in the gut microbiome. LOS cases had a decelerated development of microbial diversity. Before onset of disease, LOS cases had specific gut microbiome signatures with higher abundance of Bacilli (specifically coagulase-negative Staphylococci) and a lack of anaerobic bacteria. In silico modeling of bacterial community metabolism suggested accumulation of the fermentation products ethanol and formic acid in LOS cases before the onset of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal dysbiosis preceding LOS is characterized by an accumulation of Bacilli and their fermentation products and a paucity of anaerobic bacteria. Early microbiome and metabolic patterns may become a valuable biomarker to guide individualized prevention strategies of LOS in highly vulnerable populations.",

Non-IgE mediated (NIM) forms are little studied and the responsible mechanisms of tolerance acquisition remain obscure. Our aim was to study the intestinal microbiota and related parameters in the fecal samples of infants with NIM-CMPA, to establish potential links between type of formula substitutes, microbiota, and desensitization. Seventeen infants between one and two years old, diagnosed with NIM-CMPA, were recruited. They were all on an exclusion diet for six months, consuming different therapeutic protein hydrolysates. After this period, stool samples were obtained and tolerance development was evaluated by oral challenges. A control group of 10 age-matched healthy infants on an unrestricted diet were included in the study. Microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids, calprotectin, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) levels were determined in fecal samples from both groups. Infants with NIM-CMPA that consumed vegetable protein-based formulas presented microbiota colonization patterns different from those fed with an extensively hydrolyzed formula. Differences in microbiota composition and fecal parameters between NIM-CMPA and healthy infants were observed. Non-allergic infants showed a significantly higher proportion of Bacteroides compared to infants with NIM-CMPA. The type of protein hydrolysate was found to determine gut microbiota colonization and influence food allergy resolution in NIM-CMPA cases.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A monovalent rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the Ethiopian Expanded Program on Immunization from November 2013. We compared impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction on rotavirus associated acute diarrhea hospitalizations and genotypic characteristics of rotavirus strains pre-and post-vaccine introduction. METHODS: Sentinel surveillance for diarrhea among children <5\u202fyears of age was conducted at 3 hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 2011 to 2017. Stool specimens were collected from enrolled children and tested using an antigen capture enzyme immunoassay. Rotavirus positive samples (156 from pre- and 141 from post-vaccination periods) were further characterized by rotavirus genotyping methods to identify the predominant G and P types circulating during the surveillance era. RESULTS: A total of 788 children were enrolled during the pre- (July 2011-June 2013) and 815 children during the post-vaccination (July 2014-June 2017) periods. The proportion of diarrhea hospitalizations due to rotavirus among children <5\u202fyears of age declined by 17% from 24% (188/788) in the pre-vaccine period and to 20% (161/185) in post-vaccine introduction era. Similarly, a reduction of 18% in proportion of diarrhea hospitalizations due to rotavirus in children <12\u202fmonths of age in the post (27%) vs pre-vaccine (33%) periods was observed. Seasonal peaks of rotavirus declined following rotavirus vaccine introduction. The most prevalent circulating strains were G12P[8] in 2011 (36%) and in 2012 (27%), G2P[4] (35%) in 2013, G9P[8] (19%) in 2014, G3P[6] and G2P[4] (19% each) in 2015, and G3P[8] (29%) in 2016. DISCUSSION: Following rotavirus vaccine introduction in Ethiopia, a reduction in rotavirus associated hospitalizations was seen in all age groups with the greatest burden in children <12\u202fmonths of age. A wide variety of rotavirus strains circulated in the pre- and post-vaccine introduction periods.",

Nevertheless, limited data is available about the occurrence of neglected parasitic diseases among migrant population. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of intestinal and urinary parasites in newly arrived asylum seekers. METHODS: A total of 364 newly arrived migrants hosted at the Asylum Seekers Centre of Castelnuovo di Porto (Italy) were screened during 8 months period for intestinal and urinary parasites. Each enrolled subject was interviewed using a standardized questionnaire, with focus on socio-demographical data and risk factors of parasitic infections. RESULTS: Stool analysis showed a prevalence of intestinal parasites of 20.6%. The travel route did not affect the prevalence of intestinal parasites (p\u202f=\u202f0.096), while a significant negative correlation was found between the length of travel and the prevalence of parasite infection (p\u202f=\u202f0.019). No statistically significant correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of intestinal parasites was detected. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis reported in asylum seekers does not necessarily reflect the prevalence of the parasitosis in the motherland. An anamnestic and syndromic approach may not be sufficient to highlight the problem of intestinal parasitic infestations in a screening setting.",

To determine whether certain EV types are more often associated with diarrhea, we conducted a preliminary study on the prevalence of EV serotypes and common diarrhea viruses in fecal samples of diarrhea children and healthy controls. EV was tested with one step nest polymerase chain reaction and typed by direct sequencing while common causative diarrhea viruses rotavirus (RV), norovirus (NoV), adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (HBoV), and astrovirus (AstV) were screened with multiplex PCR assays. Human Rhinovirus (HRV) and human EVs that were present in both groups were further quantified and their odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Enteric pathogens were detected in 89 (32.6%) of 273 children with diarrhea and included human EVs (51, 18.68%), HRV (32, 11.72%), RV (38, 13.92%), AdV (24, 8.79%), NoVGII (16, 8.79%), HBoV (8, 2.93%) and AstV (3, 1.09%). Potential enteric pathogens were found in 25 (6.93%) of 361 healthy controls and included human EV (59, 16.34%), HRV (8, 2.22%), RV (1, 0.28%), NoVGII (5, 1.39%), AstV (2, 0.55%), AdV (16, 4.43%) and HBoV (1, 0.28%).

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Neonatal jaundice is a common disease that affects up to 60% of newborns. Gut microbiota mediated the excretion of bilirubin from the human body. However, the relationship between early gut microbiome and development of neonatal jaundice is not fully understood. Here we sought to characterize meconium microbiome of newborns and to clarify its association with risk of neonatal jaundice. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study with 301 newborns providing meconium samples from 2014 to 2015. The main outcome was the development of neonatal jaundice at 42 day follow-up. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to profile the meconium microbiome. LEfSe was employed to identify different features between control and case groups. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk effect of early gut microbiome on neonatal jaundice. RESULTS: Logistic regression models suggested that higher a-diversity was significantly associated with lower risk of jaundice in cesarean infants (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.98), but not in infants born naturally. Higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum in newborn meconium was significantly associated with lower risk of jaundice both in cesarean-born infants and in the total subjects (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.68; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.95, respectively). Spearman's correlations showed that relative abundance of B. pseudolongum was significantly correlated with a-diversity (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Preventive and treatment methods implying early gut microbiome intervention could be promising for the management of neonatal jaundice.",

			"abstract": "Inactivation of pulmonary surfactant by different components such as serum, cholesterol or meconium contributes to severe respiratory pathologies through destabilization and collapse of airspaces. Recent studies have analyzed in detail how the interfacial properties of natural surfactant purified from animal lungs are altered as a consequence of its exposure to serum proteins or meconium-mobilized cholesterol. It has been also demonstrated that pre-exposure of surfactant to polymers such as hyaluronic acid provides resistance to inactivation by multiple inhibitory agents. In the current work, we have extended these studies to the analysis of Surfacen, a clinical surfactant currently in use to rescue premature babies suffering or at risk of respiratory distress due to congenital lack of surfactant. This surfactant is also strongly inhibited by both meconium and serum when tested in the captive bubble surfactometer (CBS) under conditions mimicking respiratory dynamics. As it occurs with native surfactant, Surfacen is markedly protected from inhibition by pre-exposure to hyaluronic acid, confirming that clinical surfactants can be improved to treat pathologies associated with strongly deactivating contexts, such as those associated with lung injury and inflammation. Remarkably, we found that, under physiologically-mimicking conditions, a cholesterol-free clinical surfactant such as Surfacen is less susceptible to inhibition by cholesterol-mobilizing environments than cholesterol-containing natural surfactant, as a consequence of a markedly reduced susceptibility to incorporation of exogenous cholesterol.",

In this study, we sought the clinical determinants of the relative abundance of feces-associated Gammaproteobacteria in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Fecal microbiome was characterized at </= 2 weeks and during the 3rd and 4th weeks after birth, by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Maternal and infant clinical characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records. Data were analyzed by linear mixed modeling and linear regression. RESULTS: Clinical data and fecal microbiome profiles of 45 VLBW infants (gestational age 27.9 +/- 2.2 weeks; birth weight 1126 +/- 208 g) were studied. Three stool samples were analyzed for each infant at mean postnatal ages of 9.9 +/- 3, 20.7 +/- 4.1, and 29.4 +/- 4.9 days. The average relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was 42.5% (0-90%) at </= 2 weeks, 69.7% (29.9-86.9%) in the 3rd, and 75.5% (54.5-86%) in the 4th week (p < 0.001). Hierarchical and K-means clustering identified two distinct subgroups: cluster 1 started with comparatively low abundance that increased with time, whereas cluster 2 began with a greater abundance at </= 2 weeks (p < 0.001) that decreased over time. Both groups resembled each other by the 3rd week. Single variants of Klebsiella and Staphylococcus described variance in community structure between clusters and were shared between all infants, suggesting a common, hospital-derived source. Fecal Gammaproteobacteria was positively associated with vaginal delivery and antenatal steroids. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a dichotomy in gut microbiome assembly in preterm infants: some preterm infants started with low relative gammaproteobacterial abundance in stool that increased as a function of postnatal age, whereas others began with and maintained high abundance. Vaginal birth and antenatal steroids were identified as predictors of Gammaproteobacteria abundance in the early (</= 2 weeks) and later (3rd and 4th weeks) stool samples, respectively. These findings are important in understanding the development of the gut microbiome in premature infants.",

Before clinical implementation, the factors influencing the outcome of VOC analysis need to be assessed. Recent studies found that the sampling conditions can influence the outcome of VOC analysis. However, the dietary influences remains unknown, especially in (preterm) infants. Therefore, we assessed the effects of feeding composition on fecal VOC patterns of preterm infants (born at <30 weeks gestation). Two subgroups were defined: (1) daily intake >75% breastmilk (BM) feeding and (2) daily intake >75% formula milk (FM) feeding. Fecal samples, which were collected at 7, 14 and 21 days postnatally, were analyzed by an electronic nose device (Cyranose 320((R))). In total, 30 preterm infants were included (15 FM, 15 BM). No differences in the fecal VOC patterns were observed at the three predefined time-points. Combining the fecal VOC profiles of these time-points resulted in a statistically significant difference between the two subgroups although this discriminative accuracy was only modest (AUC [95% CI]; p-value; sensitivity; and specificity of 0.64 [0.51(-)0.77]; 0.04; 68%; and 51%, respectively). Our results suggest that the influence of enteral feeding on the outcome of fecal VOC analysis cannot be ignored in this population. Furthermore, in both subgroups, the fecal VOC patterns showed a stable longitudinal course within the first month of life.",

This prospective birth cohort study probed the previously observed association between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopment by using concentrations of acetaminophen measured in meconium, which more objectively captures exposure of the fetus than maternal report. Exposure, measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, was categorized into nondetection, low detection, and high detection levels. At age 6-8 years, children completed a set of subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition. Additionally, this study examined potential effect modification by child sex on the association between acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopment. In fully adjusted models, in utero exposure to acetaminophen was not statistically significantly associated with decreased scores on any of the examined subtests in all children combined (n = 118).

Thus, identifying the source of PeV-A is essential for prevention; however, little is known regarding the spread of PeV-A among family members of PeV-A-infected neonates and young infants. METHODS: In this prospective study, we evaluated stool samples from family members of PeV-A-infected neonates and infants younger than 4 months who presented with sepsis, meningoencephalitis, or both in Niigata, Japan, in 2016. Because of a simultaneous outbreak, enteroviruses (EVs) were also evaluated during this period. Real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by sequence analysis was used for viral diagnosis using serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid samples. RESULTS: Among 54 febrile patients, the stool samples of 14 (26%) and 12 (22%) patients tested positive for PeV-A and EV, respectively. Stool samples from 54 family members (38 adults and 16 children) of 12 PeV-A-infected patients were available. The rate of PeV-A positivity in these samples was higher among the children (88% [14 of 16]) than the adults (34% [13 of 38]). Among family members with a PeV-A-positive stool sample, 29% (4 of 14) of the children and 77% (10 of 13) of the adults were asymptomatic. Similarly, among 53 stool samples from family members (31 adults and 22 children) of 11 EV-infected patients, the rate of EV positivity in the stool samples was higher among the children (91% [20 of 22]) than among the adults (42% [13 of 31]). The asymptomatic-patient rates were 45% (9 of 20) among the children and 85% (11 of 13) among the adults in family members with EV-positive stool. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to EVs, PeV-A was detected frequently in stool samples from family members of PeV-A-infected patients. Among family members with PeV-A-positive stool, adults were more likely than children to be asymptomatic and therefore could be an important source of PeV-A infection.",

The aim of this study was to determine the viral etiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in US children aged <2 years. METHODS: The New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) of geographically diverse US sites conducts active pediatric population-based surveillance in hospitals and emergency departments. Stool samples were collected from children aged <2 years with symptoms of AGE (n = 330) and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n = 272) between January and December 2012. Samples were tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays adenovirus (type 40 and 41), norovirus, parechovirus A, enterovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus and an enzyme immunoassay (rotavirus). All samples that tested positive were genotyped. RESULTS: Detection rates of pathogens in children with AGE versus those of HCs were, respectively, 23.0% versus 6.6% for norovirus (P < .01), 23.0% versus 16.0% for adenovirus (P = .08), 11.0% versus 16.0% for parechovirus A (P = .09), 11.0% versus 9.0% for enterovirus (P = .34), 7.0% versus 3.0% for sapovirus (P = .07), 3.0% versus 0.3% for astrovirus (P = .01), and 3.0% versus 0.4% for rotavirus (P = .01). A high prevalence of adenovirus was detected at 1 surveillance site (49.0% for children with AGE and 43.0% for HCs). Norovirus GII.4 New Orleans was the most frequently detected (33.0%) norovirus genotype. Codetection of >1 virus was more common in children with AGE (16.0%) than in HCs (10.0%) (P = .03).

We hypothesized that infant colic is associated with gut inflammation linked to intestinal dysbiosis. STUDY DESIGN: A nested case-control design of 3 of our studies was used to analyze clinical and laboratory data at presentation, comparing babies with colic with controls. All investigators other than the biostatistician were blinded during data analysis. Subjects were recruited based on their age and crying + fussy time. We screened 65 infants, 37 with colic, as defined by Barr diary (crying + fussing time >3 hours daily), who were compared with 28 noncolicky infants. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin was elevated in babies with colic. For each mode of infant feeding (breast milk, formula, or breast + formula), infants' fecal calprotectin was higher in babies with colic. Infants with colic had similar levels of fecal alpha diversity (richness) when compared with controls, and alpha diversity was lower in breast-fed babies. Beta diversity at the phylum level revealed significant differences in microbial population. A phylum difference resulted from reduced Actinobacteria (95% of which are Bifidobacilli) in babies with colic. Species significantly associated with colic were Acinetobacter and Lactobacillus iners. CONCLUSIONS: Colic is linked with gut inflammation (as determined by fecal calprotectin) and dysbiosis, independent of mode of feeding, with fewer Bifidobacilli.

Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed microscopy-positive samples for Giardia duodenalis and the assemblages and sub-assemblages determined by multilocus sequence-based genotyping of the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and beta-giardin (bg) genes of the parasite. Identification of Blastocystis subtypes was carried out by amplification and sequencing of a partial fragment of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) of this heterokont microorganism. RESULTS: Overall, 46.1% (353/766) of the participants were infected/colonised by at least one intestinal parasite/commensal species. Protozoan and helminth species were detected in 42.7% and 10.1% of the surveyed population, respectively. Blastocystis sp. (28.2%), Endolimax nana (14.9%), and Giardia duodenalis (11.0%) were the most prevalent species found among protozoans and Ascaris lumbricoides (5.0%), Trichuris trichiura (4.6%) and hookworms (1.0%) among helminths. A total of 38 G. duodenalis-positive samples were genotyped at gdh and bg markers, revealing the presence of the sub-assemblages AII (47.4%), AII/AIII (2.6%), BIII (5.3%), BIV (26.3%) and BIII/BIV (13.1%). Two samples (5.3%) were only identified as assemblage B. AII was predominantly found in females aged 5-9 years and was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 102 Blastocystis-positive samples were successfully subtyped at the SSU rRNA gene revealing the presence of ST1 (36.3%), ST2 (15.7%), ST3 (41.2%), ST4 (2.9%), ST6 (1.0%) and ST8 (2.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Data presented here indicate that enteric parasites still represent a pressing health concern in Parana, Brazil, probably due to sub-optimal water, sanitation and hygiene conditions. A mostly anthroponotic origin is suspected for G. duodenalis and Blastocystis sp. infections.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Delivery room management of infants born via meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is quite controversial. No study has tried to quantify the amount of meconium that can be aspirated from the trachea of a non-vigorous neonate born through MSAF. AIMS: To study the yield of meconium in non-vigorous neonates born through MSAF undergoing endotracheal (ET) suctioning. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted from 1 March 2015 to 31 October 2015. A total of 760 neonates born through MSAF were enrolled. All non-vigorous neonates underwent ET suctioning. Meconium aspirated was quantified as nil (no meconium aspirated), insignificant (when only streaks of meconium were present in the ET tube), minimal (when the whole length of ET tube was filled with meconium) and significant (when the whole ET tube was filled with meconium and it poured into the suction tubing or when repeat suctioning was required). RESULTS: The amount of meconium aspirated from the trachea was nil to insignificant in 46% of the neonates who underwent tracheal suctioning. Only 14.4% of the neonates had significant meconium aspirated from the trachea. Almost 46% of the non-vigorous infants underwent tracheal suctioning without any important amount of meconium being aspirated from the trachea. CONCLUSION: The study further supports the recommendation put forth by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 2015 that selective intubation and tracheal suctioning of non-vigorous MSAF neonates might be of limited benefit.

			"article_name": "Type 2 Poliovirus Detection after Global Withdrawal of Trivalent Oral Vaccine.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mass campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) have brought the world close to the eradication of wild poliovirus. However, to complete eradication, OPV must itself be withdrawn to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). Synchronized global withdrawal of OPV began with serotype 2 OPV (OPV2) in April 2016, which presented the first test of the feasibility of eradicating all polioviruses. METHODS: We analyzed global surveillance data on the detection of serotype 2 Sabin vaccine (Sabin-2) poliovirus and serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2, defined as vaccine strains that are at least 0.6% divergent from Sabin-2 poliovirus in the viral protein 1 genomic region) in stool samples from 495,035 children with acute flaccid paralysis in 118 countries and in 8528 sewage samples from four countries at high risk for transmission; the samples were collected from January 1, 2013, through July 11, 2018. We used Bayesian spatiotemporal smoothing and logistic regression to identify and map risk factors for persistent detection of Sabin-2 poliovirus and VDPV2. RESULTS: The prevalence of Sabin-2 poliovirus in stool samples declined from 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5 to 4.3) at the time of OPV2 withdrawal to 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1 to 2.7) at 2 months after withdrawal, and the detection rate in sewage samples declined from 71.0% (95% CI, 61.0 to 80.0) to 13.0% (95% CI, 8.0 to 20.0) during the same period. However, 12 months after OPV2 withdrawal, Sabin-2 poliovirus continued to be detected in stool samples (<0.1%; 95% CI, <0.1 to 0.1) and sewage samples (8.0%; 95% CI, 5.0 to 13.0) because of the use of OPV2 in response to VDPV2 outbreaks. Nine outbreaks were reported after OPV2 withdrawal and were associated with low coverage of routine immunization (odds ratio, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.14 to 2.54] per 10% absolute decrease) and low levels of population immunity (odds ratio, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.35 to 5.59] per 10% absolute decrease) within affected countries. CONCLUSIONS: High population immunity has facilitated the decline in the prevalence of Sabin-2 poliovirus after OPV2 withdrawal and restricted the circulation of VDPV2 to areas known to be at high risk for transmission. The prevention of VDPV2 outbreaks in these known areas before the accumulation of substantial cohorts of children susceptible to type 2 poliovirus remains a high priority.

			"abstract": "Arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant with antimicrobial properties that can be found in food and drinking water. The influence of arsenic exposure on the composition of the human microbiome in US populations remains unknown, particularly during the vulnerable infant period. We investigated the relationship between arsenic exposure and gut microbiome composition in 204 infants prospectively followed as part of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Infant urine was analyzed for total arsenic concentration using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Stool microbiome composition was determined using sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Infant urinary arsenic related to gut microbiome composition at 6 weeks of life (p = 0.05, adjusted for infant feeding type and urine specific gravity). Eight genera, six within the phylum Firmicutes, were enriched with higher arsenic exposure. Fifteen genera were negatively associated with urinary arsenic concentration, including Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Upon stratification by both sex and feeding method, we found detectable associations among formula-fed males (p = 0.008), but not other groups (p > 0.05 for formula-fed females and for breastfed males and females). Our findings from a US population indicate that even moderate arsenic exposure may have meaningful, sex-specific effects on the gut microbiome during a critical window of infant development.",

			"abstract": "This study investigated the effects of different delivery modes on oral microflora in healthy newborns immediately post-partum, and provided evidence for microbial colonization disruption induced by medical procedures. Eighteen infants delivered by cesarean section and 74 by vaginal delivery were included in the study. High-throughput sequencing of 16S bacterial rRNA was performed on oral samples collected immediately after birth. All data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches. Our results indicated that different oral bacteria were found between infants delivered by cesarean section compared to vaginal delivery group. Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Gardnerella were the most abundant genera in the vaginal group, while Petrimonas, Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Tepidmicrobium, VadinCA02, and Bifidobacterium were dominant bacteria in the cesarean section (C-section) group. Furthermore, bacteria isolated from 27 vaginally-delivered infants were not clustered into the vaginal group. Most of them spent more than 24 hours in the delivery room and this led to repeated sterilization procedures. We hypothesized that repeated sterilization might have influenced oral microflora in those cases. To conclude, this study suggested that different modes of birth delivery affect oral microflora in healthy infants. In addition, attention shall be paid to the clinical practice of repeated sterilization of the vulva that possibly obstructs the colonization of vaginal bacterial.",

We examined WASH characteristics among households with and without HIV-positive residents enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in rural Western Kenya. Using univariable logistic regression, we examined differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative households in regard to WASH practices. Among HIV-positive households, we explored the relationship between the length of time knowing their HIV status and GEMS enrollment. No statistically significant differences were apparent in the WASH characteristics among HIV-positive and HIV-negative households. However, we found differences in the WASH characteristics among HIV-positive households who were aware of their HIV status >/= 30 days before enrollment compared with HIV-positive households who found out their status < 30 days before enrollment or thereafter. Significantly more households aware of their HIV-positive status before enrollment reported treating their drinking water (odds ratio [OR] confidence interval [CI]: 2.34 [1.12, 4.86]) and using effective water treatment methods (OR [CI]: 9.6 [3.09, 29.86]), and had better drinking water storage practices. This suggests that within this region of Kenya, HIV programs are effective in promoting the importance of practicing positive WASH-related behaviors among PLHIV.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the faecal carriage of optrA-positive enterococci among asymptomatic healthy humans in Hangzhou, China, and to characterize the genetic context of optrA. METHODS: A total of 3458 stool samples from healthy individuals were collected and cultured on a selective medium containing 10 mg/L florfenicol and resulting enterococci were screened for the presence of optrA by PCR. OptrA variants were determined by amino acid sequence comparison with the original OptrA from Enterococcus faecalis E349. Whole genome sequencing and PCR mapping were performed to obtain and analyse the genetic environment of optrA. RESULTS: Similar optrA carriage rates ( approximately 3.5%) were detected in samples from adults (55/1558) and children (66/1900). Linezolid resistance rates for E. faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and other Enterococcus species were 58.5% (38/65), 42.3% (11/26) and 0% (0/31), respectively. Nineteen OptrA variants exhibiting different linezolid MICs were identified. Isolates carrying wild-type OptrA and variants RDK, KLDP, KD, D, RDKP, and EDP generally demonstrated linezolid MICs >/=8 mg/L. The OptrA variants, with fexA upstream and erm(A) downstream, were flanked by IS1216E at one or both ends. The fexA-optrA(wild-type) was located downstream of a Tn554 transposon, and was inserted into the radC gene. The EDM variant was detected in 31/73 enterococci with linezolid MICs </=4 mg/L. Despite the variable genetic context, Tn558-araC-optrA(EDM)-erm(A)-met was the most common gene array. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a correlation between linezolid MIC, genetic context and OptrA variant. Intestinal colonization of healthy individuals by optrA-positive enterococci is a concern, and active epidemiological surveillance of optrA is warranted.",

			"abstract": "Enteric viruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young children and a significant public health problem globally. Hospital admissions of children under 5 years of age with diarrhea are primarily associated with group A rotavirus (RVA) infection. In this retrospective study, the population structure of viruses linked to AGE etiology in young children hospitalized with AGE in Moscow was evaluated, and molecular characterization of RVA strains was performed. Fecal specimens were collected from children under 5 years old hospitalized with AGE between 2009 and 2014 in Moscow, Russia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR was used to detect enteric viruses and for G/[P]-genotyping of isolated RVAs. Sequencing of RVA VP7 and VP4 cDNA fragments was used to validate the data obtained by PCR-genotyping. The main causes for hospitalization of children with AGE were RVA (40.1%), followed by noroviruses (11.4%), while adenoviruses, astroviruses, sapoviruses, enteroviruses, and orthoreoviruses were detected in 4.7%, 1.9%, 1.4%, 1.2%, and 0.2% of samples tested, respectively. Nosocomial infections, predominantly associated with RVAs and noroviruses, were detected in 24.8% of cases and occurred significantly more frequently in younger infants. The predominant RVA genotype was G4P[8], detected in 38.7% of RVA-positive cases, whereas genotypes G1P[8], G9P[8], G3P[8], and G2P[4] were found in 11.8%, 6.6%, 4.2%, and 3.3% of cases, respectively. Together, the presence of circulating RVA strains with rare VP7 and VP4 gene variants (G6 and P[9]) highlights the need to conduct continuous epidemiological monitoring of RVA infection.",

The average mortality risk for uranium isotopes (234)U, (235)U, and (238)U are 2.6 x 10(-12), 3.5 x 10(-10), and 5.9 x 10(-8), respectively.

The 764 identified metabolites identified six pathways that differ between cases and controls. We pursued sphingolipid metabolism because cases had decreased ceramides and increased sphingomyelins compared to controls, and because of the relevance of sphingolipids to human inflammatory disorders. Targeted analysis of samples from 23 cases and 46 controls confirmed the initial broad range observations. While metabolites provided only 73% accuracy of classification by machine learning, hierarchical clustering defined a sphingolipid associated grouping that contained 60% of the cases but only 13% of the controls, possibly identifying a pathophysiologically distinct subset of NEC. The clustering did not associate with any of the analyzed clinical and sample variables.

In China, the universal immunization of children with the rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced, and the two globally distributed vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) are not licensed in the country. We aim to determine the prevalence and strain diversity of rotavirus in children with diarrhea aged </= five years across China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sentinel-based surveillance of acute diarrhea was conducted at 213 participating hospitals in China from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2015. Group A rotavirus (RVA) was tested by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and G- and P-genotype of RVA were tested by RT-PCR methods. RESULTS: Of 33,616 children with diarrhea, 10,089 (30%) were positive for RVA; RVA-associated diarrhea was identified in 2247 (39.5%, n\u202f=\u202f2247/5685) inpatients and 7842 (28.1%, n\u202f=\u202f7842/27931) outpatients. Children living in low-middle-income regions suffered from the highest burden of rotavirus, with 40.7% of diarrhea cases attributed to rotavirus infection, followed by 31.3% in upper-middle-income and 11.2% in high-income regions. The majority of children (88.9%, n\u202f=\u202f8976/10089) who tested positive for RVA were children aged </= 2 years. The seasonal peak of RVA was in the winter. Among all 2533 RVA strains genotyped, five strain combinations, G9P[8], G3P[8], G1P[8], G2P[4] and G3P[4], contributed to 71.3% (1807/2533) of the RVA-associated diarrhea cases. The predominant strain of RVA has rapidly evolved from G3P[8] and G1P[8] to G9P[8] in the recent years, with the proportion of G9P[8] having increased remarkably from 3.4% in 2009 to 60.9% in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of diarrhea attributed to rotavirus is high in China, highlighting the potential value of vaccination. The rapid shift of RVA strains highlights the importance of conducting rotavirus surveillance to ensure that currently marketed vaccines provide protective efficacy against the circulating strains.",

			"abstract": "Several in vitro screening tests have been used for selecting probiotic strains; however they often show low predictive value and only a limited number of strains have demonstrated functionality in vivo. The most used in vitro tests represent a very simplified version of the gut environment, especially since they do not consider the accompanying microbiota. Therefore, there is a need to develop sensitive and discriminating in vitro models including the microbiota. Here we developed an in vitro model to discriminate among microbiotas/fecal waters from different population groups. To this end samples were obtained from seven healthy adults, five IBD-patients, ten full-term and ten preterm newborns. Fecal microbiotas were purified and their impact, as well as that of the fecal waters, on HT29 cells was continuously monitored for 22\u202fh using a real-time cell analyzer (RTCA). The composition of the purified microbiotas was assessed by 16S rRNA gene profiling and qPCR and the levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) determined by gas chromatography. The microbiota fractions and SCFA concentrations obtained from IBD-patients, full-term and preterm babies, showed clear differences with regard to those of the control group (healthy adults). Moreover, the purified intestinal microbiotas and fecal waters also differed from the control group in the response induced on the HT29 cells assay developed. In short, we have developed a real-time, impedance-based in vitro model for assessing the functional response induced by purified microbiotas and fecal waters upon intestinal epithelial cells. The capability of the assay for discriminating the functional responses induced, by microbiotas or fecal waters from different human groups, promises to be of help on the search for compounds/strains to restore the functionality of the microbiota-host's interaction.",

We compared bacterial strains across and within families in a prospective birth cohort of 44 infants and their mothers, sampled longitudinally in the first months of each child's life. We identified mother-to-child bacterial transmission events and describe the incidence of family-specific antibiotic resistance genes. We observed two inheritance patterns across multiple species, where often the mother's dominant strain is transmitted to the child, but occasionally her secondary strains colonize the infant gut. In families where the secondary strain of B. uniformis was inherited, a starch utilization gene cluster that was absent in the mother's dominant strain was identified in the child, suggesting the selective advantage of a mother's secondary strain in the infant gut. Our findings reveal mother-to-child bacterial transmission events at high resolution and give insights into early colonization of the infant gut.",

			"abstract": "Noroviruses constitute the leading cause of acute, nonbacterial gastroenteritis that affects both children and adults in healthcare and community settings. The current study attempted to provide insight on the molecular epidemiology of noroviruses in children in South Greece. Genotypic characterization of 69 norovirus strains detected in stool samples from children with gastroenteritis during a period of 30 months (January 2013 to June 2015) was performed on the basis of ORF2 (VP1 capsid) gene sequences. The results revealed the circulation of a diverse variety of norovirus genotypes. GII.4 was the predominant genotype (74%), followed by GII.2 (8.7%), GII.3 (5.8%), GII.6 (2.9%), GI.2 (2.9%), and four strains identified as GII.1, GII.7, GII.8, and GII.13, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the strains were closely associated with norovirus strains that circulated globally either in outbreaks and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis or in the environment during the last 4 years. Omicronf the GII.4 strains, 80.4% were detected between January 2013 and February 2014, indicating a possible ongoing epidemic. The incidence of other genotypes remained constant throughout the study period. Genotypic and phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of the \"Sydney 2012\" variant among the GII.4 strains, whereas one GII.4 strain was identified as a \"New Orleans 2009\" variant. Five GII.4 strains showed significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence from either the \"Sydney 2012\" or the \"New Orleans 2009\" variant, and these divergent strains might represent an emerging GII.4 variant.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome has an important role in infant health and immune development and may be affected by early-life exposures. Maternal diet may influence the infant gut microbiome through vertical transfer of maternal microbes to infants during vaginal delivery and breastfeeding. We aimed to examine the association of maternal diet during pregnancy with the infant gut microbiome 6 weeks post-delivery in mother-infant dyads enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Infant stool samples were collected from 145 infants, and maternal prenatal diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. We used targeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4-V5 hypervariable region to characterize infant gut microbiota. To account for differences in baseline and trajectories of infant gut microbial profiles, we stratified analyses by delivery mode. RESULTS: We identified three infant gut microbiome clusters, characterized by increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus and Clostridium, and Bacteroides, respectively, overall and in the vaginally delivered infant stratum. In the analyses stratified to infants born vaginally and adjusted for other potential confounders, maternal fruit intake was associated with infant gut microbial community structure (PERMANOVA, p < 0.05). In multinomial logistic regression analyses, increased fruit intake was associated with an increased odds of belonging to the high Streptococcus/Clostridium group among infants born vaginally (OR (95% CI) = 2.73 (1.36, 5.46)). In infants delivered by Cesarean section, we identified three clusters that differed slightly from vaginally delivered infants, which were characterized by a high abundance of Bifidobacterium, high Clostridium and low Streptococcus and Ruminococcus genera, and high abundance of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Maternal dairy intake was associated with an increased odds of infants belonging to the high Clostridium cluster in infants born by Cesarean section (OR (95% CI) = 2.36 (1.05, 5.30)). Linear models suggested additional associations between maternal diet and infant intestinal microbes in both delivery mode strata. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome and that these effects differ by delivery mode.",

			"abstract": "Worldwide, norovirus (NoV) is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) responsible for pandemics every ~3 years, and over 200,000 deaths per year, with the majority in children from developing countries. We investigate the incidence of NoV in children hospitalized with AGE from Belem, Para, Brazil, and also correlated viral RNA levels in their blood and stool with clinical severity. For this purpose, paired stool and serum samples were collected from 445 pediatric patients, </=9 years between March 2012 and June 2015. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) was used to detect NoV in stool and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) used to quantify NoV RNA levels in sera (RNAemia) and in the positive stool. Positives samples were characterized by the partial ORF1/2 region sequence of viral genome. NoV antigen was detected in 24.3% (108/445) of stool samples, with RNAemia also present in 20.4% (22/108). RNAemia and a high stool viral load (>107 genome copies/gram of faeces) were associated with longer hospitalizations. The prevalent genotypes were GII.4 Sydney_2012 (71.6%-58/81) and New Orleans_2009 (6.2%-5/81) variants. Eight other genotypes belonging to GII were detected and four of them were recombinant strains. All sera were characterized as GII.4 and shared 100% similarity with their stool. The results suggest that the dissemination of NoV to the blood stream is not uncommon and may be related to increased faecal viral loads and disease severity.",

There are more than 20 types of enterovirus causing HFMD, of which coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) are the most common. This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of HFMD caused by EV71 and CA16 in Linyi, Shandong province, China, from 2009 to 2017. The stool specimens and throat samples of 5,324 patients with HFMD were obtained for nucleic acid detection of enterovirus. A total of 4,040 HFMD cases were caused by viral pathogens. Of these, 1,706 cases were positive for EV71 and 1,266 were positive for CA16. These 2 virus strains appeared alternately in Linyi city. The incidence of EV71-positive and CA16-positive cases was highest in children aged 0-5 years, with male patients being predominant. This outbreak of HMFD caused by EV71 and CA16 mainly occurred between April and July and appeared alternately between the years 2011 and 2017. These results demonstrated that the epidemiological analysis of EV71 and CA16 can provide a scientific basis for the prevention and treatment of the disease.",

Previous literature indicates that different ethnicities mature at different rates. AIM: To compare the rate of meconium stained amniotic fluid of Australian-born and non-Australian born women. METHODS: A retrospective correlation study design was implemented, using data collected in the birth outcomes system at one tertiary hospital. Data was collected from all women who gave birth to a term (>/=37 weeks gestation), singleton, liveborn baby between January 1st to December 31st, 2014. Maternal country of birth was used for comparison. Categorical data was analyzed using Chi-Square test for Independence. Continuous variables were assessed for normality, and differences were compared using an Independent t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test. All tests were two-tailed and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 3,041 women were included; 1131 Australian-born and 1910 non-Australian born. Meconium stained amniotic fluid occurred more frequently in non-Australian born women compared to Australian-born women (23.5% vs. 19.8 p=0.02). Their babies were significantly smaller (Mean=3265g, Standard Deviation 463.8 vs Mean=3442g, Standard Deviation 499.2, p<0.001), with no difference in gestational length (Mean=39.4, Standard Deviation 1.28 vs Mean=39.5, Standard Deviation 1.18, p=0.06). Increasing gestational age had the strongest association with meconium stained amniotic fluid; >/=42 weeks gestation occurring 3.52 (95% Confidence Interval: 2.00, 6.22, p=<0.001) more than <40 weeks gestation. CONCLUSION: Maternity health services should record ethnicity and region of birth to provide individualised care as women born overseas often have poorer perinatal outcomes when compared to Australian-born women.",

			"abstract": "On 20 June 2015, a cholera outbreak affecting more than 30 people was reported in a fishing village, Katwe, in Kasese District, south-western Uganda. We investigated this outbreak to identify the mode of transmission and to recommend control measures. We defined a suspected case as onset of acute watery diarrhoea between 1 June and 15 July 2015 in a resident of Katwe village; a confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio cholerae cultured from stool. For case finding, we reviewed medical records and actively searched for cases in the community. In a case-control investigation we compared exposure histories of 32 suspected case-persons and 128 age-matched controls. We also conducted an environmental assessment on how the exposures had occurred. We found 61 suspected cases (attack rate = 4.9/1000) during this outbreak, of which eight were confirmed. The primary case-person had onset on 16 June; afterwards cases sharply increased, peaked on 19 June, and rapidly declined afterwards. After 22 June, eight scattered cases occurred. The case-control investigation showed that 97% (31/32) of cases and 62% (79/128) of controls usually collected water from inside a water-collection site \"X\" (ORM-H = 16; 95% CI = 2.4-107). The primary case-person who developed symptoms while fishing, reportedly came ashore in the early morning hours on 17 June, and defecated \"near\" water-collection site X. We concluded that this cholera outbreak was caused by drinking lake water collected from inside the lakeshore water-collection site X. At our recommendations, the village administration provided water chlorination tablets to the villagers, issued water boiling advisory to the villagers, rigorously disinfected all patients' faeces and, three weeks later, fixed the tap-water system.",

The aim of this hospital-based sentinel surveillance was to study the prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections and to describe rotavirus genotype distribution patterns among children under five years of age hospitalized for acute watery diarrhea during the period of 2009-2016. METHODS: Prospective, sentinel hospital-based surveillance was conducted in Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) from 2009 to 2016. Stool samples of children admitted with acute watery diarrhea were tested by rotavirus antigen detection 'ProSpecT' Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) at Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Colombo. Specimens that tested positive for rotavirus were further analyzed at the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) participating in the World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network (GRSN) to determine the genotype of strains by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of the 6090 children with diarrhea admitted, 1801 (29.5%) had stools taken and tested. In years with at least 11\u202fmonths of data (2010 and 2013) rotavirus was detected in 36.5% (228/624) of specimens. Genotype G1P[8] was the most common genotype detected throughout the surveillance period (30.1%; 123/408) with G2P [8], G9P[8] and G3P[8] also detected. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus is a common cause of pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations in Sri Lanka. National introduction of rotavirus vaccine could reduce the burden of pediatric diarrhea.",

			"abstract": "Although endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs, including pesticides) are thought to increase the risk of hypospadias, no compounds have been formally identified in this context. Human studies may now be possible via the assessment of meconium as a marker of chronic prenatal exposure. The objective of the present study was to determine whether or not prenatal exposure to pesticides (as detected in meconium) constitutes a risk factor for isolated hypospadias. In a case-control study performed between 2011 and 2014 in northern France, male newborns with isolated hypospadias (n\u202f=\u202f25) were matched at birth with controls (n\u202f=\u202f58). Newborns with obvious genetic or hormonal anomalies, undescended testis, micropenis, a congenital syndrome or a family history of hypospadias were not included. Neonatal and parental data were collected. Foetal exposure was assessed by determining the meconium concentrations of the pesticides or metabolites (organophosphates, carbamates, phenylurea, and phenoxyherbicides) most commonly used in the region. Risk factors were assessed in a multivariate analysis. The pesticides most commonly detected in meconium were organophosphates (in up to 98.6% of samples, depending on the substance) and phenylurea (>85.5%). A multivariate analysis revealed an association between isolated hypospadias and the presence in meconium of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon and of the phenoxyherbicide 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 5.94 [1.03-34.11] and 4.75 [1.20-18.76]) respectively). We conclude that prenatal exposure to these two herbicides (as assessed by meconium analysis) was correlated with the occurrence of isolated hypospadias. The results of our case-control study (i) suggest that prenatal exposure to pesticides interferes with the development of the male genitalia, and (ii) emphasize the importance of preventing pregnant women from being exposed to EDCs in general and pesticides in particular.",

			"article_name": "The developing premature infant gut microbiome is a major factor shaping the microbiome of neonatal intensive care unit rooms.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) contains a unique cohort of patients with underdeveloped immune systems and nascent microbiome communities. Patients often spend several months in the same room, and it has been previously shown that the gut microbiomes of these infants often resemble the microbes found in the NICU. Little is known, however, about the identity, persistence, and absolute abundance of NICU room-associated bacteria over long stretches of time. Here, we couple droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), 16S rRNA gene surveys, and recently published metagenomics data from infant gut samples to infer the extent to which the NICU microbiome is shaped by its room occupants. RESULTS: Over 2832 swabs, wipes, and air samples were collected from 16 private-style NICU rooms housing very low birth weight (< 1500 g), premature (< 31 weeks' gestation) infants. For each infant, room samples were collected daily, Monday through Friday, for 1 month. The first samples from the first infant and the last samples from the last infant were collected 383 days apart. Twenty-two NICU locations spanning room surfaces, hands, electronics, sink basins, and air were collected. Results point to an incredibly simple room community where 5-10 taxa, mostly skin-associated, account for over 50% of the amplicon reads. Biomass estimates reveal four to five orders of magnitude difference between the least to the most dense microbial communities, air, and sink basins, respectively. Biomass trends from bioaerosol samples and petri dish dust collectors suggest occupancy to be a main driver of suspended biological particles within the NICU. Using a machine learning algorithm to classify the origin of room samples, we show that each room has a unique microbial fingerprint. Several important taxa driving this model were dominant gut colonizers of infants housed within each room. CONCLUSIONS: Despite regular cleaning of hospital surfaces, bacterial biomass was detectable at varying densities. A room-specific microbiome signature was detected, suggesting microbes seeding NICU surfaces are sourced from reservoirs within the room and that these reservoirs contain actively dividing cells. Collectively, the data suggests that hospitalized infants, in combination with their caregivers, shape the microbiome of NICU rooms.",

Commensal bacteria, an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes, facilitate the spread of such genes to pathogenic bacterial strains. The objective of the study is to investigate the fecal carriage of MDR E. coli and ST131 E. coli in community children in Southern Taiwan. METHODS: In this prospective study, stool samples from children aged 0-18 years were obtained within 3 days of hospitalization from October 2013 to September 2014. Children with a history of underlying diseases, antibiotic treatment, or hospitalization in the 3 months before specimen collection were excluded. E. coli colonies were selected and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, and O25b-ST131, multilocus sequence typing, and blaCTX-M gene groups were detected. RESULTS: Among 157 E. coli isolates, the rates of nonsusceptibility to ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cefazolin were 70, 65.6, 47.1, and 32.5%, respectively. Twenty-nine (18.5%) isolates were nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin. MDR E. coli accounted for 58 (37%) of all isolates. Thirteen (8.3%) isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Furthermore, 26 (16.6%) and 13 (8.3%) isolates were O25b and ST131 positive, respectively. Five (38.5%) of the 13 ESBL-producing E. coli belonged to blaCTX-M group 9, among which were CTXM-14 and 4 (80%) were O25b-ST131 positive. Compared with the non-ESBL and ciprofloxacin-susceptible groups, the ESBL and ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible groups showed significantly higher rates of O25b-ST131 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the fecal carriage of nonsusceptible E. coli in children was high; among these E. coli, 37% were MDR, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin, and 8.3% produced ESBL.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Palmitate in breast milk is predominantly located in the triacylglycerol sn-2 position, while infant formulae contain palmitate predominantly in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions. During digestion, palmitate in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions is hydrolyzed to free palmitic acid that can subsequently complex with calcium to form insoluble soaps; this may partially explain why formula-fed infants have harder stools than breast-fed infants. METHODS: This large (n = 488) randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial investigated whether increasing the sn-2 palmitate content of infant formula improves stool consistency and bone mineral content (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), without affecting growth or health. From  approximately 1 week to 4 months of age, infants were exclusively fed one of three formulae: i) control formula (CF; 16% of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 162), (ii) experimental formula 1 (EF1; 43% of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 166) or (iii) experimental formula 2 (EF2; 51% of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 160). RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed softer stools in both EF groups (vs. CF) at ages 2 weeks and 1 and 2 months (p </= 0.01), but not 3 and 4 months. At 4 months, all groups had similar growth outcomes while bone mineral content was significantly higher in EF1 (p = 0.0012) and EF2 (p = 0.0002) compared with CF. Comparison of reported adverse events up to 12 months revealed no differences among groups. All 3 infant formulae exhibited equally good digestive tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Formulae enriched in sn-2 palmitate fed in early infancy are safe, improve stool consistency (from 2 weeks to 2 months) and increase bone mineral content (at 4 months).",

This study investigated the burden of cryptosporidiosis and its impact on child growth in both a rural and an urban site in Bangladesh. METHODS: Pregnant women in the second trimester were identified at 2 sites in Bangladesh, 1 urban and 1 rural. Their offspring were enrolled at birth into the study (urban, n = 250; rural, n = 258). For 2 years, the children were actively monitored for diarrhea and anthropometric measurements were obtained every 3 months. Stool samples were collected monthly and during diarrheal episodes with Cryptosporidium infection and causative species determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Cryptosporidium infections were common at both sites and mostly subclinical. In the urban site, 161 (64%) children were infected and 65 (26%) had >/=2 infections. In the rural site, 114 (44%) were infected and 24 (9%) had multiple infections. Adjusted for potential confounders, cryptosporidiosis was associated with a significantly greater drop in the length-for-age z score (LAZ) at 24 months from LAZ at enrollment (Delta-LAZ), an effect greatest in the children with multiple episodes of cryptosporidiosis. The most common species in Mirpur was Cryptosporidium hominis, whereas Cryptosporidium meleagridis predominated in Mirzapur. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidiosis is common in early childhood and associated with early growth faltering in Bangladeshi children. Predominant Cryptosporidium species differed between the 2 sites, suggesting different exposures or modes of transmission but similar consequences for child growth.

			"article_name": "Impact and Time Course of Clostridium difficile Colonization in Very Low Birth Weight Infants.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic spore-forming, toxin-producing bacillus, which is one of the most common causes for health care-associated infections. High colonization rates in clinically asymptomatic neonates and infants have been described, although most studies go back to the early 1980 and 1990s, and were carried out in term and late preterm infants. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine both the impact and time course of C. difficile colonization in a cohort of very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) in an era of PCR-based technologies for diagnosis. METHODS: Stool samples of VLBWI were analyzed for the presence of C. difficile strains in regular intervals during the hospital stay by PCR ribotyping. Analysis was continued throughout the first 2 years of life. RESULTS: A 32% C. difficile colonization rate during the first 2 years of life and an in-hospital colonization rate of 8% was found in a cohort of 190 VLBWI. C. difficile colonization occurred mainly in the first 6 months of life, which was similar to term neonates. In-hospital colonization accounted for only a small percentage of cases with no detection of hypervirulent strains. Also, C. difficile colonization was not related to an adverse outcome in this VLBWI cohort. Oral lactoferrin of bovine origin and treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam were negatively correlated with C. difficile colonization in our study. CONCLUSIONS: C. difficile colonization in our cohort of VLBWI was significantly lower than has been described in the literature and was not related to an adverse outcome.",

			"article_name": "Association of Fecal Markers of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction with Zinc and Iron Status among Children at First Two Years of Life in Bangladesh.",
			"abstract": "Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) causes gut inflammation and increased intestinal permeability leading to deficiencies in micronutrients such as zinc and iron. Fecal markers such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), neopterin (NEO), and alpha-1-anti-trypsin (AAT) can predict EED. The aim of this study was to examine the association between fecal markers of EED with zinc and iron status among children at first 2 years of life. Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Study Bangladeshi birth cohort data were used to conduct this analysis. Multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations were performed to test the association between individual fecal markers with zinc or iron status of the children. A total of 265 children were enrolled in the study (male:female = 1:1). Of the 627 stool samples collected (N = 222 children), 535, 511, and 577 were accompanied by zinc, ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor values, respectively. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) values of AAT, MPO, and NEO were 0.33 (0.18-0.62) mg/g, 3,895.42 (1,563.76-8,432.82) ng/mL, and 890.81 (331.57-2,089.04) nmol/L, respectively. Overall, 60%, 71%, and 97% of samples were above the values considered normal in nontropical settings for AAT, MPO, and NEO, respectively. High AAT levels were significantly associated with low ferritin values after adjusting for age and gender (coefficient = -5.85; 95% confidence interval = -11.23 to -0.47; P value = 0.03). No such association was found between AAT and plasma zinc status. Myeloperoxidase and NEO were not associated with plasma zinc or iron status. The study results imply the importance of enteric protein loss in contributing to reduced ferritin levels at first 2 years of life.",

			"article_name": "The Microbiome and Metabolome of Preterm Infant Stool Are Personalized and Not Driven by Health Outcomes, Including Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Late-Onset Sepsis.",
			"abstract": "The assembly and development of the gut microbiome in infants have important consequences for immediate and long-term health. Preterm infants represent an abnormal case for bacterial colonization because of early exposure to bacteria and frequent use of antibiotics. To better understand the assembly of the gut microbiota in preterm infants, fecal samples were collected from 32 very low birth weight preterm infants over the first 6 weeks of life. Infant health outcomes included health, late-onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We characterized bacterial compositions by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomes by untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Preterm infant fecal samples lacked beneficial Bifidobacterium spp. and were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus organisms due to nearly uniform antibiotic administration. Most of the variance between the microbial community compositions could be attributed to the baby from which the sample derived (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA] R(2) = 0.48, P < 0.001), while clinical status (health, NEC, or late-onset sepsis) and overlapping times in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) did not explain a significant amount of variation in bacterial composition. Fecal metabolomes were also found to be unique to the individual (PERMANOVA R(2) = 0.43, P < 0.001) and weakly associated with bacterial composition (Mantel statistic r = 0.23 +/- 0.05, P < 0.05). No measured metabolites were found to be associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, or a healthy outcome. Overall, preterm infant gut microbial communities were personalized and reflected antibiotic usage.IMPORTANCE Preterm infants face health problems likely related to microbial exposures, including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the role of the gut microbiome in preterm infant health is poorly understood. Microbial colonization differs from that of healthy term babies because it occurs in the NICU and is often perturbed by antibiotics. We measured bacterial compositions and metabolomic profiles of 77 fecal samples from 32 preterm infants to investigate the differences between microbiomes in health and disease. Rather than finding microbial signatures of disease, we found that both the preterm infant microbiome and the metabolome were personalized and that the preterm infant gut microbiome is enriched in microbes that commonly dominate in the presence of antibiotics. These results contribute to the growing knowledge of the preterm infant microbiome and emphasize that a personalized view will be important to disentangle the health consequences of the preterm infant microbiome.",

			"abstract": "CONTEXT: Rotavirus diarrhea is a common disease worldwide which mostly affects children under five years old. Rotavirus infection causes severe diarrhea and leads to substantial health care costs. In Indonesia the rotavirus vaccine has been available since 2011, however it has not been included into the National Immunization Program. This study aims to describe the proportion of rotavirus in children under 5 in Indonesia, the clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections, and the rotavirus strains circulating in the country during 2010-2015. METHODS: Children under five years of age with acute watery diarrhea were prospectively identified and enrolled through the active diarrhea surveillance system in 5 sites in four provinces in Indonesia during 2010-2015. The rotavirus specimens were tested using Enzyme Immunoassay. Bivariate logistic regression tests were performed to compare rotavirus positive and negative results with respect to the collected demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: From January 2010 to December 2015, the average annual rotavirus prevalence among children hospitalized with acute watery diarrhea in four provinces in Indonesia was 47.5%. Rotavirus diarrhea occurred mostly in children under 2\u202fyears of age. Of all age groups, children aged 6-11 and 12-23\u202fmonths had the highest prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea in all years (54.2% and 50.6%, respectively). This study found that the most prevalent of G and P genotypes were G1P8 in 2010 (63.2%), 2011 (64.1%) and 2012 (74.6%) and G3P8 in 2013 (49.7%), 2014 (82.5%) and 2015 (84.4%) CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea in hospitalized children in Indonesia. These findings highlight the need for inclusion of the rotavirus vaccine to the National Immunization Program in Indonesia.",

In all, 79 pregnant women were recruited from three hospitals located in agricultural areas in Thailand. The subjects were interviewed about personal characteristics, agricultural activities and pesticide use patterns. Paraquat was analyzed in urine and meconium using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a fluorescence detector. The geometric mean (GSD) of urinary paraquat concentrations at 28 weeks of pregnancy, delivery and 2 months postpartum were 2.04 (4.22), 2.06 (5.04) and 2.42 (5.33) ng/mL, respectively. The urinary paraquat concentrations at 28 weeks of pregnancy, delivery and 2 months postpartum between agriculturist and non-agriculturist were not significantly different (p = 0.632, p = 0.915, p = 0.57 respectively). The geometric mean (GSD) of paraquat concentration in the meconium was 33.31 (4.59) ng/g. The factors predicting paraquat exposures among pregnant women and neonates included working outside, living near farmland, having family members who work on a farm, drinking well water and using herbicides or paraquat.",

			"abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate whether serial measurements of fecal calprotectin concentrations enable us to identify infants who will develop NEC prior to development of symptoms. METHODS: Prospective matched case-control study including 100 high-risk neonates. High risk includes 1) gestational age (GA) </=30\u202fweeks, 2) birth-weight (BW) </=1000\u202fg, 3) GA 30-32\u202fweeks and BW </=1250\u202fg, 4) born from a mother who received indomethacin for tocolysis. We matched every NEC subject with three controls for birth weight and gestational age. Fecal calprotectin was measured twice a week from day one until five weeks after birth or until NEC development. We analyzed differences in fecal calprotectin between NEC subjects and controls in the week preceding NEC onset and course of fecal calprotectin within subjects who developed NEC. RESULTS: Of 100 included patients, ten (median GA 27.5\u202fweeks [24.6-29.4], BW 1010\u202fg [775-1630]) developed NEC. The median calprotectin concentration in all samples combined was 332\u202fmug/g [<40-8230] mug/g feces. There were no differences between NEC subjects and controls, with a wide variation in both groups. In NEC subjects, there was no intraindividual rise in calprotectin before clinical symptoms occurred. CONCLUSIONS: There are high concentrations and wide interindividual variations in calprotectin in preterm infants during the first weeks of life. Wide intraindividual variation further precludes the serial use of fecal calprotectin in the early detection or prediction of NEC in high risk infants. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.",

			"article_name": "Genetic and epidemiological analysis of norovirus from children with gastroenteritis in Botswana, 2013-2015.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Norovirus is a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide with a peak of disease seen in children. The epidemiological analysis regarding the virus strains in Africa is limited. The first report of norovirus in Botswana was in 2010 and currently, the prevalence and circulating genotypes of norovirus are unknown, as the country has no systems to report the norovirus cases. This study investigated the prevalence, patterns and molecular characteristics of norovirus infections among children </=5 years of age admitted with acute gastroenteritis at four hospitals in Botswana. METHODS: A total of 484 faecal samples were collected from children who were admitted with acute gastroenteritis during the rotavirus vaccine impact survey between July 2013 and December 2015. Norovirus was detected using real-time RT-PCR. Positive samples were genotyped using conventional RT-PCR followed by partial sequencing of the capsid and RdRp genes. Norovirus strains were determined by nucleotide sequence analysis using the online Norovirus Genotyping Tool Version 1.0, and confirmed using maximum likelihood tree construction as implemented in MEGA 6.0. RESULTS: The prevalence of norovirus was 9.3% (95% CI 6.7-11.9). The genotype diversity was dominated by the GII.4 strain at 69.7%. This was followed by GII.2, GII.12 each at 9.1%, GI.9 at 6.6% and GII.6, GII.10 each at 3.0%. The most common combined RdRp/Capsid genotype was the GII.Pe/GII.4 Sydney 2012. Norovirus was detected during most part of the year; however, there was a preponderance of cases in the wet season (December to March). CONCLUSION: The study showed a possible decline of norovirus infections in the last 10 years since the first report. An upward trend seen between 2013 and 2015 may be attributable to the success of rotavirus vaccine introductions in 2012. Knowledge of circulating genotypes, seasonal trends and overall prevalence is critical for prevention programming and possible future vaccine design implications.",

			"article_name": "Probiotic supplementation and associated infant gut microbiome and health: a cautionary retrospective clinical comparison.",
			"abstract": "While probiotics are a multi-billion dollar industry, there is little evidence to show that supplementing infants provides any health benefits. We conducted an observational study where 35 of 86 participating mothers self-administered probiotics during breastfeeding, as well as directly to their infants. The primary objective was to determine if probiotic exposure influenced the infants' fecal microbiome while the secondary objective assessed associated changes to the mothers' breast milk immunity and infant health. Analysis of infant fecal microbiome throughout the first 6 months of life revealed that probiotics were associated with higher abundances of Bifidobacterium at week 1 only. Short-chain fatty acid production and predicted metagenomic functions of the microbial communities were not altered. While probiotics did not alter breast milk immune markers, fecal sIgA responses were higher among probiotic supplemented infants. Surprisingly, this was not associated with better health outcomes, as the probiotic cohort had higher incidences of mucosal-associated illnesses as toddlers. This retrospective clinical comparison suggests that probiotic exposure during infancy has limited effects on gut microbial composition yet is associated with increased infection later in life. These correlative findings caution against probiotic supplementation during infancy until rigorous controlled follow-up studies determining their safety and efficacy have occurred.",

			"article_name": "Quorum sensing signals and related virulence inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a potential probiotic strain's organic acid.",
			"abstract": "Studies conducted in recent years show that pathogen bacteria are not asocial assets and they use the cell to cell communication mechanism called quorum sensing that depends on population density to adapt changing environmental conditions. This mechanism is coordinate gene expression of various bacterial factors like bioluminescence, antibiotic biosynthesis, plasmid conjugation and virulence. Bacteria communicate with each other by producing signal molecules and regulate the production of virulence factors that have importance in the pathogenity formation. Virulence mechanisms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes various types of infections in humans, are also regulated by quorum sensing. Nowadays, biotechnological researches are focused on the development of homoserine lactone antagonists. The use of these type of molecules are considered to be a new treatment approach for blocking communication between bacteria and reducing virulence, therefore improving infection control. In this study, lactic acid of a potential probiotic Pediococcus acidilactici M7 strain isolated from newborn faeces was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect on quorum sensing signal molecules and some virulence factors of clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Results showed that lactic acid has an inhibitory effect on short-chain HSL production and swarming-swimming-twitching motility, elastase, protease, pyocyanin, and biofilm production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in certain quantities that are regulated by the quorum sensing system.",

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of gastroschisis patients from 2000 to 2014 at a single, tertiary institution was performed. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher exact test, Welch's t-test, logistic regression and/or linear regression with significance at p\u202f<\u202f0.05. RESULTS: Sixty-four of 135 (47.4%) gastroschisis patients had MSAF. On univariate analysis, patients with MSAF were more likely to require staged closure (30 (46.9%) vs. 18(25.4%), p\u202f=\u202f0.012), had more ventilator days (8.9\u202f+/-\u202f11.1 vs. 5.3\u202f+/-\u202f6.3, p\u202f=\u202f0.021) and longer times to commence enteral feeds (24.9\u202f+/-\u202f21.7 vs. 18.5\u202f+/-\u202f14.5, p\u202f=\u202f0.045). However, multi-variate regression analysis controlling for the type of closure, showed that delayed closure, but not MSAF, was associated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In gastroschisis patients, MSAF is associated with delayed closure but is not associated with outcomes independent of closure type. This association may be because of the matting of the bowel or increased intestinal damage. The MSAF status will aid in setting expectations for parents during their initial NICU stay and further investigation is warranted. TYPE OF STUDY: Clinical Research Paper Level of evidence: III.",

Gut colonization patterns were determined with 16S rDNA microbiome profiling. RESULTS: Gut bacterial alpha-diversity differed between premature and term infants at 6 weeks of age, after adjusting for exposures (p = 0.027). Alpha-diversity varied between extremely premature (<28 weeks gestation) and very premature infants (>/=28 but <32 weeks, p = 0.011), as well as between extremely and moderate-to-late premature infants (>/=32 and <37 weeks, p = 0.004).

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In preparation for the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine into the routine immunization program of Bangladesh in 2018, we report data and highlight evolving genotypes from five years of active hospital-based rotavirus surveillance which began in July 2012. METHODS: We enrolled and collected fresh stool from every fourth child\u202f<\u202f5\u202fyears admitted with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) at 8 participating surveillance hospitals. Rotavirus infections were detected by enzyme immune assay. Twenty-five percent of rotavirus isolates were genotyped using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found that 64% (4832/7562) of children\u202f<\u202f5\u202fyears of age admitted with AGE had evidence of rotavirus infection. The majority (57%) of patients with rotavirus infection were <12\u202fmonths of age. The most common strains were G1P[8] (43%), G12P[8] (15%) and G9P[8] (9%); 11% of children had mixed infection.G3P[8], which has not been reported in Bangladesh since 2001, was documented for the first time in our surveillance system.

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rotavirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and mortality among children worldwide but data describing rotavirus disease in Azerbaijan are lacking. This analysis describes the rotavirus disease burden in Baku, the largest city in Azerbaijan. METHODS: We conducted active, prospective, sentinel hospital surveillance with laboratory confirmation for rotavirus among children under 5\u202fyears of age hospitalized at a large pediatric hospital in Baku during 2011-2016. Children with bloody diarrhea, or prior use of antibiotics or intravenous fluids were excluded. The guardians of enrolled children completed a questionnaire documenting clinical and demographic information. A stool specimen was collected from each enrolled child. We report the number and proportion of rotavirus positive hospitalizations during the surveillance period and a clinical description of rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative children. RESULTS: From July 2011 through June 2016, 3139 children <5\u202fyears of age were enrolled into the surveillance system. Of these, 523 (17%) were positive for rotavirus, varying from 13% to 21% by surveillance year, with a median of 16% over the surveillance period. Increase in rotavirus detections occurred during December-May. Most rotavirus infections (303/523; 58%) occurred in children aged 6-23\u202fmonths. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus is responsible for approximately 16% of annual hospital admissions for acute gastroenteritis in children <5\u202fyears of age in Baku. This is lower than regional estimates. Exclusion of children with a history of antibiotic use or intravenous fluids may be accounting for this lower prevalence, and expansion of surveillance to include these groups could provide a more comprehensive picture of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in Baku.",

Of these cases, Rotavirus was most common pathogen 46.7% (4054 cases); in which 26.6% (1117) rotavirus-positive stool samples were evaluated to identify genotypes. The proportion of rotavirus positive specimens decreased annually from 54.7% in 2012 to 36.6% in 2015. Rotavirus was detected year-round, but most rotavirus gastroenteritis cases (77.1%) occurred between December and May, corresponding to the rotavirus seasonality. It is found that the peaks varied by regions. Rotavirus positivities varied between the youngest and oldest age, but children 6-11\u202fmonths old (38.8%) and 12-23\u202fmonths old (38.4%) counted for most cases. A significant higher number of diarrhea within 24\u202fhours (8.3 times, 95%CI: 8.1-8.4 times) and higher proportion of severe dehydration (12.9%) in Rotavirus positive group than that in Rotavirus negative group (7.7 times, 95%CI: 7.6-7.9 times; and 9.7%, respectively). A downtrend of prevalence of G1P[8] was observed from 82% in 2013 to 15% in 2015. However, G2P[4] was found in 5% of samples in 2012, 9% in 2013, 36% in 2014, and 28% in 2015. Rotavirus infection is the most important cause of acute diarrhea among hospitalized children in Vietnam, and a rotavirus vaccination program for children may significantly reduce this disease.",

			"abstract": "An unexpected increase in gastroenteritis cases was reported by healthcare workers on the KwaZulu-Natal Coast, South Africa, January 2017 with >600 cases seen over a 3-week period. A case-control study was conducted to identify the source and risk factors associated with the outbreak so as to recommend control and prevention measures. Record review identified cases and controls and structured-telephonic interviews were conducted to obtain exposure history. Stool specimens were collected from 20 cases along with environmental samples and both screened for enteric pathogens. A total of 126 cases and 62 controls were included in the analysis. The odds of developing gastroenteritis were 6.0 times greater among holiday makers than residents (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-17.7). Swimming in the lagoon increased the odds of developing gastroenteritis by 3.3 times (95% CI 1.06-10.38). Lagoon water samples tested positive for norovirus (NoV) GI.6, GII.3 and GII.6, astrovirus and rotavirus. Eleven (55%) stool specimens were positive for NoV with eight genotyped as GI.1 (n = 2), GI.5 (n = 3), GI.6 (n = 2), and GI.7 (n = 1). A reported sewage contamination event impacting the lagoon was the likely source with person-to-person spread perpetuating the outbreak. Restriction to swimming in the lagoon was apparently ineffective at preventing the outbreak, possibly due to inadequate enforcement, communication and signage strategies.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Rotaviruses are the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal disease in young children. However, little is known about the epidemiological and clinical profile of rotavirus A (RVA) in diarrhoeal children or the efficacy of Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine (LLR) in Chengdu, China. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical profile of RVA in diarrhoeal children and provide gene analysis information for RVA vaccination programmes. METHODS: A total of 1121 faecal samples were collected from outpatient children with diarrhoea between 2009 and 2014. RT-PCR was performed to detect RVA infection and other gastroenteritis viruses. VP4 and VP7 genes of 13 RVA strains were sequenced to compare their similarity with vaccine strains. RESULTS: The overall RVA infection rate was 17.48%. G1 (54.72%) and G3 (18.87%) were the predominant G genotypes; P[8] (72.36%) and P[4] (11.38%) were the main P genotypes. Sixteen genotypes were identified; G1P[8] (57.33%) and G9P[8] (12.00%) were the most prevalent. The proportion of coinfection with RVA and other gastroenteritis viruses was 18.88%. RVA was mostly detected in winter and in diarrhoeal children 1-2 years of age. The genotypes of Rotarix and RotaTeq vaccines were consistent with RVA strains prevalent in Sichuan and shared high identity. CONCLUSIONS: RVA was one of the major aetiological agents of diarrhoeal children in Chengdu. Genotype distribution differed within each year and the gene analysis implied low efficacy of LLR. Continuous epidemiological monitoring of RVA is essential for the national vaccination programme.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improper disposal of child faeces is a major source of faecal pathogens that cause diarrhoeal disease. However, this has received relatively less attention in sanitation evaluation literature, which has tended to focus on sanitation provision, implicitly assuming that child faeces disposal behaviour also improves with sanitation. We examined the impact of improved sanitation without safe disposal (households with improved sanitation but not disposing of child faeces in improved sanitation) and improved sanitation with safe disposal (households with improved sanitation and disposal of child faeces in improved sanitation) on diarrhoeal prevalence in rural Nepal. METHODS: Data from the Nepal Demographic Health Survey 2011 for 3377 children <5 y of age were used to answer the research question using quasi-experimental methods. RESULTS: Improved sanitation with safe disposal was associated with a 3.3 percentage point (standard error [SE] 0.016) to 6.6 percentage point (SE 0.023) lower prevalence of diarrhoea among children <5 y of age compared with matched households without access to improved sanitation. No effect was observed for households having improved sanitation without safe disposal compared with matched households without access to improved sanitation. Improved sanitation with safe disposal was also associated with a 4.0 percentage point (SE 0.023) lower prevalence of diarrhoea in low economic status households (bottom two quintiles). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that sanitation programmes need to focus on behavioural interventions as well as increasing access to sanitation facilities.",

In sub-Saharan Africa, the disease affects over 250 million people with nearly 800 million are at risk. In Ethiopia, Schistosoma mansoni is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and identify the determinant factors of Schistosoma mansoni, in terms of some socio-demographic variables and risk factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional parasitological survey was conducted at Sanja health center, northwest Ethiopia from June 1 to June 30, 2015. A total of 228 study participants were included in the study. The participants were selected using systematic random sampling technique. Stool specimens were collected and examined using Kato-Katz methods. Structural questionnaires were used to collect data on socio-demographic variables and risk factors by face to face interviews. The major risk factors and demographic determinants of the infection status of Schistosoma mansoni were identified by using descriptive and ordinal logistic regression techniques. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was 16.67% (95%CI: 11.83-21.51%). Covariates such as no habit of swimming in rivers has lower risk (AOR = 0.022: 95%CI: 0.011-0.764), no frequency of swimming in rivers (AOR = 0.022: 95%CI: 0.0024-0.207), and 1 to 2 frequency of swimming (OR = 0.302: 95%CI: 0.097-0.941), washing clothes in rivers (AOR = 0.194: 95%CI: 0.046-0.0.811) and bathing in the river (AOR = 0.09: 95%CI: 0.010-0.815) were the most important determinant factors (P-value < 0.5) of Schistosoma mansoni in Sanja health center. CONCLUSION: In this study, the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was found to be high. Swimming habits, frequency of swimming, washing clothes, and bathing in rivers were found to be significant predictors of Schistosoma mansoni. Provisions of a safe water supply in the area and health education about the transmission of the Schistosoma mansoni infection are required.",

A total of 1716 stool samples, collected from children with clinical suspicion of bacterial and/or viral gastroenteritis attending the University Hospital of Parma, was submitted to the FA-GP and, when an adequate aliquot was available, to electron microscopy (n\u202f=\u202f1163) for virus detection and to an enterovirus-targeting real-time PCR (n\u202f=\u202f1703). Specimens with positive results for Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli/Shigella, Campylobacter, Plesiomonas shigelloides and/or parasites by the FA-GP were also submitted to conventional diagnostic methods. The FA-GP gave positive results in 958 (55.8%) cases, 64.8% from inpatients: 647 (67.5%) contained a single agent and 311 (32.5%) multiple agents, for a total of 1374 pathogens. Enteropathogenic E. coli, rotavirus, norovirus, toxigenic Clostridioides difficile, and sapovirus were the most commonly detected pathogens. A total of 812 additional agents (344 of which as single pathogen) was detected by the FA-GP and not included in the clinical suspicion. The overall recovery rate of the conventional methods from stools that resulted positive by the FA-GP was 38.6% for bacteria, 50% and 84.2% for Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium, respectively, and ranged from 3.7% to 64.6% for viruses, if excluding all electron microscopy-negative astroviruses. Enterovirus, an agent not targeted by the FA-GP, was revealed in 9.6% (164/1703) of the examined samples, and in 52 cases it was the only agent detected. The results of this study allowed to extend the range of detectable pathogens independently of the clinical suspicion, to detect co-infections in almost one third of children positive for at least one agent and to show that conventional methods would have missed more than half of the enteric agents detected by the FA-GP.",

We sought to create stool calprotectin reference ranges in preterm neonates and to evaluate whether levels exceeding the upper reference interval are diagnostic for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). STUDY DESIGN: Stool calprotectin was measured in premature neonates without gastrointestinal pathology to create reference intervals. For comparison, levels from infants undergoing \"rule out NEC\" evaluations were plotted on these reference intervals. RESULTS: Stool calprotectin reference intervals were created according to gestational age at birth and corrected gestational age. Levels during \"rule out NEC\" evaluations were more often above the upper reference interval with NEC vs. those without NEC. CONCLUSIONS: Stools from preterm neonates have a higher range of calprotectin than stools from healthy term neonates. In evaluating preterm neonates for NEC with stool calprotectin, a calprotectin upper reference interval that incorporates corrected gestational age best predicts the diagnosis of NEC.",

This evaluation tracks the epidemiologic patterns and most common rotavirus genotypes among hospitalized children in this age group with acute gastroenteritis in Lao PDR. METHODS: Children <5\u202fyears in a central tertiary hospital in the capital city were prospectively enrolled into the surveillance platform during January 2009-December 2015. We collected information regarding clinical characteristics of enrolled children. Stool samples were obtained within 24\u202fh of hospital admission and tested for rotavirus using rotavirus antigen detection enzyme immunoassay. Samples were sent to the regional reference laboratories in Australia and South Korea for genotyping. Bivariate analyses compared demographic and clinical characteristics between rotavirus positive and negative children using Chi-square statistical testing. Seasonality of rotavirus and annual genotype distribution are also described. RESULTS: We enrolled 1853 children <5\u202fyears with acute gastroenteritis during the surveillance period and collected 1772 fecal specimens, 982 (55%) of which tested positive for rotavirus. A higher proportion of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis was observed among children 12-23\u202fmonths of age as compared to rotavirus negative children in the same age group, 41% vs 36%. Eighty-six percent of rotavirus positive children experienced vomiting, as compared to 65% of rotavirus negative children. Eighty-five percent (n\u202f=\u202f830/982) of rotavirus positive specimens occurred during the dry season (January-April). The most common genotypes identified were G1, G2, G3 and P8 and P4. The most prevalent combined genotype differed annually during the surveillance period. CONCLUSION: Surveillance continues to be important in documenting the burden of rotavirus in children <5\u202fyears in Lao PDR as well as providing a baseline for determining the impact of rotavirus vaccine once it is introduced into Lao PDR's national immunization schedule.",

The disease continues to plague Yemen today in what has become the largest documented cholera epidemic of modern times. We aimed to describe the key epidemiological features of this epidemic, including the drivers of cholera transmission during the outbreak. METHODS: The Yemen Health Authorities set up a national cholera surveillance system to collect information on suspected cholera cases presenting at health facilities. Individual variables included symptom onset date, age, severity of dehydration, and rapid diagnostic test result. Suspected cholera cases were confirmed by culture, and a subset of samples had additional phenotypic and genotypic analysis. We first conducted descriptive analyses at national and governorate levels. We divided the epidemic into three time periods: the first wave (Sept 28, 2016, to April 23, 2017), the increasing phase of the second wave (April 24, 2017, to July 2, 2017), and the decreasing phase of the second wave (July 3, 2017, to March 12, 2018). We reconstructed the changes in cholera transmission over time by estimating the instantaneous reproduction number, R(t). Finally, we estimated the association between rainfall and the daily cholera incidence during the increasing phase of the second epidemic wave by fitting a spatiotemporal regression model. FINDINGS: From Sept 28, 2016, to March 12, 2018, 1 103 683 suspected cholera cases (attack rate 3.69%) and 2385 deaths (case fatality risk 0.22%) were reported countrywide. The epidemic consisted of two distinct waves with a surge in transmission in May, 2017, corresponding to a median R(t) of more than 2 in 13 of 23 governorates. Microbiological analyses suggested that the same Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa strain circulated in both waves. We found a positive, non-linear, association between weekly rainfall and suspected cholera incidence in the following 10 days; the relative risk of cholera after a weekly rainfall of 25 mm was 1.42 (95% CI 1.31-1.55) compared with a week without rain. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis suggests that the small first cholera epidemic wave seeded cholera across Yemen during the dry season. When the rains returned in April, 2017, they triggered widespread cholera transmission that led to the large second wave. These results suggest that cholera could resurge during the ongoing 2018 rainy season if transmission remains active. Therefore, health authorities and partners should immediately enhance current control efforts to mitigate the risk of a new cholera epidemic wave in Yemen.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium species are enteric protozoa that cause significant morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. We characterized the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium in children from 8 resource-limited sites in Africa, Asia, and South America. METHODS: Children were enrolled within 17 days of birth and followed twice weekly for 24 months. Diarrheal and monthly surveillance stool samples were tested for Cryptosporidium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Socioeconomic data were collected by survey, and anthropometry was measured monthly. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent (962/1486) of children had a Cryptosporidium infection and 54% (802/1486) had at least 1 Cryptosporidium-associated diarrheal episode. Cryptosporidium diarrhea was more likely to be associated with dehydration (16.5% vs 8.3%, P < .01). Rates of Cryptosporidium diarrhea were highest in the Peru (10.9%) and Pakistan (9.2%) sites. In multivariable regression analysis, overcrowding at home was a significant risk factor for infection in the Bangladesh site (odds ratio, 2.3 [95% confidence interval CI, 1.2-4.6]). Multiple linear regression demonstrated a decreased length-for-age z score at 24 months in Cryptosporidium-positive children in the India (beta = -.26 [95% CI, -.51 to -.01]) and Bangladesh (beta = -.20 [95% CI, -.44 to .05]) sites. CONCLUSIONS: This multicountry cohort study confirmed the association of Cryptosporidium infection with stunting in 2 South Asian sites, highlighting the significance of cryptosporidiosis as a risk factor for poor growth. We observed that the rate, age of onset, and number of repeat infections varied per site; future interventions should be targeted per region to maximize success.",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends the surveillance of rotavirus strains prior to vaccine introduction in all applicable countries. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics as well as to determine the circulating genotypes of rotaviruses in Cote d'Ivoire prior to vaccine introduction. METHODS: The study included children under five years of age who met the inclusion criteria after informed consent had been sort from their parents or guardians. Rotavirus VP6 antigens were detected for each stool sample using Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA). Genotyping of positive EIA samples was performed by reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assays. RESULTS: A total of 684 children were recruited. Children aged between 6 and 11 months were the most represented with 34%. Rotavirus VP6 antigens were found in 27.1% (186/684) of samples tested. Commonly detected G genotypes included G12 (46.6% (82/176) and G1 (13.1% (23/176) whilst P[8] (49.8% (91/183) was the most predominant P genotype. Rotavirus G12P[8] was the most predominant strain circulating in Cote d'Ivoire within the period of study and constituted 26.6% of all strains detected. CONCLUSION: The monitoring of circulating strains will help guide decision-makers in the choice of vaccine. Genotypic variability of circulating rotavirus strains over the years implies there is a need for continuous rotavirus strain surveillance even after vaccine introduction.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have low gut microbial diversity and few anaerobes. It is unclear whether the low diversity pertains to prematurity itself or is due to differences in delivery mode, feeding mode or exposure to antibiotics. METHODS: The Norwegian Microbiota Study (NoMIC) was established to examine the colonization of the infant gut and health outcomes. 16S rRNA gene Illumina amplicon-sequenced samples from 519 children (160 preterms), collected at 10 days, 4 months and 1 year postnatally, were used to calculate alpha diversity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were analysed with gas chromatography and quantified using flame ionization detection. We regressed alpha diversity on gestational age, taking into account possible confounding and mediating factors, such as breastfeeding and antibiotics. Taxonomic differences were tested using Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes (ANCOM) and SCFA profile (as a functional indicator of the microbiota) was tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum. RESULTS: Preterm infants had 0.45 Shannon units lower bacterial diversity at 10 days postnatally compared with infants born at term (95% confidence interval: -0.60, -0.32). Breastfeeding status and antibiotic exposure were not significant mediators of the gestational age-diversity association, although time spent in the neonatal intensive care unit was. Vaginally born, exclusively breastfed preterm infantss not exposed to antibiotics at 10 days postnatally had fewer Firmicutes and more Proteobacteria than children born at term and an SCFA profile indicating lower saccharolytic fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants had distinct gut microbiome composition and function in the early postnatal period, not explained by factors more common in preterms, such as shorter breastfeeding duration, more antibiotics or caesarean delivery.",

			"abstract": "The evolutional trajectory of gut microbial colonization from birth has been shown to prime for health later in life. Here, we combined cultivation-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics to investigate the functional maturation of gut microbiota in faecal samples from full-term healthy infants collected at 6 and 18 months of age. Phylogenetic analysis of the metaproteomes showed that Bifidobacterium provided the highest number of distinct protein groups. Considerable divergences between taxa abundance and protein phylogeny were observed at all taxonomic ranks. Age had a profound effect on early microbiota where compositional and functional diversity of less dissimilar communities increased with time. Comparisons of the relative abundances of proteins revealed the transition of taxon-associated saccharolytic and fermentation strategies from milk and mucin-derived monosaccharide catabolism feeding acetate/propanoate synthesis to complex food-derived hexoses fuelling butanoate production. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis uncovered two anti-correlated modules of functional taxa. A low-connected Bifidobacteriaceae-centred guild of facultative anaerobes was succeeded by a rich club of obligate anaerobes densely interconnected around Lachnospiraceae, underpinning their pivotal roles in microbial ecosystem assemblies. Our findings establish a framework to visualize whole microbial community metabolism and ecosystem succession dynamics, proposing opportunities for microbiota-targeted health-promoting strategies early in life.",

			"abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy involving genetic and environmental factors, whose interaction influences disease risk. The intestinal microbiota, including viruses and bacteria, could play a role in the pathological process leading to gluten intolerance. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of pathogens in the intestinal microbiota of infants at familial risk of developing CD. We included 127 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative with CD. Infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breastfeeding or formula feeding) and HLA-DQ genotype (low, intermediate or high genetic risk). The prevalence of pathogenic bacteria and viruses was assessed in the faeces of the infants at 7 days, 1 month and 4 months of age. The prevalence of Clostridium perfringens was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed over the study period, and that of C. difficile at 4 months. Among breastfed infants, a higher prevalence of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) was found in infants with the highest genetic risk compared either to those with a low or intermediate risk. Among formula-fed infants, a higher prevalence of ETEC was also found in infants with a high genetic risk compared to those of intermediate risk. Our results show that specific factors, such as formula feeding and the HLA-DQ2 genotype, previously linked to a higher risk of developing CD, influence the presence of pathogenic bacteria differently in the intestinal microbiota in early life. Further studies are warranted to establish whether these associations are related to CD onset later in life.",

			"abstract": "During the first weeks of life, microbial colonization of the gut impacts human immune system maturation and other developmental processes. In premature infants, aberrant colonization has been implicated in the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening intestinal disease. To study the premature infant gut colonization process, genome-resolved metagenomics was conducted on 343 fecal samples collected during the first 3 months of life from 35 premature infants housed in a neonatal intensive care unit, 14 of whom developed NEC, and metaproteomic measurements were made on 87 samples. Microbial community composition and proteomic profiles remained relatively stable on the time scale of a week, but the proteome was more variable. Although genetically similar organisms colonized many infants, most infants were colonized by distinct strains with metabolic profiles that could be distinguished using metaproteomics. Microbiome composition correlated with infant, antibiotics administration, and NEC diagnosis. Communities were found to cluster into seven primary types, and community type switched within infants, sometimes multiple times. Interestingly, some communities sampled from the same infant at subsequent time points clustered with those of other infants. In some cases, switches preceded onset of NEC; however, no species or community type could account for NEC across the majority of infants. In addition to a correlation of protein abundances with organism replication rates, we found that organism proteomes correlated with overall community composition. Thus, this genome-resolved proteomics study demonstrated that the contributions of individual organisms to microbiome development depend on microbial community context.IMPORTANCE Humans are colonized by microbes at birth, a process that is important to health and development. However, much remains to be known about the fine-scale microbial dynamics that occur during the colonization period. We conducted a genome-resolved study of microbial community composition, replication rates, and proteomes during the first 3 months of life of both healthy and sick premature infants. Infants were found to be colonized by similar microbes, but each underwent a distinct colonization trajectory. Interestingly, related microbes colonizing different infants were found to have distinct proteomes, indicating that microbiome function is not only driven by which organisms are present, but also largely depends on microbial responses to the unique set of physiological conditions in the infant gut.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the last two decades, the consumption of drugs of abuse among women of childbearing age has experienced a significant increase and results from analyses of surveys concerning maternal intake of psychoactive prescription drugs during pregnancy indicate that the rates of intake are increasing each year. Analyses of biological matrices such as maternal hair and neonatal meconium have recently been used for assessment of gestational consumption and consequent prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse in high-risk groups of women. METHODS: Maternal hair and neonatal meconium were analyzed by validated chromatographic-mass spectrometric methodologies to disclose the gestational use of drugs of abuse and psychoactive prescription drugs and consequent prenatal exposure in a cohort of 513 mother-newborn dyads at the Sant Joan de Deu Barcelona Hospital, Spain, during 2012-2013. RESULTS: A total of 3.9% women reported drugs of abuse or prescription psychoactive drug consumption at any time during pregnancy. The prevalence of gestational consumption and the consequent prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse (e.g. cannabis, cocaine and MDMA) was 1.2% in maternal hair and 0.4% in meconium; and of psychoactive prescription drugs (e.g. venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, clomipramine), was 1.7% in maternal hair and 1.2% in meconium. The prevalence of drugs of abuse and prescription psychoactive drug consumption was lower in our specific cohort of Spanish pregnant women than in other cohorts such as those from U.S. or Denmark. CONCLUSION: Analysis of materno-fetal matrices provides a viable alternative to study prenatal exposure to these substances and develop specific social and health intervention recommendations.",

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of GII noroviruses in hospitalized children less than 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). A total of 210 stool specimens were collected from Ali Asghar Children's Hospital and Bahrami Children's Hospital in Tehran, from June 2015 to June 2016. The samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR for genogroup II (GII). Positive samples were genotyped by semi-nested PCR followed by Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Norovirus was identified in 36 (17.1%) of 210 specimens. Based on genetic analysis of RdRp and capsid sequences, the strains were clustered into eight RdRp-capsid genotypes: GII.P4-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (41.7%), GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (30.6%), GII.P21-GII.3 (13.9%), GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (2.8%), GII.P16-GII.12 (2.8%), GII.P2-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (2.8%), GII.P7-GII.7 (2.8%) and GII.P2-GII.2 (2.8%). We determined several different co-circulating norovirus genotypes in children < 5 years of age with AGE in our hospital in Tehran, Iran. Continued molecular surveillance of noroviruses, including typing of both RdRp and capsid genes, is important for monitoring emerging strains in our continued efforts to reduce the overall burden of norovirus disease.",

The microbiome has increasingly been recognized as a modifiable environmental factor to influence host development. Here we explore the hypothesis that the microbiome influences both growth phenotype and brain development. A germ free mouse transfaunation model was used to examine the effects of preterm infant microbiotas known to induce either high growth or low growth phenotypes on postnatal brain development. The microbiome which induced the low growth phenotype was associated with decreases in the neuronal markers NeuN and neurofilament-L as well as the myelination marker MBP when compared to the microbiome associated with the high growth phenotype. Additionally, poor growth phenotype-associated microbiota was associated with increased neuroinflammation marked by increased Nos1, as well as alteration in IGF-1 pathway including decreased circulating and brain IGF-1, decreased circulating IGFBP3, and increased Igfbp3 brain mRNA expression. This study suggests that growth-associated microbiota can influence early neuron and oligodendrocyte development and that this effect may be mediated by effects on neuroinflammation and circulating IGF-1.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether a dietary supplement of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) reduces Candida colonization in preterm infants. METHODS: Preterm infants with Candida colonization (n = 12) receiving enteral feedings of either infant formula (n = 5) or breast milk (n = 7) were randomized to MCT supplementation (n = 8) or no supplementation (n = 4). Daily stool samples were collected to determine fungal burden during a 3-week study period. Infants in the MCT group received supplementation during 1 week of the study period. The primary outcome was fungal burden during the supplementation period as compared with the periods before and after supplementation. RESULTS: Supplementation of MCT led to a marked increase in MCT intake relative to unsupplemented breast milk or formula as measured by capric acid content. In the treatment group, there was a significant reduction in fungal burden during the supplementation period as compared with the period before supplementation (rate ratio, 0.15; P = 0.02), with a significant increase after supplementation was stopped (rate ratio, 61; P < 0.001). Fungal burden in the control group did not show similar changes. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation with MCT may be an effective method to reduce Candida colonization in preterm infants.",

			"article_name": "Asymptomatic norovirus infection associated with swimming at a tropical beach: A prospective cohort study.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Swimming in fecally-contaminated waterbodies can result in gastrointestinal infections. However, the pathogenic microorganisms responsible are not well understood because sporadic cases of illness are not reported completely, exposure information is often not collected, and epidemiology studies rely on self-reported symptoms. Noroviruses are considered a likely cause because they are found in high densities in sewage, resistant to wastewater treatment and survive in the environment. In this study, saliva samples were collected from subjects at a beach in Puerto Rico and tested for evidence of norovirus-specific IgG responses as an indicator of incident norovirus infection. METHODS: Saliva samples were collected from 1298 participants using an oral swab. Samples were collected on the day of the beach visit (S1); after 10-12 days (S2); and after three weeks (S3). Saliva was tested for IgG responses to GI.1 and GII.4 noroviruses using a microsphere based multiplex salivary immunoassay. Immunoconversion was defined as a four-fold increase in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from S1 to S2 with the S3 sample at least three times above the S1 MFI. RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects (2.6%) immunoconverted to GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus. Swimmers who immersed their head in water had a higher rate of immunoconversion (3.4%), compared to either non-swimmers (0.0%, p = 0.003) or waders and non-swimmers combined (0.4%, Odds Ratio: 5.07, 95% Confidence Interval:1.48-17.00). Immunoconversion was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate an association between swimming at a beach impacted by fecal contamination and asymptomatic norovirus infection.

Quantifying childhood hospitalizations caused by severe rotavirus infections is also important in demonstrating disease burden caused by this virus. The objective of this study is to update and confirm the current burden of pediatric hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus gastroenteritis among Cambodian children using seven years of continuous active, prospective surveillance from 2010 to 2016. We also characterize the circulating rotavirus genotypic strains during this period. METHODS: Active surveillance for rotavirus gastroenteritis was conducted from January 2010 through December 2016 at a national hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Children <60\u202fmonths of age who were hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were consented and enrolled. Information on gender, age, clinical characteristics, and month of onset were collected. Stool specimens were collected and tested by enzyme immunoassay for the presence of rotavirus antigen, and genotyping was performed on rotavirus test-positive specimens to characterize predominant rotavirus strains during the surveillance period. RESULTS: Of 7007 children enrolled with AGE and having specimens collected, 3473 (50%) were attributed to rotavirus gastroenteritis. The majority of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children younger than two years old (92%). Year-round rotavirus transmission was observed, with seasonal peaks during the cooler, dry months between November and May. Genotypic trends in rotavirus were observed over the surveillance period; the predominant rotavirus strains changed from G1P[8] (2010-2012), to G2P[4] (2013-2014), the emergence of genotype G8P[8] in 2015, and G3P[8] in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in Cambodian children under five years old, with 50% of such hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus. Over 90% of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children under 2\u202fyears of age. Changes in the predominant rotavirus strains occurred over time among these unvaccinated children. This information is important to understand and prioritize the current potential impacts upon child health that could be achieved through the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in Cambodia.",

The second objective of this research was to determine risk factors associated with S. aureus intestinal colonization. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 781 specimens from inpatients and outpatients at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics Clinical Microbiology Laboratory was conducted. S. aureus was identified using traditional culture methodologies. Methicillin-resistance was determined via PCR of the mecA gene. PVL PCR, spa typing, and antimicrobial sensitivity testing were also done. A nested case-control study was done on a subset of patients with all colonized patients defined as cases and non-colonized controls. Medical record abstractions were done to identify risk factors for intestinal colonization in the nested study. RESULTS: Out of 625 patients included in the final study, 58 were positive for S. aureus (9.3%). One isolate was positive for the PVL gene. A high number of isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics including oxacillin (43.1%), erythromycin (51.7%), and levofloxacin (41.4%). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin.

The aim of this study was to investigate the presentation and complications of rotavirus compared to non-rotavirus gastroenteritis in UK children. METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-control, hospital-based study conducted at three sites in east London, UK. Cases were children aged 1 month to 16 years diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2013, in whom stool virology investigations confirmed presence of rotavirus by PCR. They were matched by age, gender and month of presentation to controls with rotavirus-negative gastroenteritis. RESULTS: Data were collected from 116 children (50 cases and 66 controls). Children with rotavirus gastroenteritis tended to present more frequently with metabolic acidosis (pH 7.30 vs 7.37, P = 0.011) and fever (74% versus 46%; P = 0.005) and were more likely to require hospitalisation compared to children with non-rotavirus gastroenteritis (93% versus 73%; P = 0.019). Neurological complications were the most common extra-intestinal manifestations, but did not differ significantly between children with rotavirus-positive gastroenteritis (RPG) and rotavirus-negative gastroenteritis (RNG) (24% versus 15%, respectively; P = 0.24). Encephalopathy occurred only in children with rotavirus infection (n = 3, 6%). CONCLUSION: Rotavirus causes longer and more severe disease compared to other viral pathogens. Seizures and milder neurological signs were surprisingly common and associated with multiple pathogens, but encephalopathy occurred only in children with rotavirus gastroenteritis. Rotavirus vaccination may reduce seizures and presentation to hospital, but vaccines against other pathogens causing gastroenteritis are required.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: To explore the influences of prenatal antibiotic exposure, the intensity of prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure on gut microbiota of preterm infants and whether gut microbiota and drug resistant strains in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over a defined period are related. METHODS: Among 28 preterm infants, there were two groups, the PAT (prenatal antibiotic therapy) group (12 cases), and the PAF (prenatal antibiotic free) group (12 cases). Fecal samples from both groups were collected on days 7 and 14. According to the time of prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure, cases were divided into two groups, H (high) group (11 cases) and L (low) group (11 cases), and fecal samples on day 14 were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and was subjected to high throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the sequencing results. RESULTS: Prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure exercised influence on the early establishment of intestinal microflora of preterm infants. Bacteroidetes decreased significantly in the PAT group (p < 0.05). The number of Bifidobacterium significantly decreased in the PAT group and H group (p < 0.05). The early gut microbiota of preterm infants with prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure was similar to resistant bacteria in NICU during the same period. CONCLUSION: Prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure may affect the composition of early gut microbiota in preterm infants. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in NICU may play a role in reshaping the early gut microbiota of preterm infants with prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure.",

We aimed to determine whether an infant formula supplemented with probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CECT7210 (B. infantis IM1) is effective at reducing diarrhea incidence in healthy term infants.MethodsDouble-blinded, randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trial, where formula-fed infants (<3 months) received an infant formula supplemented (Probiotic) or not (Control) with 10(7) cfu/g of B. infantis IM1 over 12 weeks. Diarrheas, growth, digestive symptoms, stool bifidobacteria, and microbiota were assessed.ResultsIn all, 97 (Control) and 93 (Probiotic) infants were randomized, and 78 (Control) and 73 (Probiotic) completed the 12 week-follow-up. In the overall study period, a median of 0.29+/-1.07 and 0.05+/-0.28 diarrhea events/infant was observed in the Control and Probiotic groups, respectively (P=0.059). This trend to less diarrhea episodes in the Probiotic group reached statistical significance at 8 weeks (0.12+/-0.47 vs. 0.0+/-0.0 events/infant, P=0.047). Constipation incidence was higher (odds ratio (OR) 2.67 (1.09-6.50)) and stool frequency lower (2.0+/-1.0 vs. 2.6+/-1.3 stools/day, P=0.038) in the Control group after 4 weeks.

To test our hypothesis, we investigated whether maternal factors during pregnancy, such as biodiversity of the living environment, influence the microbiome of the first stool more than immediate perinatal factors. METHODS: We recruited 218 consecutive newborn infants from one hospital. Regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to characterize the microbiomes of the first-pass meconium samples (N=212). We used a multivariate model to determine both the prenatal and perinatal factors affecting the microbiome. RESULTS: The number of operational taxonomic units ranged from 0 to 448 per newborn. The most abundant phyla were Firmicutes, with a relative abundance of 44%, Proteobacteria, 28%, and Bacteroidetes, 15%. By a multivariate analysis, the biodiversity of the home environment increased the diversity of microbiomes, whereas perinatal factors, such as the delivery mode or exposure to antimicrobials during labor did not have an effect. CONCLUSION: The microbiome of the first-pass meconium was not altered by immediate perinatal factors, but was affected by maternal factors during pregnancy, implying the in utero transfer of microbes and the development of the gut microbiota niche in fetal life.",

			"abstract": "Intrauterine environmental factors can be associated with perinatal complications and long-term health outcomes although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Meconium formed exclusively in utero and passed naturally by a neonate may contain proteins which characterise the intrauterine environment. The aim of the study was proteomic analysis of the composition of meconium proteins and their classification by biological function. Proteomic techniques combining isoelectrofocussing fractionation and LC-MS/MS analysis were used to study the protein composition of a meconium sample obtained by pooling 50 serial meconium portions from 10 healthy full-term neonates. The proteins were classified by function based on the literature search for each protein in the PubMed database. A total of 946 proteins were identified in the meconium, including 430 proteins represented by two or more peptides. When the proteins were classified by their biological function the following were identified: immunoglobulin fragments and enzymatic, neutrophil-derived, structural and fetal intestine-specific proteins. Meconium is a rich source of proteins deposited in the fetal intestine during its development in utero. A better understanding of their specific biological functions in the intrauterine environment may help to identify these proteins which may serve as biomarkers associated with specific clinical conditions/diseases with the possible impact on the fetal development and further health consequences in infants, older children and adults.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ontario introduced a universal publicly-funded group A rotavirus (RVA) immunization program in August 2011, using monovalent vaccine. RVA immunization programs have decreased the incidence of RVA acute gastroenteritis in many countries but it is unclear if it will contribute to the emergence of certain genotypes. We monitored RVA trends and genotypes in Ontario before and after implementation of the publicly-funded immunization program. METHODS: RVA detection was conducted at Public Health Ontario Laboratories from January 2009 to December 2011 (pre-program period) and January 2012 to October 2015 (publicly-funded RVA immunization program period) and number of RVA-positive specimens and percent positivity were analysed. A convenience sample of RVA-positive stool specimens, from September 2010 to December 2011 (pre-program period) and January 2012 to June 2013 (program period), were genotyped using heminested PCR. A literature review on the burden of illness from emergent genotype was performed. RESULTS: Stool specimens showed a significant decrease in RVA percent positivity from the 36\u202fmonth pre-program period (14.4%; 1537/10700) to the 46\u202fmonth program period (6.1%; 548/9019). An increase in the proportion of RVA G10 among genotyped specimens, associated with five different P genotypes, from the pre-program (6.3%; 13/205) to the program (31.5%; 40/127) period was observed. Our literature review identified approximately 200 G10-positive human stool specimens from 16 different countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study documented a decrease in the number of RVA-positive specimens and percent positivity after implementation of the immunization program. An unexpected increase in the proportion of RVA G10 was detected following program introduction. Ongoing RVA surveillance is important in evaluating both the long-term impact of immunization and emergence of RVA genotypes.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish baseline trends in fecal calprotectin, a protein excreted into the stool when there is neutrophilic inflammation in the bowel, in infants at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in infants with a birth weight of <1500 g without existing bowel disease at a level IV neonatal intensive care unit from October 2015 to September 2016. Stools were collected once daily for 30 days or until 32 weeks postmenstrual age and processed using the Fecal Calprotectin High Range Quantitative Quantum Blue assay. RESULTS: In 64 preterm infants, during the first week after birth, 62% of infants had an initial stool sample with high baseline calprotectin levels (>/=200 microg/g). In assessment of maternal and neonatal risk factors, maternal etiology for preterm birth (ie, eclamplsia or preeclampsia) was the only significant factor associated with high baseline calprotectin level. Two patients in the cohort developed NEC. Calprotectin levels for the entire cohort fluctuated during the observed period but generally increased in the third and fourth weeks after birth. CONCLUSIONS: At-risk infants had highly variable fecal calprotectin levels, with maternal causes for preterm birth associated with higher baseline levels. More longitudinal data in infants with NEC are necessary to determine whether acute rises in fecal calprotectin levels prior to clinical diagnosis can be confirmed as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker.",

This is a prospective observational study and was conducted between 1 January 2015 and 30 June 2017. We included consequent patients who had acute diarrhea. At the end of 2015, we implemented ASP in acute diarrhea cases and compared the outcomes in the pre-ASP and post-ASP periods. An FDA-cleared multiplexed gastrointestinal PCR panel system, the BioFire FilmArray (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT), which detects 20 pathogens in stool, was used. In 499 out of 699 patients (71%), at least one pathogen was detected. Among 314 adults with positive MGPT, 101 (32%) enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), 71 (23%) enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), 68 (22%) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 55 (18%) Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (17%) Norovirus, 48 (15%) Campylobacter, 21 (7%) Salmonella, and 20 (6%) Clostridium difficile strains were detected.

Inappropriate antibiotic use decreased in the post-ASP period compared with the pre-ASP period among inpatients (42.9% and 25.8%, respectively; P = 0.023). Using MGPT in clinical practice significantly decreased the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Detection of high rates of C. difficile in children and Salmonella spp., as well as relatively high rates of Campylobacter spp., which were hard to isolate by routine stool culture, were remarkable.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is estimated to cause approximately five thousand deaths annually among Afghan children under 5\u202fyears old. Because laboratory confirmation of rotavirus is not routinely performed in clinical settings, assessing the precise burden of disease attributable to severe rotavirus gastroenteritis typically requires active surveillance efforts. This study describes the current burden of pediatric hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus gastroenteritis among Afghan children using surveillance data collected from 2013 to 2015. METHODS: Rotavirus surveillance was conducted from January 2013 through December 2015 at two of the largest hospitals in the country, Indira Gandhi Children Hospital in Kabul and Herat Regional Hospital. Children between 1 and 60\u202fmonths of age who were admitted to these hospitals for diarrhea were consented and enrolled. Information on age, gender, and seasonality were collected. Stool specimens were collected and tested by enzyme immunoassay for the presence of rotavirus at the central public health laboratory in Afghanistan. RESULTS: Overall, 1,413 of 2,737 (52%) of hospitalized children under five years old with diarrhea were rotavirus cases. The overwhelming majority of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children younger than two years of age (93%) while 42% of all rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children between 6 and 11\u202fmonths of age. Rotavirus transmission occurred year-round. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus is a major cause of severe acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in young Afghan children, responsible for over half of diarrheal hospitalizations in this population. The Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health has prioritized reducing child mortality by 2020 and is actively working towards the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Afghan children. These data will be instrumental in understanding the potential impact upon child health that may be achieved through the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in Afghanistan.",

			"abstract": "Vertical transmission of bacteria from mother to infant at birth is postulated to initiate a life-long host-microbe symbiosis, playing an important role in early infant development. However, only the tracking of strictly defined unique microbial strains can clarify where the intestinal bacteria come from, how long the initial colonizers persist, and whether colonization by other strains from the environment can replace existing ones. Using rare single nucleotide variants in fecal metagenomes of infants and their family members, we show strong evidence of selective and persistent transmission of maternal strain populations to the vaginally born infant and their occasional replacement by strains from the environment, including those from family members, in later childhood. Only strains from the classes Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia, which are essential components of the infant microbiome, are transmitted from the mother and persist for at least 1 yr. In contrast, maternal strains of Clostridia, a dominant class in the mother's gut microbiome, are not observed in the infant. Caesarean-born infants show a striking lack of maternal transmission at birth. After the first year, strain influx from the family environment occurs and continues even in adulthood. Fathers appear to be more frequently donors of novel strains to other family members than receivers. Thus, the infant gut is seeded by selected maternal bacteria, which expand to form a stable community, with a rare but stable continuing strain influx over time.",

			"abstract": "Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of both necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) in preterm infants are yet to be elucidated, evidence is emerging that the gut microbiota plays a key role in their pathophysiology. Areas covered: In this review, initial microbial colonization and factors influencing microbiota composition are discussed. For both NEC and LOS, an overview of studies investigating preclinical alterations in gut microbiota composition and fecal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is provided. Fecal VOCs are considered to reflect not only gut microbiota composition, but also their metabolic activity and concurrent interaction with the host. Expert review: Heterogeneity in study protocols and applied analytical techniques hampers reliable comparison between outcomes of different microbiota studies, limiting the ability to draw firm conclusions. This dilemma is illustrated by the finding that study results often cannot be reproduced, or even contradict each other. A NEC- and sepsis specific microbial or metabolic signature has not yet been discovered. Identification of 'disease-specific' VOCs and microbiota composition may increase understanding on pathophysiological mechanisms and may allow for development of an accurate screening tool, opening avenues towards timely identification and initiation of targeted treatment for preterm infants at increased risk for NEC and sepsis.",

We evaluated existing outbreak response strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for control of cVDPV2 outbreaks. METHODS: Seronegative children for poliovirus type 2 (PV2) at 22\u202fweeks of life were assigned to one of four study groups and received respectively (1) one dose of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV); (2) monovalent OPV 2 (mOPV2); (3) tOPV together with a dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV); or (4) mOPV2 with monovalent high-potency IPV type 2. Stool and blood samples were collected and assessed for presence of PV2 (stool) and anti-polio antibodies (sera). RESULTS: We analyzed data from 265 children seronegative for PV2. Seroconversion to PV2 was achieved in 48, 76, 98 and 100% in Groups 1-4 respectively. mOPV2 was more immunogenic than tOPV alone (p\u202f<\u202f0.001); and OPV in combination with IPV was more immunogenic than OPV alone (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). There were 33%, 67%, 20% and 43% PV2 excretors in Groups 1-4 respectively. mOPV2 resulted in more prevalent shedding of PV2 than when tOPV was used (p\u202f<\u202f0.001); and tOPV together with IPV resulted in lower excretion of PV2 than tOPV alone (p\u202f=\u202f0.046). CONCLUSION: mOPV2 was a more potent vaccine than tOPV. Adding IPV to OPV improved immunological response; adding IPV also seemed to have shortened the duration of PV2 shedding. mIPV2 did not provide measurable improvement of immune response when compared to conventional IPV. WHO recommendation to use mOPV2 as a vaccine of first choice in cVDPV2 outbreak response was supported by our findings. Clinical Trial registry number: NCT02189811.",

In this study, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and two different bioinformatic approaches, based on mapping of the reads onto databases and on the reconstruction of putative draft genomes, to investigate possible changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in samples from patients with Shiga Toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection compared to healthy and healed controls, collected during an outbreak caused by a STEC O26:H11 infection. Both the bioinformatic procedures used, produced similar result with a good resolution of the taxonomic profiles of the specimens. The stool samples collected from the STEC infected patients showed a lower abundance of the members of Bifidobacteriales and Clostridiales orders in comparison to controls where those microorganisms predominated. These differences seemed to correlate with the STEC infection although a flexion in the relative abundance of the Bifidobacterium genus, part of the Bifidobacteriales order, was observed also in samples from Crohn's disease patients, displaying a STEC-unrelated dysbiosis. The metagenomics also allowed to identify in the STEC positive samples, all the virulence traits present in the genomes of the STEC O26 that caused the outbreak as assessed through isolation of the epidemic strain and whole genome sequencing. The results shown represent a first evidence of the changes occurring in the intestinal microbiota of children in the course of STEC infection and indicate that metagenomics may be a promising tool for the culture-independent clinical diagnosis of the infection.",

Here, we used a metagenomic sequencing technique to characterize the meconium microbiome from the feces of a Chinese cohort of vaginally and C-section-delivered infants, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) newborns, during the first 24 h after birth. Meconium microbiome diversity was higher in vaginally delivered infants than that in C-section-delivered infants. Propionibacterium species were most abundant in the vaginally delivered infants, whereas the C-section group had high levels of Bacillus licheniformis. The two IVF newborns delivered by C-section harbored microbial communities similar to the vaginal microbiome in terms of taxonomic composition. Metabolic functions of the C-section group suffered more from the influence of the dominant group (B. licheniformis), whereas the vaginal group was more homogeneous, with a metabolism dominated by multi-microbes. Moreover, different modes of delivery affected the antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) prevalence. These findings provide novel information for the development of strategies to guide a healthy mode of delivery and promote the formation of healthy microbiota.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The emergence of resistance amongst commensal flora is a serious threat to the community. However, there is paucity of data regarding antibiotic resistance in commensals in the absence of antibiotic pressure. METHODS: Altogether, 100 vaginally delivered antibiotic naive exclusively breastfed neonates were selected. Stool samples collected on day (D)1, D21 and D60 of birth were cultured. Enterobacteriaceae isolates were screened for nalidixic acid (NA) and ciprofloxacin susceptibility as per CLSI guidelines. In 28 randomly selected neonates, isolates (n=92) resistant to NA and ciprofloxacin were characterized for the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (qnrA, qnrB and qnrS, qepAand aac(6')-Ib-cr) and mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA and parC genes by specific primers and confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 343 Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 100 neonates. On D1, 58 % of neonates were colonized with at least one Enterobacteriaceae predominantly E. coli. Overall resistance to NA was 60 % but ciprofloxacin resistance increased significantly from 15 % (14/96) on D1 to 38 % (50/132) on D60 (P-value <0.001). The predominant mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance was mutation in gyrA (n=49) with or without PMQR. PMQR carrying isolates increased more than fivefold from D1 to D60. CONCLUSION: A high level of fluoroquinolone resistance in gut flora of antibiotic naive and exclusively breastfed neonates suggests a rampant rise of resistance in the community. The source of resistance genes on D1 is probably maternal flora acquired at birth. High load of PMQR genes in commensal flora are a potential source of spread to pathogenic organisms.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate whether alterations in the developing intestinal microbiota and immune markers precede celiac disease (CD) onset in infants at familial risk of developing the disease. METHODS: A nested case-control study was carried out as part of a larger prospective cohort study, which included healthy full-term newborns (> 200) with at least one first relative with biopsy-verified CD. The present study includes cases of CD (n = 10) and the best-matched controls (n = 10) who did not develop the disease after 5-year follow-up. Fecal microbiota, assessed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and immune parameters were profiled at 4 and 6 months of age and related to CD onset. RESULTS: The microbiota of infants who remained healthy showed an increase in bacterial diversity over time, characterized by increases in Firmicutes families, but not those who developed CD. Infants who subsequently developed CD showed a significant reduction in sIgA levels over time, while those who remained healthy showed increases in TNF-alpha correlated to Bifidobacterium spp. An increased relative abundance of Bifidobacterium longum was associated with control children while increased proportions of Bifidobacterium breve and Enterococcus spp. were associated with CD development. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that alterations in the early trajectory of gut microbiota in infants at CD risk could influence the immune maturation process and predispose to CD, although larger population studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis.",

			"abstract": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic dysfunction in infancy precedes childhood atopy and asthma development. Here we examined gut microbiota maturation over the first year of life in infants at high risk for asthma (HR), and whether it is modifiable by early-life Lactobacillus supplementation. We performed a longitudinal comparison of stool samples collected from HR infants randomized to daily oral Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (HRLGG) or placebo (HRP) for 6 months, and healthy (HC) infants. Meconium microbiota of HRP participants is distinct, follows a delayed developmental trajectory, and is primarily glycolytic and depleted of a range of anti-inflammatory lipids at 6 months of age. These deficits are partly rescued in HRLGG infants, but this effect was lost at 12 months of age, 6 months after cessation of supplementation. Thus we show that early-life gut microbial development is distinct, but plastic, in HR infants. Our findings offer a novel strategy for early-life preventative interventions.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a saline enema during the first stage of labour in reducing neonatal colonization with C. difficile. METHODS: This study was conducted at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt from January 2016 to July 2016. Asymptomatic mothers with uncomplicated vaginal delivery and their neonates without diarrhoea were included. The study group underwent saline enema, and the control group had no intervention. Stool samples were collected from neonates one week after delivery. The primary outcome was the detection of C. difficile in stool culture and direct detection of C. difficile Toxin A and Toxin B by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FINDINGS: The two groups were comparable (P>0.05) in terms of age, gravidity, parity, body mass index and gestational age. C. difficile was detected in 13.54% and 37.63% of stool cultures from the enema group and the control group, respectively (P<0.001). Direct detection of Toxins A and B was positive in 22.92% of cases in the enema group and 53.76% of cases in the control group (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a saline enema for the mother during the first stage of labour may be useful in reducing the risk of neonatal gut colonization by C. difficile.",

Eight isolates (L. reuteri 3M02 and 3M03, L. gasseri 4M13, 4R22, 5R01, 5R02, and 5R13, and L. rhamnosus 4B15) with high tolerance to acid and bile salts, and ability to adhere to the intestine were screened from 22 strains. Further, functional properties of 8 Lactobacillus strains, such as anti-oxidation, inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity, cholesterol-lowering, and anti-inflammation were evaluated. The properties were strain-specific. Particularly, two strains of L. rhamnosus, 4B15 (4B15) and L. gasseri 4M13 (4M13) showed considerably higher anti-oxidation, inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity, and cholesterol-lowering, and greater inhibition of nitric oxide production than other strains. Moreover, the two selected strains substantially inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-10 stimulated the treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with LPS. In addition, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of 4B15 and 4M13 indicated them as novel genomic strains. These results suggested that 4B15 and 4M13 showed the highest probiotic potential and have an impact on immune health by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in exclusively breastfed infants with colic, randomly assigned to receive a probiotic-mixture or a placebo for 21 days. A structured diary of gastrointestinal events of the infants was given to the parents to complete. Samples of feces were also collected to evaluate microbial content and metabolome using fecal real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based analysis. Study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01869426). RESULTS: Fifty-three exclusively-breastfed infants completed three weeks of treatment with a probiotic-mixture (n = 27) or a placebo (n = 26). Infants receiving the probiotic-mixture had less minutes of crying per day throughout the study by the end of treatment period (68.4 min/day vs. 98.7 min/day; p = 0.001). A higher rate of infants from the probiotic-mixture group responded to treatment (defined by reduction of crying times of >/=50% from baseline), on day 14, 12 vs. 5 (p = 0.04) and on day 21, 26 vs. 17 (p = 0.001). A higher quality of life, assessed by a 10-cm visual analogue scale, was reported by parents of the probiotic-mixture group on day 14, 7.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 7.7 +/- 0.9 (p = 0.02); and on day 21, 6.7 +/- 1.6 vs. 5.9 +/- 1.0 (p = 0.001). No differences between groups were found regarding anthropometric data, bowel movements, stool consistency or microbiota composition. Probiotics were found to affect the fecal molecular profile. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of a probiotic-mixture appears safe and reduces inconsolable crying in exclusively breastfed infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of illness and death in young children in the world, especially the developing countries. Diarrheal disease results in about half a million childhood death per year, ranking second among all causes worldwide. Diarrheal disease due to rotavirus infection is currently the most common cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. Rotavirus immunization of infants is a safe and effective public health intervention for rotavirus infection control and expected to lead to a reduction of childhood morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We conducted hospital-based surveillance at two representative hospitals in Mongolia to estimate the burden of hospitalizations for rotavirus diarrhea among children aged\u202f<5\u202fyears and to describe strain distribution patterns during 6-year study period. Fecal specimens were tested by rotavirus antigen detection enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Specimens that tested positive for rotavirus were further characterized to determine the genotype of strains by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Between April 2009 and March 2016, among 7076 eligible children with diarrhea 6078 patients were enrolled nationally. Forty-six percent (2794/6078) of EIA a specimens were positive for rotavirus. Ninety-three percent (5649/6078) of hospitalizations for diarrhea involved children less than 2\u202fyears. No deaths were recorded due to rotavirus diarrhea. The most common genotype was G3P [8] (47.7%) followed by G9P [6] (14.4%), G2P [4] (12%), and G9P [8] (7.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a relatively high prevalence of severe rotavirus-associated diarrhea disease in Mongolia and infants were the most affected. It highlights the urgent need for introduction of rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization program. Continued surveillance is crucial and pre-vaccine introduction rotavirus genotype patterns in Mongolia are valuable and can be followed post-introduction to assess vaccine impact.",

			"article_name": "The other Campylobacters: Not innocent bystanders in endemic diarrhea and dysentery in children in low-income settings.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Campylobacter is one of the main causes of gastroenteritis worldwide. Most of the current knowledge about the epidemiology of this food-borne infection concerns two species, C. coli and C. jejuni. Recent studies conducted in developing countries and using novel diagnostic techniques have generated evidence of the increasing burden and importance of other Campylobacter species, i.e. non-C. coli/jejuni. We performed a nested case-control study to compare the prevalence of C. coli/jejuni and other Campylobacter in children with clinical dysentery and severe diarrhea as well as without diarrhea to better understand the clinical importance of infections with Campylobacter species other than C. coli/jejuni. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our nested case-control study of 439 stool samples included dysenteric stools, stools collected during severe diarrhea episodes, and asymptomatic stools which were systematically selected to be representative of clinical phenotypes from 9,160 stools collected during a birth cohort study of 201 children followed until two years of age. Other Campylobacter accounted for 76.4% of the 216 Campylobacter detections by qPCR and were more prevalent than C. coli/jejuni across all clinical groups. Other Campylobacter were also more prevalent than C. coli/jejuni across all age groups, with older children bearing a higher burden of other Campylobacter. Biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and injury (methylene blue, fecal occult test, myeloperoxidase or MPO) showed a strong association with dysentery, but mixed results with infection. MPO levels were generally higher among children infected with C. coli/jejuni, but Shigella-infected children suffering from dysentery recorded the highest levels (26,224 ng/mL); the lowest levels (10,625 ng/mL) were among asymptomatic children infected with other Campylobacter. Adjusting for age, sex, and Shigella infection, dysentery was significantly associated with C. coli/jejuni but not with other Campylobacter, whereas severe diarrhea was significantly associated with both C. coli/jejuni and other Campylobacter. Compared to asymptomatic children, children suffering from dysentery had a 14.6 odds of C. coli/jejuni infection (p-value < 0.001, 95% CI 5.5-38.7) but were equally likely to have other Campylobacter infections-odds ratio of 1.3 (0.434, 0.7-2.4). Children suffering from severe diarrhea were more likely than asymptomatic children to test positive for both C. coli/jejuni and other Campylobacter-OR of 2.8 (0.034, 1.1-7.1) and 1.9 (0.018, 1.1-3.1), respectively. Compared to the Campylobacter-free group, the odds of all diarrhea given C. coli/jejuni infection and other Campylobacter infection were 8.8 (<0.001, 3.0-25.7) and 2.4 (0.002, 1.4-4.2), respectively. Eliminating other Campylobacter in this population would eliminate 24.9% of the diarrhea cases, which is almost twice the population attributable fraction of 15.1% due to C. coli/jejuni. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Eighty-seven percent of the dysentery and 59.5% of the severe diarrhea samples were positive for Campylobacter, Shigella, or both, emphasizing the importance of targeting these pathogens to limit the impact of dysentery and severe diarrhea in children. Notably, the higher prevalence of other Campylobacter compared to C. coli/jejuni, their increasing burden during early childhood, and their association with severe diarrhea highlight the importance of these non-C. coli/jejuni Campylobacter species and suggest a need to clarify their importance in the etiology of clinical disease across different epidemiological contexts.",

We collected fecal samples from 45 breastfed preterm very low birth weight (birth weight < 1500 g) infants from birth until 60 days postnatal age to characterize the intestinal microbiota development during the first weeks of life in preterm infants. Fecal microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The main driver of microbiota development was gestational age; antibiotic use had strong but temporary effects and birth mode had little influence. Microbiota development proceeded in four phases indicated by the dominance of Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, and finally Bifidobacterium. The Enterococcus phase was only observed among the extremely premature infants and appeared to delay the microbiota succession. The results indicate that hospitalized preterm infants receiving breast milk may develop a normal microbiota resembling that of term infants.",

Whole genome phylogenetic analysis of the hedgehog isolates and ST183 from people in England and Wales found that PT11 and PT66 form two divergent clades. Hedgehog and human isolates were interspersed throughout the phylogeny indicating that infections in both species originate from a common population. PT11 was recovered from hedgehogs across England and Scotland, consistent with endemic infection. PT66 was isolated from Scotland only, possibly indicating a recent emergence event. People infected with ST183 were four times more likely to be aged 0-4 years than people infected by the more common ST11 S. Enteritidis. Evidence for human ST183 infection being non-foodborne included stronger correlation between geographic and genetic distance, and significantly increased likelihood of infection in rural areas, than for ST11. These results are consistent with hedgehogs acting as a source of zoonotic infection.",

METHODS: We sequenced 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes from 2304 stools from 121 children at St Louis Children's Hospital whose birthweight was </=1500 g, attempted to isolate C. sakazakii from 157 of these stools, genome-sequenced the recovered isolates, and sought correlations between indices of Cronobacter excretion, host characteristics, and unit formula use. RESULTS: Of these 2304 stools, 1271 (55.2%) contained Cronobacter rRNA gene sequences. The median (interquartile range) per-subject percentage of specimens with at least 1 Cronobacter sequence and the median per-subject read density were 57.1 (25.5-87.3) and 0.07 (0.01-0.67), respectively. There was no variation according to commercially prepared liquid vs powdered formula use in the neonatal intensive care unit, or the day of life that specimens were produced. However, the proportion of specimens containing >4.0% of reads mapping to Cronobacter fell from 4.3% to 0.9% after powdered infant formula was discontinued (P < .0001). We isolated sequence type 4 (ST4) C. sakazakii from multiple specimens from 2 subjects; 1 also harbored sequence type 233. The sequenced ST4 isolates from the 2 subjects had >99.9% sequence identity in the approximately 93% of best-match reference genome that they contained, and shared multiple virulence loci. CONCLUSIONS: Very low birthweight infants excrete putatively pathogenic Cronobacter. High-density Cronobacter sequence samples were more common during the use of powdered infant formula. Better understanding of the ecology of Cronobacter in infant guts will inform future prevention and control strategies.",

Although the effect of antibiotic treatment on microbiota development is well recognised, little attention has been paid to treatment duration. We studied the effect of short and long intravenous antibiotic administration on intestinal microbiota development in preterm infants. Faecal samples from 15 preterm infants (35 +/- 1 weeks gestation and 2871 +/- 260 g birth weight) exposed to no, short (</= 3 days) or long (>/= 5 days) treatment with amoxicillin/ceftazidime were collected during the first six postnatal weeks. Microbiota composition was determined through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Short and long antibiotic treat ment significantly lowered the abundance of Bifidobacterium right after treatment (p = 0.027) till postnatal week three (p = 0.028). Long treatment caused Bifidobacterium abundance to remain decreased till postnatal week six (p = 0.009). Antibiotic treatment was effective against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, but allowed Enterococcus to thrive and remain dominant for up to two weeks after antibiotic treatment discontinuation. Community richness and diversity were not affected by antibiotic treatment, but were positively associated with postnatal age (p < 0.023) and with abundance of Bifidobacterium (p = 0.003). Intravenous antibiotic administration during the first postnatal week greatly affects the infant's gastrointestinal microbiota. However, quick antibiotic treatment cessation allows for its recovery. Disturbances in microbiota development caused by short and, more extensively, by long antibiotic treatment could affect healthy development of the infant via interference with maturation of the immune system and gastrointestinal tract.",

The median age of rotavirus patients was 9\u202fmonths and 939/1207 (78%) rotavirus patients were aged 6-23\u202fmonths. Most (1097/1203; 91%) rotavirus patients were treated with intravenous fluids. G1P[8] was the predominant genotype during both years of surveillance, accounting for 133/222 (60%) of genotyped cases. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus is a major cause of hospitalization due to severe AGE in children <5\u202fyears of age in Tajikistan, accounting for >40% of cases. Continued, enhanced rotavirus surveillance may allow documentation of changes in rotavirus disease burden following vaccine introduction and assessment of vaccine effectiveness.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Although cholera remains to be an important public health problem, studies on reliable population-based estimates of laboratory confirmed cholera in endemic areas are limited worldwide. The aim of this hospital-based study was to evaluate the prevalence of Vibrio cholerae serogroup in Assam, India, during 2003-2013. METHODS: Stool samples/rectal swabs were collected from acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) cases during 2003-2013 and processed by standard microbiological procedures. Antibiotic sensitivity test was done following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Year-wise epidemiological trend of cholera was analyzed. RESULTS: Cholera contributed to 3.93 per cent of AWD cases. In Assam, cholera was found to be more prevalent in the rural areas (6.7%) followed by the tea gardens (5.06%), urban slum (1.9%) and urban areas (1.4%). Highest proportion of cholera (13.7%) was observed in 0-10 yr age group. Of them, 11.5 per cent belonged to 0-5 yr age group. V. cholerae O1 El Tor serotype Ogawa was the predominant isolate. Multiple drug-resistant isolates of V. cholerae O1 Ogawa were reported in the study. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Emergence of resistance amongst V. cholerae towards many antibiotics is a matter of concern. Hence, continuous surveillance for diarrhoeal disorders is necessary to control the future outbreaks of cholera in this region.",

			"abstract": "We aimed at identifying potential bacterial factors linking clostridia with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We compared the phenotypic traits, stress responses, cellular cytotoxicity, and inflammatory capabilities of the largest collection of Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium neonatale strains isolated from fecal samples of NEC preterm neonates (PN) and control PNs. When strain characteristics were used as explanatory variables, a statistical discriminant analysis allowed the separation of NEC and control strains into separate groups. Strains isolated from NEC PN were characterized by a higher viability at 30 degrees C (P = 0.03) and higher aerotolerance (P = 0.01), suggesting that NEC strains may have a competitive and/or survival advantage in the environmental gastrointestinal tract conditions of NEC PN. Heat-treated NEC bacteria induced higher production of interleukin-8 in Caco-2 cells (P = 0.03), suggesting proinflammatory activity. In vitro, bacteria, bacterial components, and fecal filtrates showed variable cytotoxic effects affecting the cellular network and/or cell viability, without specific association with NEC or control samples. Altogether, our data support the existence of a specific clostridial strain signature associated with NEC.IMPORTANCE Clostridia are part of the commensal microbiota in preterm neonates (PN). However, microbiota analyses by culture and metagenomics have linked necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and intestinal colonization with clostridial species. Nevertheless, little is known about the specific characteristics that may be shared by clostridia associated with NEC compared to commensal clostridia. Therefore, our goal was to identify specific bacterial factors linking clostridial strains with NEC. We report the existence of a specific bacterial signature associated with NEC and propose that activation of the innate immune response may be a unifying causative mechanism for the development of NEC independent of a specific pathogenic organism. The present study provides new insights into NEC pathophysiology that are needed for better diagnostics and strategies for implementing prevention of the disease.",

The aim of this study was to determine the molecular epidemiology of DEC among children with and without acute gastroenteritis in Davidson County, Tennessee. METHODS: This prospective, frequency matched, case-control study recruited subjects 15 days to 17 years of age and detected DEC with polymerase chain reaction from stool samples. Additional testing was done to define phylogenetics and antibiotics resistance. RESULTS: Among 1267 participants, 857 cases and 410 controls, 5.5% were positive for at least one subtype of DEC. Enteroaggregative E. coli [n = 32 (45%)] was the most common subtype followed by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) [n = 30 (43%)], Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [n = 4 (6%)] and diffusely adherent E. coli [n = 4 (6%)]. No significant difference in prevalence of DEC was found between cases (5%) and controls (7%) [odds ratio: 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.4-1.07)], and results were similar when data were stratified by subtypes and adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity. Substantial diversity was found among DEC isolates in terms of phylotypes and serotypes, and a large proportion was resistant to, at least, one antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Enteroaggregative E. coli and enteropathogenic E. coli were frequently found in both cases and controls in this study population. DNA-based methods for detection of these subtypes need further investigation to help differentiate between pathogenic and colonizing strains.",

			"article_name": "Approach to Infants Born Through Meconium Stained Amniotic Fluid: Evolution Based on Evidence?",
			"abstract": "Meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) during delivery is a marker of fetal stress. Neonates born through MSAF often need resuscitation and are at risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), air leaks, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and death. The neonatal resuscitation approach to MSAF has evolved over the last three decades. Previously, nonvigorous neonates soon after delivery were suctioned under the vocal cords with direct visualization technique using a meconium aspirator. The recent neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) recommends against suctioning but favors resuscitation with positive pressure ventilation of nonvigorous neonates with MSAF. This recommendation is aimed to prevent delay in resuscitation and minimize hypoxia-ischemia often associated with MSAF. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, evolution and the evidence, randomized control trials, observational studies, and translational research to support these recommendations. The frequency of ECMO use for neonatal respiratory indication of MAS has declined over the years probably secondary to improvements in neonatal intensive care and reduction of postmaturity. Changes in resuscitation practices may have contributed to reduced incidence and severity of MAS. Larger randomized controlled studies are needed among nonvigorous infants with MSAF. However, ethical dilemmas and loss of equipoise pose a challenge to conduct such studies.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sapovirus is one of the primary viral causes of acute gastroenteritis (AGE), especially where rotavirus vaccination has been implemented. The characteristics and impact of natural infection at the community level, however, have not been well documented. METHODS: Stool samples were analyzed from 100 children randomly selected from a community-based birth cohort study in Peru. All diarrheal and 1 nondiarrheal stools collected trimonthly from children up to age 2 years (n = 1669) were tested for sapovirus detection. Viral shedding duration was determined by testing additional weekly samples (n = 440) collected before and after a sapovirus-positive sample. RESULTS: The incidence of sapovirus infection in the first and second years of life was 4.3 and 11.1 per 100 child-months, respectively. By age 2 years, 82% of children had at least 1 sapovirus infection, and 64% had at least 1 sapovirus-associated diarrhea episode. The median shedding period was 18.5 days. In 112 of 175 infections, 14 genotypes from 4 genogroups (GI, GII, GIV, and GV) were determined. Among genogroups, GI were more frequently found in symptomatic infections than in asymptomatic infections (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-7.4). Fifty-nine children had serial sapovirus infections, but only 3 had repeated infection of the same genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Sapovirus was frequently detected in children with AGE at the community level during the first 2 years of life. Serial sapovirus infections by multiple genotypes in a child suggest genotype-specific immunity from each infection, which needs to be taken into account for vaccine development.",

The purpose of this analysis is to report from the sentinel surveillance system for rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE), which collects information on the epidemiology and circulating genotypes to assess the disease burden and support vaccine introduction in Myanmar. METHODS: Prospective, active surveillance for RVGE-associated hospitalizations was conducted during 2009 -2014 at Yangon Children's Hospital. Stool samples collected from children <5\u202fyears of age admitted for AGE were screened for rotavirus antigen by ELISA (ProSpecT Rotavirus, OXOID-UK). G and P genotyping was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Overall, 1860/3724 (49.9%) of stool samples tested positive for rotavirus, ranging from 42-56% of hospitalized AGE cases each year. RVGE was predominant in the 6-11\u202fmonths age group 889/1860 (47.8%) as compared with 12-23\u202fmonths 633/1860 (34.0%), 0-5 months 226/1860 (12.2 %) and 24-59\u202fmonths 112/1860 (6.0%). RVGE occurred in a seasonal cycle with peak occurrence in the cold and dry months (November to February), accounting for 65.3% (1151/1763) among enrolled AGE cases. Vomiting (84.1% Vs 67.9%; P\u202f<\u202f.01), fever (84.5% Vs 75.6%; P\u202f<\u202f.01) and dehydration (78% Vs 69%; P\u202f<\u202f.01) were more frequently observed in RVGE than non-RVGE. Genotyping revealed that G1P[8] was predominant from January to June 2009, G12P[8] was predominant throughout 2009-2012 which was replaced in 2012-2013 by G2P[4] and changed again to G1P[8] in 2013-2014 and G9P[8] in late 2014. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus is accounting for approximately half of AGE-associated hospitalizations among children <5\u202fyears of age in Myanmar. There is immense diversity of rotavirus strains similar to that reported previously for other countries in the region.

Here, we examined the influence of nutrition and common practices on the gut microbiota and growth in a cohort of preterm infants. RESULTS: With weekly gut microbiota samples spanning postmenstrual age (PMA) 24 to 46 weeks, we developed two models to test associations between the microbiota, nutrition and growth: a categorical model with three successive microbiota phases (P1, P2, and P3) and a model with two periods (early and late PMA) defined by microbiota composition and PMA, respectively. The more significant associations with phase led us to use a phase-based framework for the majority of our analyses. Phase transitions were characterized by rapid shifts in the microbiota, with transition out of P1 occurring nearly simultaneously with the change from meconium to normal stool. The rate of phase progression was positively associated with gestational age at birth, and delayed transition to a P3 microbiota was associated with growth failure. We found distinct bacterial metabolic functions in P1-3 and significant associations between nutrition, microbiota phase, and infant growth. CONCLUSION: The phase-dependent impact of nutrition on infant growth along with phase-specific metabolic functions suggests a pioneering potential for improving growth outcomes by tailoring nutrient intake to microbiota phase.",

Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the sub cohort of NE that appears to be driven by intrapartum events. Our objective was to identify antepartum and intrapartum factors associated with the development of neonatal HIE. METHODS: Hospital databases were searched using relevant diagnosis codes to identify infants with neonatal encephalopathy. Cases were infants with encephalopathy and evidence of intrapartum hypoxia. For each hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy case, four controls were randomly selected from all deliveries that occurred within 6 months of the case. RESULTS: Twenty-six cases met criteria for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy between 2002 and 2014. In multivariate analysis, meconium-stained amniotic fluid (aOR 12.4, 95% CI 2.1-144.8, p = 0.002), prolonged second stage of labor (aOR 9.5, 95% CI 1.0-135.3, p = 0.042), and the occurrence of a sentinel or acute event (aOR 74.9, 95% CI 11.9-infinity, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The presence of a category 3 fetal heart rate tracing in any of the four 15-min segments during the hour prior to delivery (28.0% versus 4.0%, p = 0.002) was more common among hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy cases. CONCLUSION: Prolonged second stage of labor and the presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid are risk factors for the development of HIE. Close scrutiny should be paid to labors that develop these features especially in the presence of an abnormal fetal heart tracing. Acute events also account for a substantial number of HIE cases and health systems should develop programs that can optimize the response to these emergencies.",

Both strains were pink-orange coloured, Gram-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive, facultative anaerobic and motile bacteria, produced H2S and reduced nitrates to nitrites. Growth occurred in the presence of 0-9 % (w/v) NaCl and at 10-42  degrees C. The optimum conditions were with 1 % (w/v) NaCl and at 35  degrees C. The phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA gene demonstrated that strains 08MAS2251(T) and LZ2016-166 clustered in a distinctive clade next to the species Shewanella chilikensis JC5(T) within the genus Shewanella. Meanwhile, gyrB gene sequence analysis indicated that the two strains formed an independent branch that was clearly separate from all the other Shewanella species with sequence similarities from 68.49 to 95.74 %. The DNA G+C content of strain 08MAS2251(T) was 52.68 mol%. Genomic relatedness of in silico DNA-DNA hybridization between strain 08MAS2251(T) and phylogenetic neighbours ranged from 50.5-51.8 %, below the cutoff of 70 %. In addition, corresponding average nucleotide identity values were between 93.01 to 93.49%, which were lower than 95 % threshold. The major fatty acids of strain 08MAS2251(T) were C17 : 1omega8c (27.2 %), iso-C15 : 0 (22.5 %), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1omega6c and/or C16 : 1omega7c; 8.7 %), C16 : 0 (6.2 %), iso-C13 : 0 (5.6 %) and C17 : 0 (4.5 %). Based on phenotypic and genetic analysis, strains 08MAS2251(T) and LZ2016-166 are identified as a novel species of the genus Shewanella, for which the name Shewanellacarassii sp. nov. is proposed.

Ukraine joined the World Health Organization's Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network in 2006, with a goal of providing accurate rotavirus burden data to aid policy makers in planning for rotavirus vaccine introduction. This analysis describes rotavirus epidemiology among Ukrainian children enrolled in Kyiv and Odesa, two large Ukrainian cities. METHODS: Children 0-59\u202fmonths of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis at 2 sentinel sites in Kyiv and Odesa were enrolled into the active, prospective surveillance program. In Odesa, the surveillance period was during 2007-2015 and in Kyiv, it was during 2011-2015. Acute gastroenteritis was defined as 3 or more episodes of diarrhea per day during a 24 h period, with symptom duration before hospitalization not exceeding 7\u202fdays. Guardians of enrolled children completed a questionnaire including demographic, clinical and treatment information. Each child provided a stool specimen within 2\u202fdays of hospitalization. Stools were tested for rotavirus using ProSpecT Rotavirus Kit (Oxoid Ltd., Great Britain), and positive specimens were genotyped. Descriptive data are reported, as well as comparison of demographic, clinical and treatment data among rotavirus positive and negative children. RESULTS: During July 2007-June 2015, 12,350 children were enrolled in the surveillance programs and had stool specimens collected and tested for rotavirus. Overall, rotavirus infection was diagnosed in 5412/12350 (44%) of children, 929/1734 (54%) of those in Kyiv and 4483/10616 (42%) in Odesa. Rotavirus infections peaked during the winter months. Children with rotavirus acute gastroenteritis displayed more severe clinical symptoms than those without rotavirus. Predominant genotypes identified included G1P[8], G2P[4], G3 P[8], G4 P[8] and G9 P[8].

In parallel, the concentration of a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and immunoglobulins were determined in meconium and fecal samples. Globally, a higher bacterial diversity and a lower interindividual variability were observed in 2-year-olds' feces, when compared to the samples obtained during their first days of life. Hospital-associated fecal bacteria, that were dominant during the NICU stay, seemed to be replaced, two years later, by genera, which are usually predominant in the healthy adult microbiome. The immune profile of the meconium and fecal samples differed, depending on the sampling time, showing different immune maturation statuses of the gut.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this study, we examined the effectiveness of RV1 and RV5 vaccines during an outbreak of G8P[8] rotavirus group A strain (G8P[8]-RVA). These vaccines were originally designed to provide protection against severe diseases caused by common circulating strains, whereas G8P[8]-RVA remains emerging strain and partially heterotypic to the vaccines. It is imperative to investigate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against G8P[8]-RVA because this strain appears to be predominant in recent years, particularly, in post-vaccine era. METHODS: RVA infection and genotypes were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence-based genotyping. VE was determined during an outbreak of G8P[8]-RVA in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, in February-July 2017, retrospectively, by comparing vaccination status of children suffering from acute gastroenteritis (AGE) between 'PCR-positive' and 'PCR-negative' cases using conditional logistic regression adjusted for age. RESULTS: Among 80 AGE children, RVA was detected in 58 (73%), of which 53 (66%) was G8P[8]-RVA. The clinical characteristics of G8P[8]-RVA and other RVA strains were identically severe. Notably, the attack rates of G8P[8]-RVA in vaccinated (61.1%) and unvaccinated (65.5%) children were almost similar. Indeed, no substantial effectiveness were found against G8P[8]-RVA (VE, 14% [95% CI: -140% to 70%]) or other RVA strains (VE, 58% [95% CI: -20% to 90%]) for mild infections. However, these vaccines remained strongly effective against moderate (VE, 75% [95% CI: 1% to 40%]) and severe (VE, 92% [95% CI: 60% to 98%]) RVA infections. The disease severity including Vesikari score, duration and frequency of diarrhea, and body temperature were significantly lower in vaccinated children. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of current RV vaccines against moderate and severe, but not against the mild infections during an outbreak caused by unusual G8P[8]-RVA, which was virtually not targeted in the vaccines.",

Here, we present a genome-resolved metagenomic study of microbial genotypes from the gastrointestinal tracts of infants and from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) room environment. Some strains detected in hospitalized infants also occur in sinks and on surfaces, and belong to species such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are frequently implicated in nosocomial infection and preterm infant gut colonization. Of the 15 K. pneumoniae strains detected in the study, four were detected in both infant gut and room samples. Time series experiments showed that nearly all strains associated with infant gut colonization can be detected in the room after, and often before, detection in the gut. Thus, we conclude that a component of premature infant gut colonization is the cycle of microbial exchange between the room and the occupant.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether features of the infant intestinal microbiome, including the carriage of toxigenic bacteria, are associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). STUDY DESIGN: We undertook a case-controlled analysis of fecal microbiology in SIDS. Fecal material was obtained from 44 cases and 44 aged-matched controls. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and comparisons between cases and controls made based on both bacterial alpha diversity measures and unconstrained ordination. Specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine intestinal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus, toxigenic Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic and nonpathogenic Escherichia coli. RESULTS: The microbial composition for the study population as a whole was consistent with previous studies of infants <12 months of age, with a correlation between alpha diversity and age (r(2) = 0.08; P = .007). However, no difference was observed in alpha diversity between SIDS cases and controls (P > .4). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling also revealed no evidence of differences in microbiota dispersal between SIDS cases and controls (P = .4, permutational multivariate ANOVA test; Pseudo-F = 0.9), nor was a difference observed in microbiota dispersion (P = .19, PERMDISP test; F = 1.9). There were no significant intergroup differences in the carriage of S aureus, toxigenic C difficile, total E coli, or pathogenic E coli. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an association between altered intestinal microbiology and SIDS, or to support the development of strategies to reduce the incidence of SIDS that target intestinal microbiology.",

METHODS: Pentavalent (RV5) or monovalent (RV1) rotavirus vaccine was administered to infants admitted to the NICU. Nineteen vaccinated infants and 49 unvaccinated infants whose beds were located in close proximity to the vaccinated infants were enrolled in this study. Dissemination and fecal shedding of vaccine viruses within the NICU were examined using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Shedding of the vaccine strain was detected in all 19 vaccinated infants. RV5 virus shedding started 1 day after the first vaccination and persisted for 8 days after the first vaccination, and viral shedding terminated by day 5 after administration of the second RV5 dose. The kinetics of RV1 virus shedding differed among vaccinated infants. The duration of RV1 virus shedding was longer after the first vaccination than after the second vaccination. In contrast to the vaccinated infants, no vaccine virus genomes were detected in any of the stool samples collected from the 49 unvaccinated infants.

			"abstract": "Conjugative plasmids represent major reservoirs for horizontal transmission of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Our knowledge about the ecology and persistence of these plasmids in the gut microbiota remains limited. The IncF plasmids are the most widespread in clinical samples and in healthy humans and the main aim of this work was to study their ecology and association with the developing gut microbiota. Using a longitudinal (2, 10, 30 and 90 days) cohort of full-term infants, we investigated the transmission and persistence of IncFIA and IncFIB plasmids. The prevalence of IncFIB plasmids was higher than IncFIA in the cohort, while IncFIA always co-occurred with IncFIB. However, the relative gene abundance of IncFIA was significantly higher than IncFIB for all time points, indicating that IncFIA may be a higher copy-number plasmid. Through linear discriminant analysis effect size and operational taxonomic unit-level associations, we observed major differences in the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in samples positive and negative for IncFIB. This association was significant at 2, 10 and 30 days and showed an association with vaginal delivery. From shot-gun analyses, we assembled de novo multi-replicon shared (IncFIA/IncFIB) and integrated (IncFIA/IB) plasmids that were persistent through the dataset. Overall, the study demonstrates the nature of IncF plasmids in complex microbial communities.",

While this detection may have a clinical significance, other factors may influence the stool positivity for influenza viruses. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate demographical, clinical, and microbiological factors which could favor the presence of influenza viral RNA in the stools of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. METHODS: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) patients were enrolled by general practitioners (GP) during two winter seasons (2014-2016). Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens, and clinical data were collected. Samples were tested for 12 respiratory pathogen groups (nasopharyngeal and stool specimens) and for 12 enteric pathogens (stool specimens). RESULTS: Among the 331 patients with ARI enrolled by GP, 114 (34.4%) presented influenza infection. Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 21% (24/114) of the 114 stool specimens analyzed. Hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.8 (95% confidence interval (CI)) [1.7-33.7], P = .02), age between 45 and 64 years (aOR = 4.8 [1.7-14.5], P = .01), consumption of raw shellfish and/or mollusks (aOR = 16.7 [3.6-90.9], P = .00), and use of antibiotics (aOR = 6.4 [2.1-19.8], P = .006) or antiviral treatment (aOR = 7.4 [1.9-29], P = .01) were significantly associated with an increased odds of the detection of influenza RNA in stools.

Healthy term infants, born within 14 days of the study's commencement, were randomly assigned to be fed IWP-F or HWP-F until 13 weeks of age, and breast-fed (BF) infants were enrolled as a reference group. Anthropometric measurements, gastrointestinal tolerance indexes and stool characteristics were assessed at baseline, and 7 and 13 weeks of age. There were no significant differences in any growth measurements and the occurrence of crying, spit-up and difficult defecation among the three feeding groups during the study period. However, daily feeding frequency was consistently lower in the formula-fed infants than in the BF group throughout the study (p < 0.05), and infants in the HWP-F group consumed more formula than those in the IWP-F group at 7 and 13 weeks of age (p </= 0.002). The HWP-F-fed infants had more similar stool characteristics to the breast-fed infants than infants in the IWP-F group at 13 weeks of age, regardless of frequency, volume, color or consistency of stool. This study demonstrates that the HWP-F could support the normal growth of healthy term infants, to a comparable extent to that of breast-fed infants during the first three months of life. Moreover, stool characteristics of HWP-F-fed infants are much closer to breast-fed infants than IWP-F-fed infants, but no significant gastrointestinal tolerance improvement was observed in HWP-F group.",

We investigated whether maternal vitamin D supplemention, maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, or direct supplementation of the infant influences key bacterial taxa within microbiota of one month old infants. Infant and maternal vitamin D supplement use was ascertained via questionnaires. Maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D was determined at approximately the 36th week of pregnancy. In 913 one month old infants in the prospective KOALA Birth Cohort Study, fecal Bifidobacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis group, Lactobacillus spp. and total bacteria were quantified with real-time polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences. The association between vitamin D exposure and prevalence or abundance of a specific bacterial group or species was analyzed using logistic or linear regression, respectively. There was a statistically significant negative linear trend between counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and levels of maternal vitamin D supplementation and maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D quintiles, respectively. In addition, a positive linear trend between quintile groups and B. fragilis group counts was observed. Lower counts of C. difficile were associated with vitamin D supplementation of breast fed infants whose mothers were more likely to adhere to an alternative lifestyle in terms of, e.g., dietary habits. These data suggest that vitamin D influences the abundance of several key bacterial taxa within the infant microbiota. Given that intestinal microbiotic homeostasis may be an important factor in the prevention of immune mediated diseases and that vitamin D status is a modifiable factor, further investigation of the impact of postnatal vitamin D supplementation should be conducted in older infants.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite declining risk of vertical HIV transmission, prophylactic cotrimoxazole (CTX) remains widely used to reduce morbidity and mortality in the event of HIV infection among exposed infants, with an inherent risk of conferring commensal antimicrobial resistance. Using data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of infant CTX prophylaxis, we sought to quantify emergence of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: HIV-exposed uninfected infants enrolled in the Botswana Mpepu study were randomized to prophylactic CTX or placebo between 14 and 34 days of life and continued through 15 months. Stool samples were collected from a subset of participating infants at randomization, three, and six months, and stored at -70 degrees C prior to culture. Specimens that grew Escherichia coli (E. coli) or Klebsiella species (Klebsiella spp.) underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing by Kirby Bauer method using CTX (CTX 1.25/23.75 mug) and Amoxicillin (10 mug) in Mueller Hinton agar. Fisher's exact testing was used to compare prevalence of resistance by randomization arm (CTX/placebo). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 381 stool samples from 220 infants were cultured: 118 at randomization, 151 at three months, and 112 at six-months. E. coli was isolated from 206 specimens and Klebsiella spp. from 138 specimens. Resistance to CTX was common in both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. at the randomization visit (52.2% and 37.7% respectively) and did not differ by study arm. E. Coli isolates from CTX recipients at three and six months had 94.9% and 84.2% CTX resistance, as compared with 51.4% and 57.5% CTX resistance in isolates from placebo recipients (p=0.01). Klebsiella spp. isolates from CTX recipients had 79.0% and 68.8% CTX resistance at three and six months, as compared with 19.1% and 14.3% in isolates from placebo recipients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-exposed infants randomized to CTX prophylaxis had increased CTX-resistant commensal gastrointestinal bacteria compared with placebo recipients. Additional research is needed to determine the longer-term clinical, microbiologic, and public health consequences of antimicrobial resistance selected by infant CTX prophylaxis.",

We observed an overall reduction in median crying time, regardless of L. reuteri colonization status (n = 14 colonized). There were no differences in E. coli colonization rates or densities, microbial diversity or intestinal inflammation by L. reuteri colonization status. We found that L. reuteri density positively correlated with crying time, and E. coli density negatively correlated with microbial diversity. As density of L. reuteri was associated with increased crying time, L. reuteri supplementation may not be an appropriate treatment for all infants with colic.",

From 320 diarrhoea cases enrolled between March and August 2016, 33 (10.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4-12.4) cases were stool culture-positive for non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica. The most commonly identified serovar was Typhimurium (54%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of Salmonella infection in children from households supplied by pipe water was 4.7 (95% CI 1.6-13.9) times higher compared with those supplied with reverse osmosis treated water. Similarly, children from households with domestic animals were found to have a higher odds (OR 10.5; 95% CI 3.8-28.4) of being Salmonella stool culture-positive. The likelihood of Salmonella infection was higher (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.0-6.4) among children belonging to caregiver with primary vs. tertiary education levels. Lower odds (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.1-0.9) of Salmonella infection were associated with children exclusively breast fed as compared with those exclusively bottle fed. Salmonella infection was three times lower (95% CI 0.1-0.7) in children belonging to caregiver who reported always washing hands after cleaning children following defecation, vs. those belonging to caregivers who did not wash hands. The antimicrobial resistance profile by disc diffusion revealed that non-susceptibility to tetracycline (78.8%), azithromycin (66.7%) and ciprofloxacin (57.6%) were the most commonly seen, and 84.9% of Salmonella isolates were classified as multi-drug resistant. This is the first study on prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella infection among children in this setting.

			"article_name": "Optimisation of 16S rRNA gut microbiota profiling of extremely low birth weight infants.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infants born prematurely, particularly extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW) have altered gut microbial communities. Factors such as maternal health, gut immaturity, delivery mode, and antibiotic treatments are associated with microbiota disturbances, and are linked to an increased risk of certain diseases such as necrotising enterocolitis. Therefore, there is a requirement to optimally characterise microbial profiles in this at-risk cohort, via standardisation of methods, particularly for studying the influence of microbiota therapies (e.g. probiotic supplementation) on community profiles and health outcomes. Profiling of faecal samples using the 16S rRNA gene is a cost-efficient method for large-scale clinical studies to gain insights into the gut microbiota and additionally allows characterisation of cohorts were sample quantities are compromised (e.g. ELBW infants). However, DNA extraction method, and the 16S rRNA region targeted can significantly change bacterial community profiles obtained, and so confound comparisons between studies. Thus, we sought to optimise a 16S rRNA profiling protocol to allow standardisation for studying ELBW infant faecal samples, with or without probiotic supplementation. METHODS: Using ELBW faecal samples, we compared three different DNA extraction methods, and subsequently PCR amplified and sequenced three hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (V1 + V2 + V3), (V4 + V5) and (V6 + V7 + V8), and compared two bioinformatics approaches to analyse results (OTU and paired end). Paired shotgun metagenomics was used as a 'gold-standard'. RESULTS: Results indicated a longer bead-beating step was required for optimal bacterial DNA extraction and that sequencing regions (V1 + V2 + V3) and (V6 + V7 + V8) provided the most representative taxonomic profiles, which was confirmed via shotgun analysis. Samples sequenced using the (V4 + V5) region were found to be underrepresented in specific taxa including Bifidobacterium, and had altered diversity profiles. Both bioinformatics 16S rRNA pipelines used in this study (OTU and paired end) presented similar taxonomic profiles at genus level. CONCLUSIONS: We determined that DNA extraction from ELBW faecal samples, particularly those infants receiving probiotic supplementation, should include a prolonged beat-beating step. Furthermore, use of the 16S rRNA (V1 + V2 + V3) and (V6 + V7 + V8) regions provides reliable representation of ELBW microbiota profiles, while inclusion of the (V4 + V5) region may not be appropriate for studies where Bifidobacterium constitutes a resident microbiota member.",

			"abstract": "The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is the initial non-invasive investigation of choice for population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We evaluated the positivity rate in repeated tests using the same fecal specimen that showed borderline results in the FIT. A total of 6,465 patients were tested with the FIT in a tertiary-care hospital from July to December 2016. FIT was done using OC-Sensor PLEDIA (Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Among 6,465 patients, 364 (5.6%) patients showed a positive FIT result of over 20 mug Hb/g feces. A total of 112 (1.7%) patients showed borderline scores of 10.2-20 mug Hb/g feces, and 5,989 (92.6%) patients showed negative results of less than 10 mug Hb/g feces. Among the 101 repeat-tested patients, 19 (18.8%) of the patients' scores converted to levels above the positive cut-off threshold. Repeated results of 19 patients showed score elevations from 20.2 to 68 mug Hb/g feces. These results suggest that it is most important to analyze properly prepared samples, even if only once. Therefore, the laboratory staff should ensure the proper preparation of stool specimens for FIT. Laboratory directors should choose the best cut-off value for detecting CRC at their respective institutions.",

			"abstract": "There are very few studies that have assessed multiple viral agents causing Acute-Gastroenteritis (AGE) in India. The present study compared the changing pattern of prevalence and genetic diversity of five enteric viruses associated with acute-diarrhea in Delhi children within a gap of 5 years. Fecal samples were collected from diarrheal children (<4 years) during two winter seasons: year 2009-2010 (n = 59) and year 2014-2015 (n = 85). Samples were individually tested for rotavirus-A, norovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, and sapovirus using EIA/RT-PCR and genetically characterized by phylogenetic analysis. Rotavirus was the most predominant (54.9%) virus followed by norovirus (25.7%), astrovirus (8.3%), and adenovirus (4.9%) with rare detection of sapovirus (0.7%). While detection rate increased for both rotavirus (49.2-58.8%) and astrovirus (5.1-10.6%), norovirus detection rate decreased (30.5-22.4%) from 2009 to 2015. During the same time period, adenovirus detection remained low (4.7-5.1%). Interestingly, mixed infections increased from 8.5% to 16.5% after 5 years. G1P[8] rotavirus strain was found most predominant (40%). Both type-1 and 8 astroviruses were detected. Single sapovirus detected was of genotype GII.1. Both GI (GI.5, GI.3) and GII (GII.1, GII.4, GII.7, GII.21, GII.13) genogroups of norovirus were detected. Of particular significance was the first detection of other NoV genotypes (besides GII.4 and GI.3) in Delhi. This is also the first report of NoV GI.5 from India. A change in prevalence pattern and increased diversity from 2009 to 2015 emphasizes the need for continued enteric virus surveillance to help measure the impact of new diarrhea vaccine(s) introduced in India.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the prevalence, genetic diversity, and association with diarrhea of HPeV in Ghanaian children. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 682 stool samples from a pediatric case-control study on causes of diarrhea collected in 2007-2008 were used. Laboratory analysis included HPeV real-time RT-PCR and sequencing partial viral protein (VP) 1 gene region of HPeV. In addition, data on co-infections using the xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel were available. RESULTS: Overall, a prevalence of 24% was found and 14 different HPeV types were detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region indicated a novel type tentatively designated as HPeV-18. No association with diarrhea was found (OR=0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.1), and HPeV viral concentrations were not different among cases and controls. No seasonal pattern was observed. HPeV-positive cases displayed a slightly higher chance of co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence and genetic diversity of HPeV including novel types was found by sequencing partial VP 1 region. HPeV was not associated with diarrheal disease in this pediatric population and the high number of co-infection suggests transient colonization without clinical relevance.",

Microbiota analysis was performed by means of IS-pro technique on fecal samples collected at 28 days postnatally.ResultsVOC profiles of infants developing severe BPD (n=15) could be discriminated from matched controls (n=15) at postnatal age of 14 days (area under the curve (+/-95% confidence interval), P-value, sensitivity, specificity; 0.72 (0.54-0.90), 0.040, 60.0%, 73.3%), 21 days (0.71 (0.52-0.90), 0.049, 66.7%, 73.3%) and 28 days (0.77 (0.59-0.96), 0.017, 69.2%, 69.2%) but not at 7 days. Intestinal microbiota did not differ between BPD subjects and controls.ConclusionFecal VOC profiles of infants developing BPD could be differentiated from controls at postnatal day 14, 21, and 28. VOC differences could not be directed to intestinal microbiota alterations but presumably reflect local and systemic metabolic and inflammatory pathways associated with BPD.",

			"abstract": "Clostridium species (particularly Clostridium difficile, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani and Clostridium perfringens) are associated with a range of human and animal diseases. Several other species including Clostridium tertium, Clostridium cadaveris, and Clostridium paraputrificum have also been linked with sporadic human infections, however there is very limited, or in some cases, no genomic information publicly available. Thus, we isolated one C. tertium strain, one C. cadaveris strain and three C. paraputrificum strains from preterm infants residing within neonatal intensive care units and performed Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) using Illumina HiSeq. In this report, we announce the open availability of the draft genomes: C. tertium LH009, C. cadaveris LH052, C. paraputrificum LH025, C. paraputrificum LH058, and C. paraputrificum LH141. These genomes were checked for contamination in silico to ensure purity, and we confirmed species identity and phylogeny using both 16S rRNA gene sequences (from PCR and in silico) and WGS-based approaches. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) was used to differentiate genomes from their closest relatives to further confirm speciation boundaries. We also analysed the genomes for virulence-related factors and antimicrobial resistance genes, and detected presence of tetracycline and methicillin resistance, and potentially harmful enzymes, including multiple phospholipases and toxins. The availability of genomic data in open databases, in tandem with our initial insights into the genomic content and virulence traits of these pathogenic Clostridium species, should enable the scientific community to further investigate the disease-causing mechanisms of these bacteria with a view to enhancing clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Rotavirus vaccines were launched in Taiwan since early 2006. Our study was aimed to figure out long-term extended molecular epidemiology in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in hospitalized young children after rotavirus vaccination in Taiwan. METHODS: During the 10-year period from January 2007 to December 2016, fecal samples from children under 5 years old with AGE hospitalized in Chang Gung Children's Hospital (CGCH) were examined for enteric pathogens and they were divided into two time intervals: early post-vaccine (Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2011; EPV) and late post-vaccine (Jan. 2012 to Dec. 2016; LPV). RESULTS: In total, 837 patients with AGE were enrolled with complete study. In the EPV period, 106 (26.7%) rotavirus and 65 (16.4%) norovirus infections were identified as major pathogens. In the LPV period, 79 (17.9%) rotavirus and 98 (22.2%) norovirus infections were diagnosed. Statistical analyses showed a significantly decreased prevalence of rotavirus infection (P = 0.002) and a significantly increased prevalence of norovirus (P = 0.034) and enteric bacterial infections (P < 0.001). A substantial decrease of rotavirus G1 (P = 0.079) in the LPV period and norovirus GII.4 prevailed through the decade. CONCLUSION: In Taiwan, under a suboptimal rotavirus vaccination policy, there was a marked decrease in the rate of rotavirus AGE of hospitalized young children. Significantly increased norovirus infection has replaced rotavirus as the leading cause. Expansion of rotavirus vaccine coverage, development of a norovirus prevention strategy, and sustained bacterial infection control are important for AGE containment in children in Taiwan.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis japonica remains a major public health and socioeconomic concern in Southeast Asia. Sensitive and accurate diagnostics can play a pivotal role in achieving disease elimination goals. METHODS: We previously reported a novel droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay targeting the mitochondrial gene nad1 to diagnose schistosomiasis japonica. The tool identified both prepatent and patent infections using Schistosoma japonicum DNA isolated from serum, urine, salivary glands, and feces in a murine model. The assay was validated here using clinical samples collected from 412 subjects resident in an area moderately endemic for schistosomiasis in the Philippines. RESULTS: S. japonicum DNA present in human stool, serum, urine, and saliva was detected quantitatively with high sensitivity. The capability to diagnose cases of human schistosomiasis using noninvasively collected clinical samples, the higher level of sensitivity obtained compared with the microscopy-based Kato-Katz test, and the capacity to quantify infection intensity have important public health implications for schistosomiasis control and programs targeting other neglected tropical diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This verified ddPCR method represents a valuable new tool for the diagnosis and surveillance of schistosomiasis, particularly in low-prevalence and low-intensity areas approaching elimination and in monitoring where disease emergence or re-emergence is a concern.",

			"abstract": "Few studies have analyzed the gut microbiota of child in unindustrialized countries, but none during the first month of life. Stool samples were collected from healthy newborns in hospitals of Gabon (n = 6) and Republic of the Congo (n = 9) at different time points during the first month of life: meconium, day 2 (D02), day 7 (D07) and day 28 (D28). In addition, one fecal sample was collected from each mother after delivery. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to determine the bacterial communities, and multiplex real-time PCR was used to detect the presence of seven enteric viruses (rotavirus a, adenovirus, norovirus I and II, sapovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus) in these samples. Bacterial diversity was high in the first days of life, and was dominated by the genus Prevotella. Then, it rapidly decreased and remained low up to D28 when the gut flora was composed almost exclusively of strictly anaerobic bacteria. Each infant's fecal bacterial microbiota composition was significantly closer to that of their mother than to that of any other woman in the mothers' group, suggesting an intrauterine, placental or amniotic fluid origin of such bacteria. Moreover, bacterial communities differed according to the delivery mode. Overall, the bacterial microbiota communities displayed a similar diversification and expansion in newborns within and between countries during the first four weeks of life. Moreover, six of the fifteen infants of this study harbored enteric viruses (rotavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus) in fecal samples, but never in the meconium. A maternal source for the viruses detected at D02 and D07 can be excluded because none of them was found also in the child's mother. These findings improve our knowledge on the gut bacterial and viral communities of infants from two Sub-Saharan countries during their first month of life.",

			"abstract": "AIM: To use prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to define features of meconium peritonitis (MP) and analyse the relationship between prenatal MRI findings and postnatal outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight cases were enrolled who had been diagnosed with MP through prenatal MRI; the diagnoses were confirmed at surgery and pathology or follow-up. MP was diagnosed by the findings of meconium ascites, meconium pseudocyst, or dilated bowel loops. Prenatal follow-up after diagnosis by MRI was performed by ultrasound. RESULTS: Prenatal MRI findings included massive meconium ascites (five out of eight cases), a small meconium pseudocyst (one out of eight), a large meconium pseudocyst along with a dilated bowel loop (one out of eight), a dilated bowel loop alone (one out of eight), and micro-colorectum (six out of eight). Six fetuses showed abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, and no normal meconium at birth; they underwent exploratory laparotomies and subsequently, survived and prospered. Only one fetus (with a small meconium pseudocyst) received conservative treatment. There was one mortality, and the cause of death was full-bowel necrosis. CONCLUSION: Prenatal MRI may be helpful for diagnosing MP, in cases where the specific MRI findings are persistent meconium ascites, a dilated bowel loop, micro-colorectum, and meconium pseudocyst. In particular, a micro-colorectum might indirectly reflect ileum atresia, which requires postnatal surgery.",

METHODS: This study compared 11 infants with NEC and 11 controls, all born at 27-35 weeks, in three neonatal intensive care units between January 2013 and March 2015. Faecal samples were collected at key time points, and microbiota was analysed by culture, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and temperature temporal gel electrophoresis (TTGE). RESULTS: The cultures revealed that all preterm infants were poorly colonised and harboured no more than seven species. Prior to NEC diagnosis, significant differences were observed by qPCR with a higher colonisation by staphylococci (p = 0.034) and lower colonisations by enterococci (p = 0.039) and lactobacilli (p = 0.048) in the NEC group compared to the healthy controls. Throughout the study, virtually all of the infants were colonised by Enterobacteriaceae at high levels. TTGE analysis revealed no particular clusterisation, showing high interindividual variability. CONCLUSION: The NEC infants were poorly colonised with no more than seven species, and the controls had a more diversified and balanced gut microbiota. Understanding NEC aetiology better could lead to more effective prophylactic interventions and a reduced incidence.",

			"abstract": "Nigeria having approximately 50 000 Rotavirus A (RVA) deaths annually is yet to introduce RVA vaccine into routine national immunization; therefore surveillance of RVA strains circulating before vaccine introduction is essential in evaluating impact of the intervention. Stool samples and sociodemographic data of diarrhoeic children, <5 years were collected between August 2012 and December 2013. While a high prevalence of RVA infection (47.6%; 49/103) was observed by quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR, only 25% (26/103) had high RVA genome concentrations and were antigen positive. G and P types were obtained for 31 and 37 samples respectively. G12P[8] strains were predominant (30.6%; 16/31); Other genotypes found included G9, G3, G2 and P[4], P[6], P[8]. A G12 + G2/P[8] + P[6] mixed infection was detected. The P[8] genotype showed divergence with strains distributed in lineage III and IV. Compared to the vaccines, changes in antigenic sites of VP8* and VP7 were found. The finding of the G2P[6] genotype combination and emergence of G12 strains support observations in most of the recent RVA studies from Africa. P[6] is common in many African countries, in contrast to countries in Europe and the Americas. In conclusion, this study shows the circulation of other RVA genotypes compared to the common RVA genotypes in Nigeria. PCR results should be interpreted with caution to avoid significant bias from samples with low RVA genome concentrations. These findings provide important information on the detection and molecular epidemiology of RVA prior to vaccination and contribute as a baseline for future evaluations after possible vaccine introduction.",

Effectiveness of the vaccines has been confirmed, whereas concerns such as shedding of the vaccine strains and gastroenteritis cases caused by vaccine strains are not well assessed. We aimed to identify the vaccine strains in children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) to investigate the prevalence of AGE caused by vaccination or horizontal transmission of vaccine strains. A total of 1,824 stool samples were collected from children with AGE at six outpatient clinics in 2012-2015. Among all, 372 group A rotavirus (RVA) positive samples were screened for vaccine components by real-time RT-PCR which were designed to differentiate vaccine strains from rotavirus wild-type strains with high specificity. For samples possessing both vaccine and wild-type strains, analyses by next-generation sequencing (NGS) were conducted to characterize viruses existed in the intestine. As a result, Rotarix-derived strains were identified in 6 of 372 (1.6%) RVA positive samples whereas no RotaTeq strain was detected. Among six samples, four possessed Rotarix-derived strains while two possessed both Rotarix-derived strains and wild-type strains. In addition, other pathogens such as norovirus, enterovirus and E.coli were detected in four samples. The contribution of these vaccine strains to each patient's symptoms was unclear as all of the cases were vaccinated 2-14 days before sample collection. Proportion of average coverage for each segmented gene by NGS strongly suggested the concurrent infection of the vaccine-derived strain and the wild-type strain rather than reassortment of these two strains in one sample. This is the first study to report the prevalence of vaccine-derived strains in patients with RVA AGE in Japan as 1.6% without evidence of horizontal transmission. The results emphasized the importance of continuous monitoring on vaccine strains and their clinical impacts on children.",

Hence, we aim to identify non-polio enteroviruses recovered from the faeces of children diagnosed with AFP in Nigeria. METHODS: Ninety-six isolates, (95 unidentified and one previously confirmed Sabin poliovirus 3) recovered on RD cell culture from the stool of children <15 years old diagnosed with AFP in 2014 were analyzed. All isolates were subjected to RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and three different PCR reactions (one panenterovirus 5'-UTR and two different VP1 amplification assays). VP1 amplicons were then sequenced and isolates identified. RESULTS: 92.71% (89/96) of the isolates were detected by at least one of the three assays as an enterovirus. Precisely, 79.17% (76/96), 6.25% (6/96), 7.30% (7/96) and 7.30% (7/96) of the isolates were positive for both, positive and negative, negative and positive, as well as negative for both the 5'-UTR and VP1 assays, respectively. In this study, sixty-nine (69) of the 83 VP1 amplicons sequenced were identified as 27 different enterovirus types. The most commonly detected were CV-B3 (10 isolates) and EV-B75 (5 isolates). Specifically, one, twenty-four and two of the enterovirus types identified in this study belong to EV-A, EV-B and EV-C respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the circulating strains of 27 non-polio enterovirus types in Nigerian children with AFP in 2014 and Nigerian strains of CV-B2, CV-B4, E17, EV-B80, EV-B73, EV-B97, EV-B93, EV-C99 and EV-A120 were reported for the first time. Furthermore, it shows that being positive for the 5'-UTR assay should not be the basis for subjecting isolates to the VP1 assays.",

Different mechanisms have been suggested involving the gut microbiota and intermediate metabolites such as lactate. Lactate can be metabolized by lactate-utilizing bacteria (LUB) to form different end-products. Using a functional approach, we hypothesized that H(2) production and accumulation by LUB is associated with the development of colic. The LUB communities in the feces of forty infants, including eight colicky infants, were characterized using a combination of culture- and molecular-based methods, and metabolite concentrations were measured by HPLC. Interactions among LUB strains isolated from feces were investigated with pure and mixed cultures using anaerobic techniques. We emphasized high prevalence of crying, flatulence, colic and positive correlations thereof in the first 3 months of life. Crying infants showed significantly higher ratio of LUB non-sulfate-reducing bacteria (LUB non-SRB) (H(2)-producer), to LUB SRB (H(2)-utilizer) at 3 months. Colicky infants had significantly higher number of H(2)-producing Eubacterium hallii at 2 weeks compared to non-colicky infants. We revealed the function of Desulfovibrio piger and Eubacterium limosum to reduce H(2) accumulation in co-cultures with H(2)-producing Veillonella ratti. Our data suggest that the balance between H(2)-producing and H(2)-utilizing LUB might contribute to colic symptoms.",

A total of 1639 rotavirus antigen-positive stool samples were obtained from children younger than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus G and P genotypes were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with consensus primers for the VP7 and VP4 genes, followed by semi-nested type-specific multiplex PCR. Rotavirus RNA was detected in 1396 (85.3%) of the samples tested. The highest detection rate (38.2%) was obtained among children in the 0-12 months age group, followed by children in the 13-24 months age group (36.2%). The most prevalent genotype was G1P[8] (24.6%) followed by G3P[8] (19.6%), G9P[8] (12.2%), G2P[4] (9.5%), G2P[8] (6.5%), and G4P[8] (4.8%). The proportions of uncommon and mixed genotypes were 21.5% and 1.14%, respectively. The large number of genotypes observed, including common, uncommon, and mixed types, indicates a high heterogeneity of RVA strains circulating in Turkey. The current study also exhibited dramatic fluctuations on the prevalences of the common genotypes, with increases in G3 and G1 and decreases in G9 and G2 from 2014-2016.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Since the present group had already described the composition of the intestinal microbiota of Brazilian infants under low social economic level, the aim of the present study was to analyze the microbial community structure changes in this group of infants during their early life due to external factors. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 11 infants monthly during the first year of life. The infants were followed regarding clinical and diet information and characterized according to breastfeeding practices. DNA was extracted from fecal samples of each child and subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction - Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. RESULTS: The results revealed a pattern of similarity between the time points for those who were on exclusive breastfeeding or predominant breastfeeding. Although there were changes in intensity and fluctuation of some bands, the Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis patterns in the one-year microbial analysis were stable for breastfeeding children. There was uninterrupted ecological succession despite the influence of external factors, such as complementary feeding and antibiotic administration, suggesting microbiota resilience. This was not observed for those children who had mixed feeding and introduction of solid food before the 5(th) month of life. CONCLUSION: These results suggested an intestinal microbiota pattern resilient to external forces, due to the probiotic and prebiotic effects of exclusive breastfeeding, reinforcing the importance of exclusive breastfeeding until the 6(th) month of life.",

We elucidated the prevalence, seasonality, type distribution and clinical presentation of HPeV among children in Hong Kong. METHODS: A 24-month prospective study to detect HPeV in children </=36 months hospitalized for acute viral illnesses. RESULTS: 2.3% of the 3911 children examined had HPeV infection, with most (87.5%) concentrated in September-January (autumn-winter). 81.3% were HPeV1 and 12.5% were HPeV4, while HPeV3 was rare (2.5%). HPeV was a probable cause of the disease in 47.7% (42/88), mostly self-limiting including acute gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection and maculopapular rash. A neonate developed severe sepsis-like illness with HPeV3 as the only pathogen detected. A high proportion (60.0%) of children coinfected with HPeV and other respiratory virus(es) had acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Six children with HPeV coinfections developed convulsion / pallid attack. Most rash illnesses exhibited a generalized maculopapular pattern involving the trunk and limbs, and were more likely associated with HPeV4 compared to other syndrome groups (36.4% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In Hong Kong, HPeV exhibits a clear seasonality (autumn-winter) and was found in a small proportion (2.3%) of young children (</=36 months) admitted with features of acute viral illnesses. The clinical presentation ranged from mild gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection and febrile rash to convulsion and severe sepsis-like illness. HPeV3, which is reported to associate with more severe disease in neonates, is rare in Hong Kong. HPeV coinfection might associate with convulsion and aggravate other respiratory tract infections.",

The impact of probiotic-supplemented infant formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well defined.Objective: We sought to determine the effects of a bifidobacteria-containing formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome during the first year of life.Design: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of newborn infants assigned to a standard whey-based formula containing a total of 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/g of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, B. longum subspecies infantis (intervention), or to a control formula without bifidobacteria (placebo). Breastfed controls were included. Diversity and composition of fecal microbiota were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, and metabolite profiles were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry over a period of 2 y.Results: Infants (n = 106) were randomly assigned to either the interventional (n = 48) or placebo (n = 49) group; 9 infants were exclusively breastfed throughout the entire intervention period of 12 mo. Infants exposed to bifidobacteria-supplemented formula showed decreased occurrence of Bacteroides and Blautia spp. associated with changes in lipids and unknown metabolites at month 1. Microbiota and metabolite profiles of intervention and placebo groups converged during the study period, and long-term colonization (24 mo) of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strains was not detected. Significant differences in microbiota and metabolites were detected between infants fed breast milk and those fed formula (P < 0.005) and between infants birthed vaginally and those birthed by cesarean delivery (P < 0.005). No significant differences were observed between infant feeding groups regarding growth, antibiotic uptake, or other health variables (P > 0.05).Conclusion: The supplementation of bifidobacteria to infant diet can modulate the occurrence of specific bacteria and metabolites during early life with no detectable long-term effects.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Development of the gut microbiota in infancy is important in maturation of the immune system. Deviations in colonization patterns have been associated with allergic manifestations such as eczema, but exact microbiome dysfunctions underlying allergies remain unclear. We studied the gut microbiota of 138 infants at increased risk of allergy, participating in a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of a partially hydrolyzed protein formula supplemented with nondigestible oligosaccharides on the prevention of eczema. OBJECTIVE: The effects of interventions and breast-feeding on fecal microbiota were investigated. Additionally, we aimed to identify microbial patterns associated with the onset of eczema. METHODS: Bacterial taxonomic compositions in the first 26 weeks of life were analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, fecal pH and microbial metabolite levels were measured. RESULTS: Fecal microbial composition, metabolites, and pH of infants receiving partially hydrolyzed protein formula supplemented with nondigestible oligosaccharides was closer to that of breast-fed infants than that of infants receiving standard cow's milk formula. Infants with eczema by 18 months showed discordant development of bacterial genera of Enterobacteriaceae and Parabacteroides species in the first 26 weeks, as well as decreased acquisition of lactate-utilizing bacteria producing butyrate, namely Eubacterium and Anaerostipes species, supported by increased lactate and decreased butyrate levels. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that a partially hydrolyzed protein infant formula with specific prebiotics modulated the gut microbiota closer to that of breast-fed infants. Additionally, we identified a potential link between microbial activity and onset of eczema, which might reflect a suboptimal implementation of gut microbiota at specific developmental stages in infants at high risk for allergy.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Observational studies in socioeconomically distinct populations have yielded conflicting conclusions about the strength of naturally acquired immunity against rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE), mirroring vaccine underperformance in low-income countries. We revisited birth cohort studies to understand naturally acquired protection against rotavirus infection and RVGE. METHODS: We reanalyzed data from 200 Mexican and 373 Indian children followed from birth to 2 and 3 years of age, respectively. We reassessed protection against RVGE, decomposing the incidence rate into the rate of rotavirus infection and the risk of RVGE given infection, and tested for serum antibody correlates of protection using regression models. RESULTS: Risk for primary, secondary, and subsequent infections to cause RVGE decreased per log-month of age by 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-41%), 69% (95% CI, 30%-86%), and 64% (95% CI, -186% to 95%), respectively, in Mexico City, and by 10% (95% CI, -1% to 19%), 51% (95% CI, 41%-59%) and 67% (95% CI, 57%-75%), respectively, in Vellore. Elevated serum immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G titers were associated with partial protection against rotavirus infection. Associations between older age and reduced risk for RVGE or moderate-to-severe RVGE given infection persisted after controlling for antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Dissimilar estimates of protection against RVGE may be due in part to age-related, antibody-independent risk for rotavirus infections to cause RVGE.",

			"abstract": "We hypothesized that giving the probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) DSM 17938 to preterm, formula-fed infants would prevent an early traumatic intestinal inflammatory insult modulating intestinal cytokine profile and reducing the onset of feeding intolerance. Newborn were randomly allocated during the first 48 h of life to receive either daily probiotic (10(8) colony forming units (CFUs) of L. reuteri DSM 17938) or placebo for one month. All the newborns underwent to gastric ultrasound for the measurement of gastric emptying time. Fecal samples were collected for the evaluation of fecal cytokines. Clinical data on feeding intolerance and weight gain were collected. The costs of hospital stays were calculated. The results showed that the newborns receiving L. reuteri DSM 17938 had a significant decrease in the number of days needed to reach full enteral feeding (p < 0.01), days of hospital stay (p < 0.01), and days of antibiotic treatment (p < 0.01). Statistically significant differences were observed in pattern of fecal cytokine profiles. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, was increased in newborns receiving L. reuteri DSM 17938. Pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-17, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels were increased in newborns given placebo. Differences in the gastric emptying and fasting antral area (FAA) were also observed. Our study demonstrates an effective role for L. reuteri DSM 17938 supplementation in preventing feeding intolerance and improving gut motor and immune function development in bottle-fed stable preterm newborns. Another benefit from the use of probiotics is the reducing cost for the Health Care service.",

Here, using a sensitive reverse transcription-qPCR approach, we demonstrate the carriage of eight signature infant-associated Bifidobacterium species (B. longum, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. catenulatum group, B. infantis, B. adolescentis, B. angulatum and B. dentium) in 76 healthy full-term vaginally-born infants from first day to three years of life. About 21% babies carry bifidobacteria at first day of life (6.2 +/- 1.9 log(10) cells/g feces); and this carriage increases to 64% (8.0 +/- 2.2), 79% (8.5 +/- 2.1), 97% (9.3 +/- 1.8), 99% (9.6 +/- 1.6), and 100% (9.7 +/- 0.9) at age 7 days, 1, 3 and 6 months, and 3 years, respectively. B. longum, B. breve, B. catenulatum group and B. bifidum are among the earliest and abundant bifidobacterial clades. Interestingly, infants starting formula-feed as early as first week of life have higher bifidobacterial carriage compared to exclusively breast-fed counterparts. Bifidobacteria demonstrate an antagonistic correlation with enterobacteria and enterococci. Further analyses also reveal a relatively lower/ delayed bifidobacterial carriage in cesarean-born babies. The study presents a quantitative perspective of the early-life gut Bifidobacterium colonization and shows how factors such as birth and feeding modes could influence this acquisition even in healthy infants.",

To establish the relationship between SAFVs and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and to clarify the longitudinal epidemiology of SAFVs, 7258 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from children with ARIs in Yamagata, Japan between 2008 and 2015. The specimens were inoculated on a microplate including six cell lines as part of routine surveillance, and molecular screening was performed for SAFVs using a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method. Throughout the study period, 95 (1.3%) SAFV genotype 2 (SAFV2), and 28 (0.4%) SAFV3 were detected, mainly between September and November. There were two outbreaks of SAFV2 in 2009 and 2013, and one outbreak of SAFV3 in 2012 and the positive rates during these outbreaks were 12.1% (53/439), 11% (35/319), and 4.4% (20/453), respectively. Sixty-three SAFV2 and 28 SAFV3 strains were detected as a single virus from children with ARIs such as pharyngitis, herpangina, and tonsillitis. These results suggested that SAFV2 and SAFV3 are possible causative agents of ARIs among children and their infections occur mainly in the autumn season in Japan.",

In contrast to the adult gut mycobiota, the establishment of the early gut mycobiota has never been described, and there is little knowledge about the fungal transfer from mother to offspring. METHODS: In a prospective cohort, we followed 298 pairs of healthy mothers and offspring from 36 weeks of gestation until 2 years of age (1516 samples) and explored the gut mycobiota in maternal and offspring samples. Half of the pregnant mothers were randomised into drinking probiotic milk during and after pregnancy. The probiotic bacteria included Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. We quantified the fungal abundance of all the samples using qPCR of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 segment, and we sequenced the 18S rRNA gene ITS1 region of 90 high-quantity samples using the MiSeq platform (Illumina). RESULTS: The gut mycobiota was detected in most of the mothers and the majority of the offspring. The offspring showed increased odds of having detectable faecal fungal DNA if the mother had detectable fungal DNA as well (OR = 1.54, p = 0.04). The fungal alpha diversity in the offspring gut increased from its lowest at 10 days after birth, which was the earliest sampling point. The fungal diversity and fungal species showed a succession towards the maternal mycobiota as the child aged, with Debaryomyces hansenii being the most abundant species during breast-feeding and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the most abundant after weaning. Probiotic consumption increased the gut mycobiota abundance in pregnant mothers (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study provides the first insight into the early fungal establishment and the succession of fungal species in the gut mycobiota. The results support the idea that the fungal host phenotype is transferred from mother to offspring. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00159523.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are at significant risk of developing bloodstream infections (BSIs). Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) both colonize and infect, but the association between these entities is unclear. By conducting a systematic literature review, we aimed to explore the impact of factors on the association between GN colonization and GN-BSI at both baby-level and unit-level. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Observational cohort studies published after 2000 up to June 2016 reporting data on the total number of neonates (0-28 days) colonized with GNB assessed by rectal/skin swab culture and the total number of neonates with GN-BSI (same bacteria) were included. Studies were excluded if data on skin/rectal colonization, neonates, and GNB could not be identified separately. Meta-analyses along with multivariate meta-regression with a random-effect model were performed to investigate factors associated with the GN colonization and GN-BSI at baby-level and unit-level. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria, 15 for the baby-level and 12 for the unit-level analysis. Study heterogeneity was high, with suboptimal overall quality of reporting assessed by the STROBE-NI statement (44.8% of items adequately reported). In 1984 colonized neonates, 157 (7.9%) developed GN-BSI compared with 85 of 3583 (2.4%) non-colonized neonates. Considerable heterogeneity was observed across studies. Four factors were included in the meta-regression model: gross domestic product (GDP), pathogen, outbreak, and frequency of screening. There was no statistically significant impact of these factors on GN colonization and GN-BSI in baby-level. We were unable to perform the multivariate meta-regression because of insufficient reported data for unit-level. CONCLUSIONS: Study limitations include the small number and the high heterogeneity of the included studies. While this report shows a correlation between colonization and BSI risk, these data currently do not support routine screening for GNB. Analysis of large cohorts of colonized neonates with clinical outcomes is still needed to define the major determinants leading from colonization to infection.",

We characterized the faecal microbiota of 4 breastfed infants and 4 formula-fed infants at 17 consecutive time points during the first 12 weeks of life. Microbiota composition was analysed by a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR). In this dataset, individuality was a major driver of microbiota composition (P = 0.002) and was more pronounced in breastfed infants. A developmental signature could be distinguished, characterized by sequential colonisation of i) intrauterine/vaginal birth associated taxa, ii) skin derived taxa and other typical early colonisers such as Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae, iii) domination of Bifidobacteriaceae, and iv) the appearance of adultlike taxa, particularly species associated with Blautia, Eggerthella, and the potential pathobiont Clostridium difficile. Low abundance of potential pathogens was detected by 16S profiling and confirmed by qPCR. Incidence and dominance of skin and breast milk associated microbes were increased in the gut microbiome of breastfed infants compared to formula-fed infants. The approaches in this study indicate that microbiota development of breastfed and formula-fed infants proceeds according to similar developmental stages with microbiota signatures that include stage-specific species.",

Prevalence of pathogenic bioserotype 3/O:3 varied geographically. In this population, the presence of fecal leukocytes was a characteristic of Y. enterocolitica infection and should be used as an indication for microbiological diagnostic testing, rather than for the diagnosis of bacillary dysentery. In contrast with Y. enterocolitica isolates from adults, which were primarily biotype 1A, isolates from children were primarily bioserotype 3/O:3. Most pathogenic isolates from children shared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns with isolates from pigs and dogs, suggesting a possible link between isolates from animals and infections in children.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 30-40% of children <1 year of age are Clostridium difficile colonized, and may represent a reservoir for adult C. difficile infections (CDI). Risk factors for colonization with toxigenic versus non-toxigenic C. difficile strains and longitudinal acquisition dynamics in infants remain incompletely characterized. METHODS: Predominantly healthy infants (</=2 years) were recruited in Oxfordshire, UK, and provided >/=1 fecal samples. Independent risk factors for toxigenic/non-toxigenic C. difficile colonization and acquisition were identified using multivariable regression. Infant C. difficile isolates were whole-genome sequenced to assay genetic diversity and prevalence of toxin-associated genes, and compared with sequenced strains from Oxfordshire CDI cases. RESULTS: 338/365 enrolled infants provided 1332 fecal samples, representing 158 C. difficile colonization or carriage episodes (107[68%] toxigenic). Initial colonization was associated with age, and reduced with breastfeeding but increased with pet dogs. Acquisition was associated with older age, Caesarean delivery, and diarrhea. Breastfeeding and pre-existing C. difficile colonization reduced acquisition risk. Overall 13% of CDI C. difficile strains were genetically related to infant strains. 29(18%) infant C. difficile sequences were consistent with recent direct/indirect transmission to/from Oxfordshire CDI cases (</=2 single nucleotide variants [SNVs]); 79(50%) shared a common origin with an Oxfordshire CDI case within the last ~5 years (0-10 SNVs). The hypervirulent, epidemic ST1/ribotype 027 remained notably absent in infants in this large study, as did other lineages such as STs 10/44 (ribotype 015); the most common strain in infants was ST2 (ribotype 020/014)(22%). CONCLUSIONS: In predominantly healthy infants without significant healthcare exposure C. difficile colonization and acquisition reflect environmental exposures, with pet dogs identified as a novel risk factor. Genetic overlap between some infant strains and those isolated from CDI cases suggest common community reservoirs of these C. difficile lineages, contrasting with those lineages found only in CDI cases, and therefore more consistent with healthcare-associated spread.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) was discovered in 2012, but its prevalence and clinical characteristics are largely unknown. METHODS: We used real-time TaqMan-based PCR to detect MWPyV in the feces (n = 174) of children with diarrhea, nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 887) from children with respiratory infections, and sera (n = 200) from healthy adults, and analyzed its clinical characteristics statistically. All the MWPyV-positive specimens were also screened for other common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Sixteen specimens were positive for MWPyV, including 13 (1.47%) respiratory samples and three (1.7%) fecal samples. The samples were all co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly with influenza viruses (69.2%) and human coronaviruses (30.7%). The MWPyV-positive children were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia or viral diarrhea. They ranged in age from 12 days to 9 years, and the most frequent symptoms were cough and fever. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR is an effective tool for the detection of MWPyV in different types of samples. MWPyV infection mainly occurs in young children, and fecal-oral transmission is a possible route of its transmission.",

			"abstract": "The gut microbiome is highly variable among individuals, largely due to differences in host lifestyle and physiology. However, little is known about the underlying processes or rules that shape the complex microbial community. In this paper, we show that the cumulative relative abundance distribution (CRAD) of microbial species can be approximated by a power law function, and found that the power exponent of CRADs generated from 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic data for normal gut microbiomes of humans and mice was similar consistently with  approximately 0.9. A similarly robust power exponent was observed in CRADs of gut microbiomes during dietary interventions and several diseases. However, the power exponent was found to be  approximately 0.6 in CRADs from gut microbiomes characterized by lower species richness, such as those of human infants and the small intestine of mice. In addition, the CRAD of gut microbiomes of mice treated with antibiotics differed slightly from those of infants and the small intestines of mice. Based on these observations, in addition to data on the spatial distribution of microbes in the digestive tract, we developed a 3-dimensional mathematical model of microbial proliferation that reproduced the experimentally observed CRAD patterns. Our model indicated that the CRAD may be determined by the ratio of emerging to pre-existing species during non-uniform spatially competitive proliferation, independent of species composition.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Disturbances in the early establishment of the intestinal microbiota may produce important implications for the infant's health and for the risk of disease later on. Different perinatal conditions may be affecting the development of the gut microbiota. Some of them, such as delivery mode or feeding habits, have been extensively assessed whereas others remain to be studied, being critical to identify their impact on the microbiota and, if any, to minimize it. Antibiotics are among the drugs most frequently used in early life, the use of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis (IAP), present in over 30% of deliveries, being the most frequent source of exposure. However, our knowledge on the effects of IAP on the microbiota establishment is still limited. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the impact of IAP investigating a cohort of 40 full-term vaginally delivered infants born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, 18 of which were born from mothers receiving IAP. RESULTS: Fecal samples were collected at 2, 10, 30, and 90 days of age. We analyzed the composition of the fecal microbiota during the first 3 months of life by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantified fecal short chain fatty acids by gas chromatography. The presence of genes for resistance to antibiotics was determined by PCR in the samples from 1-month-old infants. Our results showed an altered pattern of intestinal microbiota establishment in IAP infants during the first weeks of life, with lower relative proportions of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes and increased of Preoteobacteria and Firmicutes. A delay in the increase on the levels of acetate was observed in IAP infants. The analyses of specific antibiotic resistance genes showed a higher occurrence of some beta-lactamase coding genes in infants whose mothers received IAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an effect of IAP on the establishing early microbiota during the first months of life, which represent a key moment for the development of the microbiota-induced host homeostasis. Understanding the impact of IAP in the gut microbiota development is essential for developing treatments to minimize it, favoring a proper gut microbiota development in IAP-exposed neonates.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrheal disease remains among the leading causes of global mortality in children younger than 5 years. Exposure to domestic animals may be a risk factor for diarrheal disease. The objectives of this study were to identify animal-related exposures associated with cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children in rural western Kenya, and to identify the major zoonotic enteric pathogens present in domestic animals residing in the homesteads of case and control children. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We characterized animal-related exposures in a subset of case and control children (n = 73 pairs matched on age, sex and location) with reported animal presence at home enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study in western Kenya, and analysed these for an association with MSD. We identified potentially zoonotic enteric pathogens in pooled fecal specimens collected from domestic animals resident at children's homesteads. Variables that were associated with decreased risk of MSD were washing hands after animal contact (matched odds ratio [MOR] = 0.2; 95% CI 0.08-0.7), and presence of adult sheep that were not confined in a pen overnight (MOR = 0.1; 0.02-0.5). Variables that were associated with increased risk of MSD were increasing number of sheep owned (MOR = 1.2; 1.0-1.5), frequent observation of fresh rodent excreta (feces/urine) outside the house (MOR = 7.5; 1.5-37.2), and participation of the child in providing water to chickens (MOR = 3.8; 1.2-12.2). Of 691 pooled specimens collected from 2,174 domestic animals, 159 pools (23%) tested positive for one or more potentially zoonotic enteric pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, non-typhoidal Salmonella, diarrheagenic E. coli, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, or rotavirus). We did not find any association between the presence of particular pathogens in household animals, and MSD in children. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Public health agencies should continue to promote frequent hand washing, including after animal contact, to reduce the risk of MSD. Future studies should address specific causal relations of MSD with sheep and chicken husbandry practices, and with the presence of rodents.",

However, data supporting the role of NoV in diarrheal disease are limited in the African continent. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the distribution of NoV genotypes circulating in outpatient children from rural communities of Vhembe district/South Africa. STUDY DESIGN: Stool specimens were collected from children under five years of age with diarrhea, and controls without diarrhea, between July 2014 and April 2015. NoV-positive samples, detected previously by Realtime PCR, were analysed using conventional RT-PCR targeting the partial capsid and polymerase genes. Nucleotide sequencing methods were performed to genotype the strains. RESULTS: The sequence analyses demonstrated multiple NoV genotypes including GI.4 (13.8%), GI.5 (6.9%), GII.14 (6.9%), GII.4 (31%), GII.6 (3.4%), GII.P15 (3.4%), GII.P21 (3.4%) and GII.Pe (31%). The most prevalent NoV genotypes were GII.4 Sydney 2012 variants (n=7) among the capsid genotypes, GII.Pe (n=9) among the polymerase genotypes and GII.Pe/GII.4 Sydney 2012 (n=8) putative recombinants among the RdRp/Capsid genotypes. Two unassigned GII.4 variants were found. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlighted NoV genetic diversity and revealed continuous pandemic spread and predominance of GII.Pe/GII.4 Sydney 2012, indicative of increased NoV activity. An unusual RdRp genotype GII.P15 and two unassigned GII.4 variants were also identified from rural settings of the Vhembe district/South Africa. NoV surveillance is warranted to help to inform investigations into NoV evolution and disease burden, and to support on-going vaccine development programmes.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astrovirus (HAstV) is a common viral pathogen that causes gastroenteritis worldwide. It is classified into eight classical human types (HAstV-1/8) and seven other less prevalent types, described as HAstV VA1, VA2, VA3, VA4, MLB-1, MLB-2 and MLB-3. During outbreaks, the elderly and children are the most affected, and the spread of the virus is associated with person-to-person contact, food ingestion and contaminated water. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of infection and genetic diversity of HAstV strains. Samples were collected from children with acute gastroenteritis admitted to a large pediatric hospital during a surveillance period of three years (2008-2011) in Belem city, Para State, Amazon Region, Northern Brazil. STUDY DESIGN: Screening and genotyping tests were conducted using RT-PCR to detect the classical and non-classical HAstV types using specific primers. A semi-nested RT-PCR protocol was developed to improve viral detection in samples with a low viral load. RESULTS: The overall positivity observed in this study was 3.9% (19/483). The age distribution showed a high prevalence of positive cases in children under one year old (5.3%). We found vomiting associated with 75% of the positive cases, fever with 82.3%, and dehydration with 76.9%. Most patients with positive cases demonstrated two to five days of diarrhea, two to three episodes of vomiting during hospitalization, and three bowel movements per day. Co-infection with HAstV and norovirus was observed in three cases (15.8%), and no pattern of seasonality or any relationship between the HAstV positivity rate and climate variables was observed. Eighteen positive samples (94.7%-18/19) were genotyped based on the ORF 2 region, and the greatest prevalence was of HAstV-1a (66.6%-12/18), followed by HAstV-2 (22.2%-4/18, comprising two type-2b and two type-2c genotypes), HAstV-3c (5.6%-1/18) and HAstV-4c (5.6%-1/18). No non-classical types were detected in the clinical samples analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that although HAstV infections occur at low frequency, they are involved in severe pediatric cases of acute gastroenteritis presenting with a high diversity of strains, including the lineages 3c and 4c, which were never before detected in Brazil.",

			"abstract": "Child feces represent a particular health risk to children due to increased prevalence of enteric agents and a higher risk of exposure owing to exploratory behaviors of young children. The safe management of such feces presents a significant challenge, not only for the 2.4 billion who lack access to improved sanitation, but also due to unhygienic feces collection and disposal and poor subsequent handwashing practices. We assessed potential sources of fecal exposure by documenting child feces management practices in a cross-sectional study of 851 children < 5 years of age from 694 households in 42 slums in two cities in Odisha, India. No preambulatory children and only 27.4% of ambulatory children defecated directly in the latrine. Children that did not defecate in a latrine mainly defecated on the ground, whether they were preambulatory or ambulatory. Use of diapers (1.2%) or potties (2.8%) was low. If the feces were removed from the ground, the defecation area was usually cleaned, if at all, only with water. Most children's feces were disposed of in surrounding environment, with only 6.5% deposited into any kind of latrine, including unimproved. Handwashing with soap of the caregiver after child feces disposal and child anal cleaning with soap after defecation was also uncommon. While proper disposal of child feces in an improved latrine still represents a major challenge, control of the risks presented requires attention to the full range of exposures associated to the management of child feces, and not simply the place of disposal.",

We examined the risk factors for EAEC infections and their associations with environmental enteropathy biomarkers and growth outcomes over the first two years of life in eight low-resource settings of the MAL-ED study. METHODS: EAEC infections were detected by PCR gene probes for aatA and aaiC virulence traits in 27,094 non-diarrheal surveillance stools and 7,692 diarrheal stools from 2,092 children in the MAL-ED birth cohort. We identified risk factors for EAEC and estimated the associations of EAEC with diarrhea, enteropathy biomarker concentrations, and both short-term (one to three months) and long-term (to two years of age) growth. RESULTS: Overall, 9,581 samples (27.5%) were positive for EAEC, and almost all children had at least one detection (94.8%) by two years of age. Exclusive breastfeeding, higher enrollment weight, and macrolide use within the preceding 15 days were protective. Although not associated with diarrhea, EAEC infections were weakly associated with biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and more strongly with reduced length at two years of age (LAZ difference associated with high frequency of EAEC detections: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic EAEC infections were common early in life and were associated with linear growth shortfalls. Associations with intestinal inflammation were small in magnitude, but suggest a pathway for the growth impact. Increasing the duration of exclusive breastfeeding may help prevent these potentially inflammatory infections and reduce the long-term impact of early exposure to EAEC.",

In this work, we studied the antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants of 26 E. faecalis and 15 E. faecium intestinal isolates from Spanish healthy breastfed infants. Overall, commensal enterococci studied contained antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, although their patterns were not according to those described for antibiotic-resistant hospital-associated enterococci. None of the isolates was resistant to vancomycin, although the majority showed resistance to some antibiotics. E. faecalis isolates harbored considerably more virulence determinants than E. faecium isolates, but some genes linked to colonization were abundant in both species. Hemolysin activity was not detected in any of the isolates; and the gelatinase gene, when present, was silent in E. faecium, whereas gelatinase activity occurred in half of the E. faecalis isolates studied.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Late onset sepsis (LOS) in preterm infants is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. While studies have implicated gut bacteria in the aetiology of the disease, functional analysis and mechanistic insights are generally lacking. We performed temporal bacterial (n = 613) and metabolomic (n = 63) profiling on extensively sampled stool from 7 infants with LOS and 28 matched healthy (no LOS or NEC) controls. RESULTS: The bacteria isolated in diagnostic blood culture usually corresponded to the dominant bacterial genera in the gut microbiome. Longitudinal changes were monitored based on preterm gut community types (PGCTs), where control infants had an increased number of PGCTs compared to LOS infants (P = 0.011). PGCT 6, characterised by Bifidobacteria dominance, was only present in control infants. Metabolite profiles differed between LOS and control infants at diagnosis and 7 days later, but not 7 days prior to diagnosis. Bifidobacteria was positively correlated with control metabolites, including raffinose, sucrose, and acetic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Using multi-omic analysis, we show that the gut microbiome is involved in the pathogenesis of LOS. While the causative agent of LOS varies, it is usually abundant in the gut. Bifidobacteria dominance was associated with control infants, and the presence of this organism may directly protect, or act as a marker for protection, against gut epithelial translocation. While the metabolomic data is preliminary, the findings support that gut development and protection in preterm infants is associated with increased in prebiotic oligosaccharides (e.g. raffinose) and the growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g. Bifidobacterium).",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Establishment of the human gut microbiota begins at birth. This early-life microbiota development can impact host physiology during infancy and even across an entire life span. However, the functional stability and population structure of the gut microbiota during initial colonization remain poorly understood. Metaproteomics is an emerging technology for the large-scale characterization of metabolic functions in complex microbial communities (gut microbiota). RESULTS: We applied a metagenome-informed metaproteomic approach to study the temporal and inter-individual differences of metabolic functions during microbial colonization of preterm human infants' gut. By analyzing 30 individual fecal samples, we identified up to 12,568 protein groups for each of four infants, including both human and microbial proteins. With genome-resolved matched metagenomics, proteins were confidently identified at the species/strain level. The maximum percentage of the proteome detected for the abundant organisms was ~45%. A time-dependent increase in the relative abundance of microbial versus human proteins suggested increasing microbial colonization during the first few weeks of early life. We observed remarkable variations and temporal shifts in the relative protein abundances of each organism in these preterm gut communities. Given the dissimilarity of the communities, only 81 microbial EggNOG orthologous groups and 57 human proteins were observed across all samples. These conserved microbial proteins were involved in carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism while conserved human proteins were related to immune response and mucosal maturation. We identified seven proteome clusters for the communities and showed infant gut proteome profiles were unstable across time and not individual-specific. Applying a gut-specific metabolic module (GMM) analysis, we found that gut communities varied primarily in the contribution of nutrient (carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids) utilization and short-chain fatty acid production. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study reports species-specific proteome profiles and metabolic functions of human gut microbiota during early colonization. In particular, our work contributes to reveal microbiota-associated shifts and variations in the metabolism of three major nutrient sources and short-chain fatty acid during colonization of preterm infant gut.",

			"article_name": "Metaproteomics reveals functional differences in intestinal microbiota development of preterm infants.",
			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Development of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system can be modulated by the gut microbiota. Establishment of the intestinal microbiota, in its turn, is affected by host and environmental factors. As such, development of the gut microbiota is greatly impacted in preterm infants, who have an immature gut and are exposed to factors like hospitalization, caesarean section, antibiotics, and respiratory support. DESIGN: We analyzed fecal microbiota composition and activity of ten preterm infants (gestational age 25-30 weeks; birthweight 630-1750 g) during the first six postnatal weeks through metaproteomics (LC-MS/MS) and 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: A gestational-age-dependent microbial signature is observed, enabling microbiota-based differentiation between extremely preterm (25-27 weeks gestation) and very preterm (30 weeks gestation) infants. In very preterm infants, the intestinal microbiota developed toward a Bifidobacterium-dominated community and was associated with high abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Extremely preterm infants remained predominantly colonized by facultative anaerobes and were associated with proteins involved in membrane transport and translation. Delayed colonization by obligate anaerobes could be associated with antibiotic treatment and respiratory support. CONCLUSION: We speculate that gestational age and its associated intensity of care (e.g. antibiotics and respiratory support) affects intestinal microbiota composition and activity in preterm infants. As the gut microbiota plays a major role in development of the neonate, gestational age and its associated factors could set the stage for early and later life health complications via interference with microbiota development.",

			"article_name": "Antibiotics for neonates born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 10 pregnancies is affected by meconium passage at delivery, which can result in meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). MAS can cause respiratory complications and, very rarely, death. Antibiotics have been prescribed for neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid, with the intention of preventing infection due to potential bacterial contaminants. OBJECTIVES: We conducted this review to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for:1. prevention of infection, morbidity, and mortality among infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) who are asymptomatic at birth; and2. prevention of infection, morbidity, and mortality among infants born through MSAF who have signs and symptoms compatible with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). SEARCH METHODS: We performed a literature search using the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016); Embase (1980 to July 2016); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to July 2016); and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7) in the Cochrane Library. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared antibiotics administered via any route versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of infection among neonates exposed to MSAF, or who developed MAS. We excluded cohort, case control, and any other non-randomised studies and applied no language restrictions. We included studies of term and preterm infants, and we included studies examining use of any antibacterial antibiotics. We included studies that reported on any outcomes of interest. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed the methodological quality of included trials by reviewing information provided in study reports and obtained by personal communication with study authors. We extracted data on relevant outcomes, estimated effect size, and reported values as risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and mean differences (MDs), as appropriate. We conducted subgroup analyses for treatment of MAS and for prophylaxis (asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium). MAIN RESULTS: Four randomised controlled studies including a total of 695 participants were eligible for inclusion. Three studies evaluated neonates with MAS, and one study assessed asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid. These studies exhibited varying degrees of methodological rigour: Two studies were at low risk of bias, and two were at unclear risk. We graded evidence derived from these studies as low quality. We downgraded overall evidence owing to the large number of participants lost to follow-up in one trial, the small sample sizes of all trials, and unclear methodological details provided for two trials.The primary outcome was risk of early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis. Antibiotics did not decrease the risk of sepsis in neonates with a diagnosis of MAS (RR 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 8.96; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; 445 participants, three studies; I(2) = 0%) nor in asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.34; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04; 250 participants, one study; I(2) = 0%). Results show no significant differences in mortality or duration of stay in hospital between groups given antibiotics and control groups of symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates. One study in asymptomatic neonates reported a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation for the control group compared with the antibiotic group (MD 0.26, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.37; 250 participants, one study; I(2) = 0%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Upon review of available evidence, we found no differences in infection rates following antibiotic treatment among neonates born through meconium-stained fluid and those with meconium aspiration syndrome. The overall quality of evidence is low owing to the small number of included studies. Well-controlled studies of adequate power are needed.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study examined associations between household sanitation and enteric infection - including diarrhoeal-specific outcomes - in children 0-2 years of age in a low-income, dense urban neighbourhood. METHODS: As part of the MAL-ED study, 230 children in a low-income, urban, Indian neighbourhood provided stool specimens at 14-17 scheduled time points and during diarrhoeal episodes in the first 2 years of life that were analysed for bacterial, parasitic (protozoa and helminths) and viral pathogens. From interviews with caregivers in 100 households, the relationship between the presence (and discharge) of household sanitation facilities and any, pathogen-specific, and diarrhoea-specific enteric infection was tested through mixed-effects Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Few study households (33%) reported having toilets, most of which (82%) discharged into open drains. Controlling for season and household socio-economic status, the presence of a household toilet was associated with lower risks of enteric infection (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.79-1.06), bacterial infection (RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75-1.02) and protozoal infection (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.39-1.04), although not statistically significant, but had no association with diarrhoea (RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.68-1.45) or viral infections (RR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.79-1.60). Models also suggested that the relationship between household toilets discharging to drains and enteric infection risk may vary by season. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a household toilet was associated with lower risk of bacterial and protozoal enteric infections, but not diarrhoea or viral infections, suggesting the health effects of sanitation may be more accurately estimated using outcome measures that account for aetiologic agents.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The correct establishment of the human gut microbiota represents a crucial development that commences at birth. Different hypotheses propose that the infant gut microbiota is derived from, among other sources, the mother's fecal/vaginal microbiota and human milk. RESULTS: The composition of bifidobacterial communities of 25 mother-infant pairs was investigated based on an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) approach, combined with cultivation-mediated and genomic analyses. We identified bifidobacterial strains/communities that are shared between mothers and their corresponding newborns. Notably, genomic analyses together with growth profiling assays revealed that bifidobacterial strains that had been isolated from human milk are genetically adapted to utilize human milk glycans. In addition, we identified particular bacteriophages specific of bifidobacterial species that are common in the viromes of mother and corresponding child. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the transmission of bifidobacterial communities from the mother to her child and implies human milk as a potential vehicle to facilitate this acquisition. Furthermore, these data represent the first example of maternal inheritance of bifidobacterial phages, also known as bifidophages in infants following a vertical transmission route.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ascariasis, trichuriasis and hymenolepiasis occur primarily within poor communities with low hygiene standards. This study examined the occurrence of intestinal helminth infections among children living in two counties (Kosice and Presov) in the Eastern Slovak Republic. STUDY DESIGN: Four hundred and twenty-six children were divided into groups according to ethnicity (non-Roma and Roma), age, sex, urban/rural residency and county of residence. METHODS: Stool samples collected from participants were processed by formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation and examined microscopically. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of infection was 16.90% and the most prevalent species was Ascaris lumbricoides (14.32%). This was followed by Trichuris trichiura (3.76%), Hymenolepis nana (0.94%) and Hymenolepis diminuta (0.23%). The odds ratio for infection was 52 times higher among Roma children compared with non-Roma children. Among Roma children, the lowest prevalence of infection was reported in adolescents aged >/=16 years. No significant differences in the prevalence of helminths were found between different sexes, or between hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants. Roma children living in urban areas had a 3.36 higher probability of infection than those living in rural areas. Among Roma children, helminth ova were found in 31.76% of the specimens from Kosice County and 19.69% of the specimens from Presov County. Among non-Roma children, there was only one positive finding in Presov County, and no cases in Kosice County. CONCLUSIONS: Important risk factors associated with helminth infections are ethnicity, county of residence and urban/rural residency. Ascariasis, trichuriasis and hymenolepiasis still occur in children with low hygiene standards, and this needs to be addressed by local authorities.",

			"article_name": "Reducing Viability Bias in Analysis of Gut Microbiota in Preterm Infants at Risk of NEC and Sepsis.",
			"abstract": "Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis are serious diseases of preterm infants that can result in feeding intolerance, the need for bowel resection, impaired physiological and neurological development, and high mortality rates. Neonatal healthcare improvements have allowed greater survival rates in preterm infants leading to increased numbers at risk of developing NEC and sepsis. Gut bacteria play a role in protection from or propensity to these conditions and have therefore, been studied extensively using targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. However, exact epidemiology of these conditions remain unknown and the role of the gut microbiota in NEC remains enigmatic. Many studies have confounding variables such as differing clinical intervention strategies or major methodological issues such as the inability of 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods to determine viable from non-viable taxa. Identification of viable community members is important to identify links between the microbiota and disease in the highly unstable preterm infant gut. This is especially important as remnant DNA is robust and persists in the sampling environment following cell death. Chelation of such DNA prevents downstream amplification and inclusion in microbiota characterisation. This study validates use of propidium monoazide (PMA), a DNA chelating agent that is excluded by an undamaged bacterial membrane, to reduce bias associated with 16S rRNA gene analysis of clinical stool samples. We aim to improve identification of the viable microbiota in order to increase the accuracy of clinical inferences made regarding the impact of the preterm gut microbiota on health and disease. Gut microbiota analysis was completed on stools from matched twins (n = 16) that received probiotics. Samples were treated with PMA, prior to bacterial DNA extraction. Meta-analysis highlighted a significant reduction in bacterial diversity in 68.8% of PMA treated samples as well as significantly reduced overall rare taxa abundance. Importantly, overall abundances of genera associated with protection from and propensity to NEC and sepsis such as: Bifidobacterium; Clostridium, and Staphylococcus sp. were significantly different following PMA-treatment. These results suggest non-viable cell exclusion by PMA-treatment reduces bias in gut microbiota analysis from which clinical inferences regarding patient susceptibility to NEC and sepsis are made.",

			"article_name": "Genetic Virulence Profile of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Strains Isolated from Danish Children with Either Acute or Persistent Diarrhea.",
			"abstract": "Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is frequently found in diarrheal stools worldwide. It has been associated with persistent diarrhea, weight loss, and failure to thrive in children living in developing countries. A number of important EAEC virulence genes are identified; however, their roles in acute and persistent diarrhea have not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to identify specific EAEC virulence genes associated with duration and type of diarrhea in Danish children. We aimed to improve the current diagnostics of EAEC and enable targeting of strains with an expected severe disease course. Questionnaires answered by parents provided information regarding duration of diarrhea and presence of blood or mucus. A total of 295 EAEC strains were collected from children with acute (</=7 days) and persistent diarrhea (>/=14 days) and were compared by using multiplex PCR targeting the genes sat, sepA, pic, sigA, pet, astA, aatA, aggR, aaiC, aap, agg3/4C, ORF3, aafA, aggA, agg3A, agg4A, and agg5A. Furthermore, the distribution of EAEC genes in strains collected from cases of bloody, mucoid, and watery diarrhea was investigated. The classification and regression tree analysis (CART) was applied to investigate the relationship between EAEC virulence genes and diarrheal duration and type. Persistent diarrhea was associated with strains lacking the pic gene (p = 0.002) and with the combination of the genes pic, sat, and absence of the aggA gene (p = 0.05). Prolonged diarrhea was associated with the combination of the genes aatA and astA (p = 0.03). Non-mucoid diarrhea was associated with strains lacking the aatA gene (p = 0.004). Acute diarrhea was associated with the genes aggR, aap, and aggA by individual odds ratios. Resistance toward gentamicin and ciprofloxacin was observed in 7.5 and 3% of strains, respectively. Multi-drug resistance was observed in 38% of strains. Genetic host factors have been associated with an increased risk of EAEC-associated disease. Therefore, we investigated a panel of risk factors in two groups of children-EAEC-positive and EAEC-negative-to identify additional factors predisposing to disease. The duration of breastfeeding was positively correlated with the likelihood of belonging to the EAEC-negative group of children.",

Studies involving the detection and molecular characterisation of NoV have been performed in Brazil, demonstrating its importance as an etiological agent of AGE. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency of human NoV and to genotype the strains isolated from 0-14-year-old patients of AGE in Manaus, Brazil, over a period of two years. METHODS: A total of 426 faecal samples were collected between January 2010 and December 2011. All samples were tested for the presence of NoV antigens using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit. RNA was extracted from all faecal suspensions and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the NoV-polymerase partial region was performed as a trial test. Positive samples were then subjected to PCR with specific primers for partial capsid genes, which were then sequenced. FINDINGS: NoV was detected in 150 (35.2%) faecal samples, for at least one of the two techniques used. NoV was detected in children from all age groups, with the highest positivity observed among the group of 1-2 years old. Clinically, fever was verified in 43% of the positive cases and 46.3% of the negative cases, and vomiting was observed in 75.8% and 70.8% cases in these groups, respectively. Monthly distribution showed that the highest positivity was observed in January 2010 (81.2%), followed by February and April 2010 and March 2011, when the positivity rate reached almost 50%. Phylogenetic analyses performed with 65 positive strains demonstrated that 58 (89.2%) cases of NoV belonged to genotype GII.4, five (7.7%) to GII.6, and one (1.5%) each to GII.7 and GII.3.

			"abstract": "Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the most prevalent pathogens causing late-onset sepsis in neonates. The question is whether neonates acquire endemic hospital-adapted clones or incidentally occurring CoNS strains after birth during their hospital stay. Therefore, a prospective study was performed on the prevalence of CoNS in the stool of babies (born vaginally or by cesarean section) during their first days of life. Their clonal relatedness and potential to induce invasive disease were characterized. CoNS were analyzed from the stool samples of newborns with a load of CoNS above 10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The identification of CoNS was performed phenotypically and genotypically. For typing, repetitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and multilocus sequence typing were used. Resistance profiles, biofilm production, the presence of icaAD and of IS256 were determined as well. From a total of 207 stool samples (56 newborns), CoNS were detected in 41% of the newborns, mostly on day 3 for the first time (62.5%). Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 85.7% of cases, harbored no IS256 element, and mostly expressed no biofilm. The isolates were separated into four main clusters by repetitive sequence-based PCR. 24% of the strains showed no antimicrobial resistance. 20% were resistant against four antibiotics of two different antibiotic classes. The remaining strains were resistant only against one antimicrobial substance class. Thus, it can be concluded that newborns do not acquire hospital-adapted endemic, multidrug-resistant S. epidermidis isolates during their first days of life. Yet, the results support the thesis that, during hospital stay, environmental parameters may convert sensible/noninvasive S. epidermidis strains into multidrug-resistant strains with characteristics of invasiveness.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Group C Rotavirus (RVC) is an enteric pathogen responsible for acute gastroenteritis in children and adults globally. At present there are no surveillance studies on group C Rotaviruses in India and therefore their prevalence in India remains unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate group C rotavirus infection among <5 years old children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in New Delhi. METHODS: A total of 350 fecal specimens were collected during September 2013 to November 2014 from <5 years old diarrheal patients admitted at KSCH hospital, Delhi. The samples found negative for group A rotavirus (N = 180) by Enzyme immunoassay were screened for group C rotavirus by RT-PCR with VP6, VP7 and VP4 gene specific primers. The PCR products were further sequenced (VP6, VP7, VP4) and analyzed to ascertain their origin and G and P genotypes. RESULTS: Six out of 180 (group A rotavirus negative) samples were found positive for group C rotavirus by VP6 gene specific RT-PCR, of which 3 were also found positive for VP7 and VP4 genes. Phylogenetic analysis of VP7 and VP4 genes of these showed them to be G4 and P[2] genotypes. Overall, the nucleotide sequence data (VP6, VP7 and VP4) revealed a close relationship with the human group C rotavirus with no evidence of animal ancestry. Interestingly, the nucleotide sequence analysis of various genes also indicated differences in their origin. While the identity matrix of VP4 gene (n = 3) showed high amino acid sequence identity (97.60 to 98.20%) with Korean strain, the VP6 gene (n = 6) showed maximum identity with Nigerian strain (96.40 to 97.60%) and VP7 gene (n = 3) with Bangladeshi and USA strains. This is true for all analyzed samples. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the group C rotavirus as the cause of severe diarrhea in young children in Delhi and provides insights on the origin of group C rotavirus genes among the local strains indicating their source of transmission. Our study also highlights the need for a simple and reliable diagnostic test that can be utilized to determine the disease burden due to group C rotavirus in India.",

Faecal samples from 89 healthy term infants were collected at age 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 3 years. C. perfringens was quantified by qPCR; other gut bacteria were quantified by reverse-transcription-qPCR. Alpha-toxigenic C. perfringens was detected in 3.4% infants at day 7 but was present in 35-40% infants at subsequent time-points, with counts ranging from 10(3)-10(7) cells/g faeces. Enterotoxigenic C. perfringens remained undetected at day 7 but was detected in 1.1, 4.5, 10.1 and 4.5% infants at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 3 years, respectively. Intriguingly, infants carrying alpha-toxigenic C. perfringens had lower levels of Bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and organic acids as compared to non-carriers. Further analyses revealed that, compared to vaginally-born infants, caesarean-born infants had higher carriage of C. perfringens and lower levels of B. fragilis group, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and faecal organic acids during first 6 months. Compared to formula-fed infants, breast-fed infants were slightly less often colonised with C. perfringens; and within caesarean-born infants, breast-fed infants had slightly lower levels of C. perfringens and higher levels of B. fragilis group, bifidobacteria, and lactobacilli than formula-fed infants. This study demonstrates the quantitative dynamics of toxigenic C. perfringens colonisation in infants during the early years of life. Caesarean-born infants acquire a somewhat perturbed microbiota, and breast-feeding might be helpful in ameliorating this dysbiosis. Higher carriage of toxigenic C. perfringens in healthy infants is intriguing and warrants further investigation of its sources and clinical significance in infants, particularly the caesarean-born who may represent a potential reservoir of this opportunistic pathogen and might be more prone to associated illnesses.",

			"abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Establishment of the infant microbiome has lifelong implications on health and immunity. Gut microbiota of breastfed compared with nonbreastfed individuals differ during infancy as well as into adulthood. Breast milk contains a diverse population of bacteria, but little is known about the vertical transfer of bacteria from mother to infant by breastfeeding. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the maternal breast milk and areolar skin and infant gut bacterial communities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a prospective, longitudinal study, bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in breast milk, areolar skin, and infant stool samples of 107 healthy mother-infant pairs. The study was conducted in Los Angeles, California, and St Petersburg, Florida, between January 1, 2010, and February 28, 2015. EXPOSURES: Amount and duration of daily breastfeeding and timing of solid food introduction. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Bacterial composition in maternal breast milk, areolar skin, and infant stool by sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. RESULTS: In the 107 healthy mother and infant pairs (median age at the time of specimen collection, 40 days; range, 1-331 days), 52 (43.0%) of the infants were male. Bacterial communities were distinct in milk, areolar skin, and stool, differing in both composition and diversity. The infant gut microbial communities were more closely related to an infant's mother's milk and skin compared with a random mother (mean difference in Bray-Curtis distances, 0.012 and 0.014, respectively; P < .001 for both). Source tracking analysis was used to estimate the contribution of the breast milk and areolar skin microbiomes to the infant gut microbiome. During the first 30 days of life, infants who breastfed to obtain 75% or more of their daily milk intake received a mean (SD) of 27.7% (15.2%) of the bacteria from breast milk and 10.3% (6.0%) from areolar skin. Bacterial diversity (Faith phylogenetic diversity, P = .003) and composition changes were associated with the proportion of daily breast milk intake in a dose-dependent manner, even after the introduction of solid foods. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study indicate that bacteria in mother's breast milk seed the infant gut, underscoring the importance of breastfeeding in the development of the infant gut microbiome.",

METHODS: Children were recruited by 17 days of age and followed to 24 months with collection of monthly surveillance and diarrheal stools. Data on sociodemographics, feeding, and illness were collected at defined intervals. Stools were tested for rotavirus and sera for antirotavirus immunoglobulins by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: A total of 1737 children contributed 22646 surveillance and 7440 diarrheal specimens. Overall, rotavirus was detected in 5.5% (408/7440) of diarrheal stools, and 344 (19.8%) children ever had rotavirus gastroenteritis. Household overcrowding and a high pathogen load were consistent risk factors for infection and disease. Three prior infections conferred 74% (P < .001) protection against subsequent infection in sites not using vaccine. In Peru, incidence of rotavirus disease was relatively higher during the second year of life despite high vaccination coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus infection and disease were common, but with significant heterogeneity by site. Protection by vaccination may not be sustained in the second year of life in settings with high burdens of transmission and poor response to oral vaccines.",

This study estimates the proportion of persistent giardiasis in 3 hospitals in Barcelona, describes associated risk factors and genotype, and evaluates the efficacy rate of quinacrine in those with persistent giardiasis. METHODS: A clinical, prospective, observational study was conducted in patients with giardiasis treated with nitroimidazoles. Those with persistent giardiasis were provided quinacrine. Molecular characterization of Giardia isolates was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a fragment of tpi and bg genes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were recruited and treated with nitroimidazoles, and in 14 of 71 (20%) of patients followed up, Giardia persisted. Refractory giardiasis was associated with malaise (P = .007) and anorexia (P = .02), with previous giardiasis (P = .03), and with previous antibiotic (P = .02) or antiparasitic(P = .04) use. Quinacrine had an effectiveness rate of 100% in refractory giardiasis (n = 13; 95% confidence interval = 75-100). Molecular characterization showed that 17 (25%) Giardia isolates belonged to assemblage A, and 31 (43%) belonged to assemblage B. In refractory giardiasis, assemblage A and B were found responsible in 4 and 6 cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 20% of patients presented persistent giardiasis, belonging to both assemblages A and B, after nitroimidazole. Short course of quinacrine was effective in treating refractory cases. Further controlled studies should evaluate its efficacy and safety.",

			"abstract": "Elucidating the adaptive strategies and plasticity of bacterial genomes in situ is crucial for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of pathogens threatening human health. While much is known about the evolution of Escherichia coli in controlled laboratory environments, less effort has been made to elucidate the genome dynamics of E. coli in its native settings. Here, we follow the genome dynamics of co-existing E. coli lineages in situ of the infant gut during the first year of life. One E. coli lineage causes a urinary tract infection (UTI) and experiences several alterations of its genomic content during subsequent antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, all isolates of this uropathogenic E. coli strain carried a highly stable plasmid implicated in virulence of diverse pathogenic strains from all over the world. While virulence elements are certainly beneficial during infection scenarios, their role in gut colonization and pathogen persistence is poorly understood. We performed in vivo competitive fitness experiments to assess the role of this highly disseminated virulence plasmid in gut colonization, but found no evidence for a direct benefit of plasmid carriage. Through plasmid stability assays, we demonstrate that this plasmid is maintained in a parasitic manner, by strong first-line inheritance mechanisms, acting on the single-cell level, rather than providing a direct survival advantage in the gut. Investigating the ecology of endemic accessory genetic elements, in their pathogenic hosts and native environment, is of vital importance if we want to understand the evolution and persistence of highly virulent and drug resistant bacterial isolates.",

			"article_name": "Multiplex PCR detection of Cryptosporidium sp, Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica directly from dried stool samples from Guinea-Bissauan children with diarrhoea.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In developing countries, diarrhoea is the most common cause of death for children under five years of age, with Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium and Entamoeba histolytica as the most frequent pathogenic parasites. Traditional microscopy for stool parasites has poor sensitivity and specificity, while new molecular methods may provide more accurate diagnostics. In poor regions with sample storage hampered by uncertain electricity supply, research would benefit from a method capable of analysing dried stools. METHODS: A real-time multiplex PCR method with internal inhibition control was developed for detecting Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum and Entamoeba histolytica directly from stool specimens. Applicability to dried samples was checked by comparing with fresh ones in a small test material. Finally, the assay was applied to dried specimens collected from Guinea-Bissauan children with diarrhoea. RESULTS: The PCR's analytical sensitivity limit was 0.1 ng/ml for G. lamblia DNA, 0.01 ng/ml for E. histolytica DNA and 0.1 ng/ml for Cryptosporidium sp. In the test material, the assay performed similarly with fresh and dried stools. Of the 52 Guinea-Bissauan samples, local microscopy revealed a parasite in 15%, while PCR detected 62% positive for at least one parasite: 44% of the dried samples had Giardia, 23% Cryptosporidium and 0% E. histolytica. CONCLUSIONS: Our new multiplex real-time PCR for protozoa presents a sensitive method applicable to dried samples. As proof of concept, it worked well on stools collected from Guinea-Bissauan children with diarrhoea. It provides an epidemiological tool for analysing dried specimens from regions poor in resources.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the commonest gestational liver disease. The risk of adverse fetal outcome has been associated with the severity of maternal hypercholanemia after diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is a relationship between the severity and timing of onset of hypercholanemia and the risk of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) and adverse neonatal events. STUDY DESIGN: The study included 382 pregnancies complicated by ICP managed at a referral hospital in Buenos Aires (Argentina) between June 2009 and December 2013. The patients were classified into three groups according to the severity of hypercholanemia at diagnosis; mild (10-19.9 mumol/L), moderate (20-39.9 mumol/L) and severe (>/=40 mumol/L). Their clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were investigated in a prospective observational study. RESULTS: Higher risk of MSAF was observed when ICP appeared early in gestation or when hypercholanemia was more severe. Taking both parameters into account an MSAF risk factor (MRF) was defined. Based on a model of positive/negative predictive values, a cut-off point of MRF = 3 was selected, which prioritized sensitivity versus specificity. In ICP patients with MRF>3, the probability of MSAF was enhanced 4-fold. An increase in the frequency of MSAF was also associated with higher serum levels at diagnosis of alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of MSAF is associated not only with the magnitude of hypercholanemia at diagnosis but also with the early gestational onset of raised maternal serum bile acids.",

			"article_name": "Routine oro/nasopharyngeal suction versus no suction at birth.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oro/nasopharyngeal suction is a method used to clear secretions from the oropharynx and nasopharynx through the application of negative pressure via a suction catheter or bulb syringe. Traditionally, airway oro/nasopharyngeal suction at birth has been used routinely to remove fluid rapidly from the oropharynx and nasopharynx in vigorous and non-vigorous infants at birth. Concerns relating to the reported adverse effects of oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning led to a practice review and routine oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning is no longer recommended for vigorous infants. However, it is important to know whether there is any clear benefit or harm for infants whose oro/nasopharyngeal airway is suctioned compared to infants who are not suctioned. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of routine oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suction compared to no suction on mortality and morbidity in newly born infants. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to April 18, 2016), Embase (1980 to April 18, 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to April 18, 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, quasi-randomised controlled trials and cluster randomised trials that evaluated the effect of routine oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suction compared to no suction on mortality and morbidity in newly born infants with and without meconium-stained amniotic fluid. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The review authors extracted from the reports of the clinical trials, data regarding clinical outcomes including mortality, need for resuscitation, admission to neonatal intensive care, five minute Apgar score, episodes of apnoea and length of hospital stay. MAIN RESULTS: Eight randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and only included term infants (n = 4011). Five studies included infants with no fetal distress and clear amniotic fluid, one large study included vigorous infants with clear or meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and two large studies included infants with thin or thick meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Overall, there was no statistical difference between oro/nasopharyngeal suction and no oro/nasopharyngeal suction for all reported outcomes: mortality (typical RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.94 to 5.53; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.01; I(2) = 0%, studies = 2, participants = 3023), need for resuscitation (typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00; I(2) = 0%, studies = 5, participants = 3791), admission to NICU (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.08; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.01; I(2) = 27%, studies = 2, participants = 997) and Apgar scores at five minutes (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; I(2) not estimated, studies = 3, participants = 330). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The currently available evidence does not support or refute the benefits or harms of routine oro/nasopharyngeal suction over no suction. Further high-quality studies are required in preterm infants or term newborn infants with thick meconium amniotic fluid. Studies should investigate long-term effects such as neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

Recent data have demonstrated a strong link between gut microbial dysbiosis and development of NEC. We tested the hypothesis that alterations in the gut microbiome at the time of diagnosis predict the severity of NEC. METHODS: We used prospectively collected fecal samples from very low birth weight infants who developed NEC, stratifying by NEC severity. Fecal bacterial DNA was sequenced using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. A generalized Wald-type test based on the Dirichlet multinomial distribution was used to test for differences in microbial communities. RESULTS: Of 489 infants at risk, 30 NEC cases had 410 fecal samples collected in the 28days prior to the onset of NEC available for analysis. There were no differences in the pre-NEC gut microbial community between infants treated medically vs. surgically, or those with NEC totalis. Furthermore, neither treatment of NEC significantly changed the gut microbiome post-NEC among the survivors. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that the gut microbiome, prior to the onset of disease, differentiates the clinical course of NEC. These data suggest that factors other than the gut microbiome may dictate disease severity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.",

While the effects on fatty acid balance have been evaluated, the use of palm olein in combination with palm kernel oil and supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) has not been similarly assessed in infants. This study evaluated the effects of infant formulas containing different fat compositions on the balance of fat, fatty acids, and calcium. METHODS: In this randomized, crossover, double-blinded study, 33 healthy term infants (68-159 +/- 3 days of age at enrollment) were fed two formulas for 14 days in a tolerance period, followed by a 4-day metabolic balance period in 17 of the male subjects. The study compared two commercially available milk-based powdered formulas in Brazil; the PALM formula contained palm olein (44%), kernel palm oil (21.7%), and canola oil (18.5%) as the predominant fats, whereas the NoPALM formula contained other fat sources. RESULTS: Fat absorption (%) was greater for NoPALM versus PALM-fed infants (96.55 and 95.50%, respectively; p = 0.023). The absorption percentage of palmitic acid (C16:0) did not differ significantly between formulas (p > 0.05), but this acid was excreted at significantly higher concentrations in the PALM (29.42 mg/kg/day) than in the NoPALM (12.28 mg/kg/day) formula groups. DHA and ARA absorption percentages were also higher in NoPALM-fed infants. Calcium absorption was higher in NoPALM-fed infants (58.00%) compared to those fed PALM (40.90%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.104) when calcium intake was used as a covariate. However, calcium retention was higher in NoPALM-fed infants compared to that in PALM-fed infants with or without calcium intake as a covariate. Adverse events did not differ between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The absorption of essential fatty acids was similar for both formulas; however, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (DHA and ARA) were better absorbed from the NoPALM formula. Fat absorption and calcium retention were lower in term infants fed the PALM-based formula. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov # NCT00941564 .",

			"article_name": "Smoking in Pregnancy and Fetal Growth: The Case for More Intensive Assessment.",
			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many studies on prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) effects have relied on single item retrospective measures of PTE. However, it is unclear how these single item measures may relate to more intensive maternal self-reports and to biological markers of maternal use and/or fetal exposure. It is also unclear whether these measures may be more valid predictors of fetal growth (gestational age, birthweight, head circumference, and birth length). METHODS: Data were obtained from 258 women during their pregnancy. PTE was assessed by four methods: a single item question, a calendar-based self-report measure from each trimester of pregnancy, maternal salivary cotinine assays, and nicotine and metabolites in infant meconium. We hypothesized that the more intensive measures and biological assays would account for additional variance in birth outcomes, above and beyond the single item measure. RESULTS: The single item self-report measure was not related to fetal growth. However, the more intensive calendar based self-report measure and the biological assays of PTE (ie, maternal salivary assays and infant meconium) were significant predictors of poor fetal growth, even with the single item measure in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The negative effects of PTE on important child outcomes may be greatly underestimated in the literature as many studies use single item self-report measures to ascertain PTE. Whereas more intensive self-report measures or biological assays may be cost prohibitive in large scale epidemiological studies, using a combination of measures when possible should be considered given their superiority both identifying prenatal smokers and predicting poor fetal growth. IMPLICATIONS: The present work underscores the importance of measurement issues when assessing associations between PTE and fetal growth. Results suggest that we may be greatly underestimating the negative effects of prenatal smoking on fetal growth and other important child outcomes if we rely solely on restricted single item self-report measures of prenatal smoking. Researchers should consider more intensive prospective self-report measures and biological assays as viable and superior alternatives to single item self-report measures.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated fecal calprotectin (FC) is a non-invasive marker of inflammation indicating bowel disease. However, healthy infants have displayed high FC levels, with large variation. We sought to determine what factors might affect FC levels in children <6months old. METHODS: We recruited 133 healthy infants aged 0-6months from four Korean day care centers. Stool samples were analyzed by immunosorbent assay. All infants completed a questionnaire related to clinical characteristics including birth and feeding history. RESULTS: The mean FC concentration of all of participants was 237.40mug/g (range 11.5-1330.6mug/g). FC levels between 0 and 6months reduced with increasing age and the differences were statistically significant. The mean FC value according to feeding mode was 354.67mug/g for those fed breast milk and 149.44mug/g for those fed formula milk (p<0.001). Mean FC values were 319.69mug/g vs. 130.97mug/g for normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (NSVD) vs. caesarean section births, respectively (p<0.001). In addition, delivery mode affected the FC level at 0-6months regardless of feeding mode. CONCLUSION: The FC levels of infants aged 0-6months reduced with age and were higher than the normal levels observed in healthy older infants. The FC value at <7months was higher in infants who were fed breast milk and born by NSVD.",

The method was specific and sensitive; LOD was from 1 to 2ng/g, and LOQ from 4 to 10ng/g; linearity ranged from 4 to 400 ng/g for all the analytes, except for THC glucuronide (10-400ng/g); intra-assay, inter-assay and total imprecision were <11.2%, <13.45% and <15.6%, respectively; accuracy ranged from 93.9% to 109.0% of the target concentration; matrix effect, extraction and process efficiency ranged from -26.4% to -71.4%, 49.9% to 69.5% and 14.3% to 45.0%, respectively. The inclusion of THC and THCCOOH glucuronides avoided the need for the hydrolysis process, thus facilitating sample pretreatment. Application of the method to 19 authentic meconium specimens from uncontrolled pregnancies or women suspicious of drug consumption revealed fetal cannabis exposure in 4 newborns. THCCOOH (24.1-288.8ng/g), diOHTHC (53.2-332.4ng/g), THC (4.2-7.7ng/g), CBN (30.7-93.3ng/g) and CBD (7.1-251.5ng/g) were detected in all cases; THCCOOH glucuronide (190.2-306.8ng/g) in 3 cases; and OHTHC (11.9ng/g) in the remaining one; however, THC glucuronide was not identified in any specimen.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Government efforts to address massive shortfalls in rural water and sanitation in India have centred on construction of community water sources and toilets for selected households. However, deficiencies with water quality and quantity at the household level and community coverage and actual use of toilets have led Gram Vikas, a local non-governmental organization in Odisha, India, to develop an approach that provides household-level piped water connections contingent on full community-level toilet coverage. METHODS: This matched cohort study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a combined piped water and sanitation intervention. Households with children <5 years in 45 randomly selected intervention villages and 45 matched control villages will be followed over 17 months. The primary outcome is prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases; secondary health outcomes include soil-transmitted helminth infection, nutritional status, seroconversion to enteric pathogens, urogenital infections and environmental enteric dysfunction. In addition, intervention effects on sanitation and water coverage, access and use, environmental fecal contamination, women's empowerment, as well as collective efficacy, and intervention cost and cost-effectiveness will be assessed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the ethics boards of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK and KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed literature and presentation to stakeholders, government officials, implementers and researchers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02441699.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus colonization through the first year of life in a group of 12 Brazilian infants and to correlate these data with the levels of Escherichia coli. The presence of anaerobic members of the adult intestinal microbiota, including Eubacterium limosum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was also evaluated. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected during the first year of life, and 16S rRNA from anaerobic and facultative bacteria was detected by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium was present at the highest levels at all of the studied time points, followed by E. coli and Lactobacillus. E. limosum was rarely detected, and F. prausnitzii was detected only in the samples from the latest time points. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with reports throughout the world on the community structure of the intestinal microbiota in infants fed a milk diet. Our findings also provide evidence for the influence of the environment on intestinal colonization due to the high abundance of E. coli. The presence of important anaerobic genera was observed in Brazilian infants living at a low socioeconomic level, a result that has already been well established for infants living in developed countries.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (t-EPEC) are known to cause diarrhea in children but it is uncertain whether atypical EPEC (a-EPEC) do, since a-EPEC lack the bundle-forming pilus (bfp) gene that encodes a key adherence factor in t-EPEC. In culture-based studies of a-EPEC, the presence of another adherence factor, called EHEC factor for adherence/lymphocyte activation inhibitor (efa1/lifA), was strongly associated with diarrhea. Since a-EPEC culture is not feasible in clinical laboratories, we designed an efa1/lifA quantitative PCR assay and examined whether the presence of efa1/lifA was associated with higher a-EPEC bacterial loads in pediatric diarrheal stool samples. METHODS: Fecal samples from children with diarrhea were tested by qPCR for EPEC (presence of eae gene) and for shiga toxin genes to exclude enterohemorrhagic E. coli, which also contain the eae gene. EPEC containing samples were then tested for the bundle-forming pilus gene found in t-EPEC and efa1/lifA. The eae gene quantity in efa1/lifA-positive and negative samples was compared. RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 320 (12%) fecal samples tested positive for EPEC and 38/39 (97%) contained a-EPEC. The efa1/lifA gene was detected in 16/38 (42%) a-EPEC samples. The median eae concentration for efa1/lifA positive samples was significantly higher than for efa1/lifA negative samples (median 16,745 vs. 1183 copies/microL, respectively, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical enteropathogenic E. coli-positive diarrheal stool samples containing the efa1/lifA gene had significantly higher bacterial loads than samples lacking this gene. This supports the idea that efa1/lifA contributes to diarrheal pathogenesis and suggests that, in EPEC-positive samples, efa/lifA may be a useful additional molecular biomarker.",

METHODS: We analysed serial biosamples of infants who did (n = 13) or did not receive (n = 62) B. breve (3 x 10(9) cfu/day). Peripheral blood was obtained on days 1, 14 and 28, and infant stool prior to commencement of probiotic supplementation and on day 21. Levels of APP (bactericidal/permeability inducing protein (BPI), beta defensins 1 and 2, lactoferrin, human cathelicidin, secretory phospholipase A2) in plasma and stool were determined. Further, we characterised induced APP levels in whole blood cultured with live S. epidermidis or with agonists of Toll-like receptors 2/6 and 4. RESULTS: Stool, plasma and stimulated blood APP levels changed significantly during the first month of life. Supplementation with B. breve did not affect basal or stimulated APP levels except for a transient increase in inducible BPI. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with B. breve does not appear to act via modulation of systemic or enteric APP expression in preterm infants although small effects cannot be excluded. Further work with other probiotic preparations is warranted.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a catastrophic disease of preterm infants, and microbial dysbiosis has been implicated in its pathogenesis. Studies evaluating the microbiome in NEC and preterm infants lack power and have reported inconsistent results. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our objectives were to perform a systematic review and meta-analyses of stool microbiome profiles in preterm infants to discern and describe microbial dysbiosis prior to the onset of NEC and to explore heterogeneity among studies. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and conference abstracts from the proceedings of Pediatric Academic Societies and reference lists of relevant identified articles in April 2016. Studies comparing the intestinal microbiome in preterm infants who developed NEC to those of controls, using culture-independent molecular techniques and reported alpha and beta-diversity metrics, and microbial profiles were included. In addition, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequence data with clinical meta-data were requested from the authors of included studies or searched in public data repositories. We reprocessed the 16S rRNA sequence data through a uniform analysis pipeline, which were then synthesized by meta-analysis. We included 14 studies in this review, and data from eight studies were available for quantitative synthesis (106 NEC cases, 278 controls, 2944 samples). The age of NEC onset was at a mean +/- SD of 30.1 +/- 2.4 weeks post-conception (n = 61). Fecal microbiome from preterm infants with NEC had increased relative abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes prior to NEC onset. Alpha- or beta-diversity indices in preterm infants with NEC were not consistently different from controls, but we found differences in taxonomic profiles related to antibiotic exposure, formula feeding, and mode of delivery. Exploring heterogeneity revealed differences in microbial profiles by study and the target region of the 16S rRNA gene (V1-V3 or V3-V5). CONCLUSIONS: Microbial dysbiosis preceding NEC in preterm infants is characterized by increased relative abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Microbiome optimization may provide a novel strategy for preventing NEC.",

This study aimed to estimate their prevalence and provide a detailed analysis of geographical distribution of intestinal parasites in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, considering demographic, socio-economic, and epidemiological contextual factors. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cross-section survey was conducted among individuals attending the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (FIOCRUZ, RJ) during the period from April 2012 to February 2015. Stool samples were collected and processed by sedimentation, flotation, Kato-Katz, Baermann-Moraes and Graham methods, iron haematoxylin staining and safranin staining. Of the 3245 individuals analysed, 569 (17.5%) were infected with at least one parasite. The most common protozoa were Endolimax nana (28.8%), Entamoeba coli (14.8%), Complex Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (13.5%), Blastocystis hominis (12.7%), and Giardia lamblia (8.1%). Strongyloides stercoralis (4.3%), Schistosoma mansoni (3.3%), Ascaris lumbricoides (1.6%), and hookworms (1.5%) were the most frequent helminths. There was a high frequency of contamination by protozoa (87%), and multiple infections were observed in 141 participants (24.8%). A positive association between age (young children) and gender (male) with intestinal parasites was observed. Geospatial distribution of the detected intestinal parasitic infections was not random or homogeneous, but was influenced by socioeconomic conditions (through the material deprivation index (MDI)). Participants classified in the highest levels of deprivation had higher risk of having intestinal parasites. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides the first epidemiological information on the prevalence and distribution of intestinal parasitic infections in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. Intestinal parasites, especially protozoa, are highly prevalent, indicating that parasitic infections are still a serious public health problem. MDI showed that intestinal parasites were strongly associated with the socioeconomic status of the population, thus making it possible to identify social vulnerable areas.",

All isolates with phenotypic colistin resistance carried mcr-1. These data indicate that commensal carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli with mcr-1 among persons in rural China was already present in 2012 and that mcr-1 was the most important colistin resistance mechanism. Interventions are necessary to minimise further dissemination of mcr-1, which would limit the future usefulness of colistin as a last-resort antibiotic.",

To investigate the current genotypes of circulating HAdV strains, we performed molecular genotyping of HAdVs in the stool from patients with acute gastroenteritis and tried to determine their associations with clinical symptoms. From June 2014 to May 2016, 3,901 fecal samples were tested for an AdV antigen, and 254 samples (6.5%) yielded positive results. Genotyping using PCR and sequencing of the capsid hexon gene was performed for 236 AdV antigen-positive fecal specimens.

Other genotypes, including HAdV-3, HAdV-1, HAdV-5, HAdV-6, HAdV-31, HAdV-40, HAdV-12, and HAdV-55, were also detected. Overall, 119 patients (50.4%) showed concomitant respiratory symptoms, and 32 patients (13.6%) were diagnosed with intussusception. HAdV-1 and HAdV-31 were significantly associated with intussusception (P < 0.05). Our results demonstrate the recent changes in trends of circulating AdV genotypes associated with gastroenteritis in Korea, which should be of value for improving the diagnosis and developing new detection, treatment, and prevention strategies for broad application in clinical laboratories.",

Furthermore, C. ureolyticus was screened in these 283 samples by PCR assay, which can detect this species specifically. Surprisingly, C. ureolyticus was detected in 147 of the 283 C16S PCR-positive diarrheal stool samples (51.9%), which is much higher than the prevalence of C. jejuni and C. coli (15.5%), and 96 samples out of 147 were negative for any of the other enteric pathogens tested in the hospital; namely, C. ureolyticus was detected as a single pathogen in 96 samples.

To monitor changes in the RV genotypes before and after vaccine introduction, we performed a prospective observational study among children (\uff1c 5 years) with gastroenteritis who tested RV-positive on antigen rapid tests. Stool samples were collected from 3 different sites in Japan: Tsu City, Mie Prefecture; Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture; and Isumi City, Chiba Prefecture. RV genotypes were determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In Tsu City, G3P[8] was dominant (61.0-77.1%) before vaccine introduction, but decreased after introduction. Meanwhile, in an inverse proportion to the decrease in G3P[8], G1P[8] increased until the 2013/14 season, when a sudden predominance of G2P[4] (100%) occurred. A similar trend was observed in Kurashiki City in terms of the extent of reduction in G3P[8] and the emergence of G2P[4]. In Isumi City, G1P[8] was dominant (70.3%) before vaccine introduction, and G9P[8] became predominant (83.3%) in the 2013/14 season. To determine whether the genotype changes are attributable to vaccines or natural epidemiological changes, ongoing continuous monitoring of the RV genotypes is required.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cryptosporidiosis is a common disease of children and immune-compromised persons. This study evaluated the diversity and distribution of Cryptosporidium species in diarrheal children and HIV-infected persons on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and those not on HAART. METHODOLOGY: A total of 394 fecal specimens were collected from patients attending clinics in Nsukka and Ebonyi, Nigeria. Detection and identification of Cryptosporidium species were conducted by PCR-RFLP of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, whereas subtyping was done by sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. RESULTS: Twenty-five (6.3%) specimens yielded four Cryptosporidium species, including C. hominis, C. parvum, C. felis, and C. viatorum. C. hominis was the most dominant species with 48.0% occurrence and three identified subtype families: Ia (six specimens), Ib (three specimens), Ie (two specimens), and one un-subtyped species. C. parvum had 44.0% occurrence and two subtype families: IIc (eight specimens) and IIe (three specimens), while C. felis and C. viatorum each had 4.0% occurrence. There were significant differences in Cryptosporidium species distribution between age groups in children and HIV-infected persons, between suburban and urban areas, and between low and high CD4+ cell counts in HIV-infected patients. There were no significant differences in infection rate and species distribution between HIV-infected patients on HAART and those not on HAART. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study show that there is a high diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in humans in Ebonyi and Nsukka, Nigeria, and that all the C. parvum subtypes identified are most likely anthroponotic in origin.",

			"abstract": "PURPOSE: Very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs) are at risk of surgical intestinal disorders including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), focal intestinal perforation (FIP), and meconium-related ileus (MRI). We conducted this study to verify whether the timing of stoma closure and that of enteral nutrition establishment after stoma closure in VLBWIs differ among the most common disorders. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was conducted at 11 institutes. We reviewed the timing of stoma closure and enteral nutrition establishment in VLBWIs who underwent stoma creation for intestinal disorders. RESULTS: We reviewed the medical records of 73 infants: 21 with NEC, 24 with FIP, and 25 with MRI. The postnatal age at stoma closure was 107 (28-359) days for NEC, 97 (25-302) days for FIP, and 101 (15-264) days for MRI (p = 0.793), and the postnatal age at establishment of enteral nutrition was 129 (42-381) days for NEC, 117 (41-325) days for FIP, and 128 (25-308) days for MRI (p = 0.855). The body weights at stoma closure were 1768 (620-3869) g for NEC, 1669 (1100-3040) g for FIP, and 1632 (940-3776) g (p = 0.614) for MRI. There were no significant differences among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that the time and body weights at stoma closure and the postoperative restoration of bowel function in VLBWIs did not differ among the three diseases.",

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we administered 8 g/day of FOS or sucrose to 84 women from the 26th week of gestation to one month after delivery. The bifidobacteria count was detected using quantitative PCR in maternal (26 and 36 weeks of gestation) and neonatal (one month after delivery) stools. Maternal stool frequency was recorded from 24 to 36 weeks of gestation. The number of fecal Bifidobacterium spp. and Bifidobacterium longum in the FOS group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group at 36 weeks of gestation (2.7 x 10(10)/g vs. 1.1 x 10(10)/g and 2.3 x 10(10)/g vs. 9.7 x 10(8)/g). In their neonates, these numbers did not differ between the groups. Also, stool frequency in the FOS group was slightly higher than that in the placebo group two weeks after the intervention (1.0 vs. 0.8 times/day), suggesting a potential constipation alleviation effect. In conclusion, the maternal FOS ingestion showed a bifidogenic effect in pregnant women but not in their neonates.",

			"abstract": "Prenatal psychoactive substance exposure has significant impact on neonatal health and child development and the development of reliable biomarkers is critical. Meconium presents several advantages for detecting prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances, as it is easy to collect and provides a broad time frame of exposure (third trimester). The aim of our study was to compare the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and/or cannabis use during the third trimester of pregnancy (using maternal self-reports) with the results of meconium testing of their metabolites in newborns (cotinine, ethyl-glucuronide (EtG) and cannabinoid metabolites). Among all deliveries (993) that occurred in all maternities in Rouen (Normandy) during a defined time period (5 consecutive weeks in August, 2010 and August, 2011), 724 mothers were included and 645 meconium samples were collected. Maternal self-reports, using the Addiction Severity Index (5th edition), and meconium samples were collected within 72 h of delivery. Cotinine detection appears highly correlated to maternal self-reports (Kappa value: 0.79; [95%CI: 0.73-0.85]). Moreover, detection in meconium seems more accurate in the prediction of neonatal consequences of prenatal tobacco exposure as compared to maternal self-reports. In contrast, we have found a lower concordance between maternal self-reports and meconium testing for EtG and cannabinoid metabolites (Kappa value: 0.13; [95%CI: 0.04-0.22] and: 0.30; [95%CI: -0.03-0.63], respectively); however the total number of EtG- and cannabinoid-positive meconium samples was small. Interestingly, meconium samples with the highest levels of EtG mainly corresponded to negative maternal self-reports. Fetal exposure to alcohol, tobacco or cannabis may also considerably differ as displayed in our pairs of dizygotic twins. Finally, a polyconsumption of these psychoactive substances was not frequently observed according to meconium testing. In conclusion, cotinine detection appears as a valuable meconium biomarker. EtG measurement in meconium samples seems interesting if there is any risk of high fetal exposure, whereas assessment of prenatal cannabis exposure, using meconium testing, needs to be improved.",

In this study, faecal samples were obtained from different age groups (neonatal babies, preschool children, school-going children, adolescents, adults and elderly) of a southern Indian population, and from a tribal population also resident in southern India). 16S rRNA gene sequences specific to Archaea were amplified from pooled faecal DNA in each group, sequenced, and aligned against the NCBI database. Of the 806 adequate sequences in the study, most aligned with 22 known sequences. There were 9 novel sequences in the present study. All sequences were deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence database with the following accession numbers: KF607113 - KF607918. Methanobrevibacter was the most prevalent genus among all the age groups accounting for 98% in neonates, 96% in post-weaning, and 100% each in preschool, school and adult population. In the elderly, Methanobrevibacter accounted for 96% and in tribal adults, 99% of the clones belonged to Methanobrevibacter genus. Other genera detected included Caldisphaera, Halobaculum, Methanosphaeraand Thermogymnomonas. Methanobrevibacter smithii predominated in all age groups, accounting for 749 (92.9%) of the 806 sequences. Archaea can be found in the faeces of southern Indian residents immediately after birth. Methanobrevibacter smithii was the dominant faecal archeon in all age groups, with other genera being found at the extremes of age.",

			"abstract": "Exposure to aflatoxin, a mycotoxin common in many foods, has been associated with child growth impairment in sub-Saharan Africa. To improve our understanding of growth impairment in relation to aflatoxin and other risk factors, we assessed biospecimens collected in Nepalese children at 15, 24, and 36 months of age for aflatoxin exposure. Children (N = 85) enrolled in the Bhaktapur, Nepal MAL-ED study encompassed the cohort analysed in this study. Exposure was assessed through a plasma biomarker of aflatoxin exposure: the AFB1-lysine adduct. The aflatoxin exposures in the study participants were compared to anthropometrics at each time period (length-for-age [LAZ], weight-for-age [WAZ], and weight-for-length [WLZ] z-scores), growth trajectories over time, age, and breastfeeding status. Results demonstrated chronic aflatoxin exposure in this cohort of children, with a geometric mean of 3.62 pg AFB1-lysine/mg albumin. However, the chronic aflatoxin exposure in this cohort was not significantly associated with anthropometric z-scores, growth trajectories, age, or feeding status, based on the available time points to assess aflatoxin exposure. Low mean levels of aflatoxin exposure and infrequent occurrence of stunting, wasting, or underweight z-score values in this cohort are possible contributing factors to a lack of evidence for an association. Further research is needed to examine whether a threshold dose of aflatoxin exists that could induce child growth impairment.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a marker of inflammation in the intestinal tract. We assessed FC levels longitudinally in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and evaluated the relation between FC results and relevant markers of disease. METHODS: Calprotectin was measured in fecal samples starting in 2003 and values were stored in the center's patient database. In this retrospective analysis, we searched for associations of FC concentrations with disease severity and progression. Linear mixed effects models were used to model the logarithm of FC levels. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients (0-61 years) had 2434 FC measurements between 2003 and 2015, with a total observation period of 1686 patient-years. Median (interquartile range) FC concentrations were 60.9 (75.9) mug/g and 61% of the samples showed elevated FC concentrations (>50 mug/g). Despite some statistically significant effects, there was no clinically relevant association among FC and sex, age, forced expiratory volume in 1 second z score, or body mass index z score. Pancreatic insufficiency (ie, fecal elastase <100 mug/g stool) was associated with considerably higher FC values compared to normal pancreatic function (median FC 68 vs 29 mug/g, P < 0.0001). F508del homozygous subjects showed a trend to higher FC values than heterozygous patients (median 71 vs 62 mug/g, P = 0.173). In addition, a significant association with increasing serum C-reactive protein concentrations (P < 0.0001) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: FC was elevated in two-thirds of stool specimens. Increased FC was more common in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. Whether increased FC reflects intestinal inflammation in patients with CF remains to be determined.",

We describe here the epidemiology of infection with Giardia in the first 2 years of life in the Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development Project (MAL-ED), a multisite birth-cohort study. METHODS. From 2089 children, 34916 stool samples collected during monthly surveillance and episodes of diarrhea were tested for Giardia using an enzyme immunoassay. We quantified the risk of Giardia detection, identified risk factors, and assessed the associations with micronutrients, markers of gut inflammation and permeability, diarrhea, and growth using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS. The incidence of at least 1 Giardia detection varied according to site (range, 37.7%-96.4%) and was higher in the second year of life. Exclusive breastfeeding (HR for first Giardia detection in a monthly surveillance stool sample, 0.46 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.75]), higher socioeconomic status (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.97]), and recent metronidazole treatment (risk ratio for any surveillance stool detection, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56-0.84]) were protective. Persistence of Giardia (consecutive detections) in the first 6 months of life was associated with reduced subsequent diarrheal rates in Naushahro Feroze, Pakistan but not at any other site. Giardia detection was also associated with an increased lactulose/mannitol ratio. Persistence of Giardia before 6 months of age was associated with a -0.29 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.05) deficit in weight-for-age z score and -0.29 (95% CI, -0.64 to 0.07) deficit in length-for-age z score at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS. Infection with Giardia occurred across epidemiological contexts, and repeated detections in 40% of the children suggest that persistent infections were common. Early persistent infection with Giardia, independent of diarrhea, might contribute to intestinal permeability and stunted growth.",

METHODS: We prospectively recruited diarrheal children in an outpatient setting. Nondiarrheal controls were individually matched to cases. Rotavirus, norovirus and bacterial pathogens were examined. Clinical and epidemiologic data were obtained at enrollment and follow-up. RESULTS: Potential pathogens identified in 680 diarrheal cases and 680 controls were rotavirus (19.0% vs. 1.3%), norovirus (13.4% vs. 4.7%), nontyphoidal Salmonella (9.3% vs. 1.9%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (8.4% vs. 6.9%) and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (7.2% vs. 6.2%) and Campylobacter (5.1% vs. 1.2%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (1.2% vs. 0.6%), enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (0.3% vs. 0%) and Shigella (0.15% vs. 0%), respectively. The specificity and sensitivity of fecal leukocytes >5 per high-power field for the diagnosis of bacterial diarrhea were 94.2% and 22.8%. Salmonella were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin-clavulanate and showed low frequency of resistance to azithromycin. Campylobacter showed low frequency of resistance to azithromycin and high frequency of resistance to ciprofloxacin. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli was highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Contact with diarrheal patients was a risk factor for rotavirus [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 11.7], norovirus (aOR: 7.5) and Campylobacter (aOR: 27.1) infections. Mother's education was positively associated with Salmonella infection (aOR: 2.1). Good hand hygiene was protective against rotavirus (aOR: 0.6), norovirus (aOR: 0.5) and Salmonella (aOR: 0.3) infections. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus, norovirus, nontyphoidal Salmonella and Campylobacter are significantly associated with diarrhea in Chinese children. Fecal leukocytes >5 per high-power field can predict bacterial diarrhea. Target prevention and appropriate treatment of diarrhea should consider the potential pathogen and resistance pattern.",

RESULTS: In the 174 included children (87 boys), 95th Percentile values ranged from 1519 mg/kg at 0 months to 54.4 mg/kg at 144 months for fCP and from 9.9 mg/kg at 0 months to 0.2 mg/kg at 144 months for fEDN. There was a statistically significant association between age and fCP concentrations (P < 0.001) and age and fEDN concentrations (P < 0.001). We also found a statistically significant association between fEDN and fCP concentrations (rho = 0.52, P < 0.001). According to our results, we provide a nomogram and we suggest 3 different age groups for evaluation of fCP and fEDN concentrations, the 95th percentile being respectively 910.3 and 7.4 mg/kg for 0-12 months, 285.9 and 2.9 mg/kg for >1 to 4 years, and 54.4 and 0.2 mg/kg for >4 to 12 years. DISCUSSION: By using an improved analytical method, we have confirmed that young healthy children have higher fCP concentrations than healthy adults. We, for the first time, report reference values for fEDN concentrations in a pediatric population. The proposed nomograms and reference values for fCP and fEDN are aimed at facilitating the applicability of biomarkers for both neutrophil- and eosinophil-mediated intestinal inflammation in children in clinical practice.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: One third of travellers to the poor regions of the (sub)tropics become colonized by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). Co-resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics complicates the treatment of potential ESBL-PE infections. METHODS: We analysed co-resistance to non-beta-lactams among travel-acquired ESBL-PE isolates of 90 visitors to the (sub)tropics with respect to major risk factors of colonization: destination, age, travellers' diarrhoea (TD) and antibiotic (AB) use. RESULTS: Of the ESBL-PE isolates, 53%, 52%, 73%, and 2% proved co-resistant to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, co-trimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin, respectively. The rates were similar among those with (TD+) or without (TD-) travellers' diarrhoea. Among fluoroquinolone-users vs. AB non-users, the co-resistance rates for ciprofloxacin were 95% versus 37% (p = 0.001), for tobramycin 85% versus 43% (p = 0.005), co-trimoxazole 85% versus 68% (p = 0.146), and nitrofurantoin 5% versus 2% (p = 0.147). In multivariable analysis co-resistance to ciprofloxacin was associated with increasing age, fluoroquinolone use, and tobramycin resistance. CONLUSIONS: While TD predisposes to ESBL-PE non-selectively, antimicrobial use favours strains resistant to drug taken and, simultaneously, any drug with resistance genetically linked to the drug used. Antibiotics taken during travel predispose to ESBL-PE with a high co-resistance rate.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tract is not the common infection site of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The role of P. aeruginosa as a causative agent for diarrhea in children without preexisting disease is controversial. METHODS: From 2003 to 2012, we reviewed the records of 259 diarrheal patients less than 5 years of age whose stool culture grew P. aeruginosa. Virulence phenotypes of bacterial isolates were determined in vitro, including cytotoxicity, penetration and adherence to epithelial cells. RESULTS: The presence of P. aeruginosa in children with diarrhea less than 5 years old is 0.91%. P. aeruginosa-associated diarrheal diseases were classified into 4 groups: Shanghai fever (enteric infection and sepsis) (5%), P. aeruginosa enterocolitis (15%), P. aeruginosa-related diarrhea (19%) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (43%). The remaining patients had coinfection with other pathogens (18%). Shanghai fever was the most severe enteric disease with invasive infection and complications. The clinical features of P. aeruginosa enterocolitis were prolonged fever with bloody or mucoid diarrhea mimicking bacterial enterocolitis. The clinical features of P. aeruginosa-related diarrhea and antibiotic-associated diarrhea were similar to viral or toxin-mediated diarrhea. Compared with other P. aeruginosa-associated diarrheal diseases, patients with Shanghai fever were younger, usually infants, and the characteristic laboratory findings included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, high C-reactive protein, hyponatremia and hyperglycemia. Except for Shanghai fever, antibiotic treatment is not recommended. Isolates from Shanghai fever were more cytotoxic and adherent than isolates from uncomplicated diarrheal patients. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa could be an enteric pathogen even in healthy children. Young age and highly virulent bacterial strains were risk factors for Shanghai fever.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to result in high morbidity and mortality in children from resource-limited settings. Diagnostic challenges, including resource-intense sputum collection methods and insensitive diagnostic tests, contribute to diagnostic delay and poor outcomes in children. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of stool Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) compared with bacteriologic confirmation (combination of Xpert and culture of respiratory samples). METHODS: In a hospital-based study in Cape Town, South Africa, we enrolled children younger than 13 years of age with suspected pulmonary TB from April 2012 to August 2015. Standard clinical investigations included tuberculin skin test, chest radiograph and HIV testing. Respiratory samples for smear microscopy, Xpert and liquid culture included gastric aspirates, induced sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates and expectorated sputum. One stool sample per child was collected and tested using Xpert. RESULTS: Of 379 children enrolled (median age, 15.9 months, 13.7% HIV infected), 73 (19.3%) had bacteriologically confirmed TB. The sensitivity and specificity of stool Xpert versus overall bacteriologic confirmation were 31.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 21.84%-44.50%] and 99.7% (95% CI: 98.2%-100%), respectively. A total of 23/51 (45.1%) children with bacteriologically confirmed TB with severe disease were stool Xpert positive. Cavities on chest radiograph were associated with Xpert stool positivity regardless of age and other relevant factors [odds ratios (OR) 7.05; 95% CI: 2.16-22.98; P = 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Stool Xpert can rapidly confirm TB in children who present with radiologic findings suggestive of severe TB. In resource-limited settings where children frequently present with advanced disease, Xpert on stool samples could improve access to rapid diagnostic confirmation and appropriate treatment.",

Environmental conditions such as the presence of bioactive molecules from breast milk dictate gut microbial growth and survival. Infants also receive distinct, personalized, bacterial exposures leading to differential colonization. Microbial exposures and gut environmental conditions differ between infants in different locations, as does the typical microbial community structure in an infant's gut. Here we evaluate potential influences on the infant gut microbiota through a longitudinal study on cohorts of breast-fed infants from the neighboring countries of Armenia and Georgia, an area of the world for which the infant microbiome has not been previously investigated. Marker gene sequencing of 16S ribosomal genes revealed that the gut microbial communities of infants from these countries were dominated by bifidobacteria, were different from each other, and were marginally influenced by their mother's secretor status. Species-level differences in the bifidobacterial communities of each country and birth method were also observed. These community differences suggest that environmental variation between individuals in different locations may influence the gut microbiota of infants.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The authors examined the changes in the developing gut microbiota of Indian infants enrolled in a colonization study of an oral synbiotic (Lactobacillus plantarum and fructo-oligosaccharides) preparation. METHODS: Frozen stool samples were available from a previously published clinical study of the synbiotic preparation administered daily for 7 days to full-term Indian infants delivered by C-section. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal bacterial community-DNA was done in 11 infants sampled on day 7 and day 60 of life. RESULTS: All infants showed changes in bacterial diversity with age. While Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were predominant in all, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were initially low on day 7. In control infants, we observed a significant increase (P = 0.012) in the proportions of Actinobacteria on day 60. In the treated group, during the 60-day period, there was a 10-fold increase in Bacteroidetes, a somewhat smaller increase in Firmicutes, and a reduction in Proteobacteria. Compared to controls, treated infants were increasingly colonized by different Gram-positive genera including Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium. Relatively less known taxa and some unassigned sequence reads added to enriched diversity observed in the treated group. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high level of bacterial diversity among infants examined in the present study. Synbiotic treatment induced an increase in overall taxa and Gram-positive diversity, especially in the first week of life. Changes in the microbiota during early infancy should be used as a rationale for selecting probiotics in diverse clinical settings.",

Gut colonisation can be modified by probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are infant prebiotics that show a bifidogenic effect. Moreover, genome sequencing of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis within the infant microbiome revealed adaptations for milk utilisation. This study aimed to evaluate the synbiotic effect of B. longum subsp. infantis, HMOs and human milk (HM) both in vitro and in vivo (in a humanised mouse model) in the presence of faecal microbiota from infants born by caesarean section. The combination of B. longum and HMOs or HM reduced the clostridia and G-bacteria counts both in vitro and in vivo. The bifidobacterial population in vitro significantly increased and produce high concentrations of acetate and lactate. In vitro competition assays confirmed that the tested bifidobacterial strain is a potential probiotic for infants and, together with HMOs or HM, acts as a synbiotic. It is also able to inhibit potentially pathogenic bacteria. The synbiotic effects identified in vitro were not observed in vivo. However, there was a significant reduction in clostridia counts in both experimental animal groups (HMOs + B. longum and HM + B. longum), and a specific immune response via increased interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6 production. Animal models do not perfectly mimic human conditions; however, they are essential for testing the safety of functional foods.",

METHODS: Using data from a health facility-based surveillance study of children <5 years in Lusaka Province, Zambia presenting with diarrhea, we assessed the burden of norovirus infection. A convenience sample of 454 stool specimens was tested for norovirus using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR positive samples underwent additional nucleotide sequencing for genogroup and genotype identification. Clinical features and severity of diarrheal illnesses were compared between norovirus-positive and -negative subjects using Chi-squared and t-tests. RESULTS: Norovirus was detected in 52/454 (11.5%) specimens tested. Abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting were the most common presenting features in norovirus-associated illnesses. However, there were no significant differences in the clinical features of norovirus-positive compared to norovirus-negative illnesses. Of 43 isolates that were available for sequencing, 31 (72.1%) were genogroup II (GII) and 12 (27.9%) were genogroup I (GI). The distribution of genotypes was diverse. CONCLUSIONS: Noroviruses were detected in approximately 10% of young children with diarrhea in the Lusaka Province of Zambia, with GII representing the majority of infections. These findings support the role of norovirus in symptomatic diarrhea disease in Africa. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations and to evaluate prevention strategies.",

			"abstract": "Human microbial communities are characterized by their taxonomic, metagenomic and metabolic diversity, which varies by distinct body sites and influences human physiology. However, when and how microbial communities within each body niche acquire unique taxonomical and functional signatures in early life remains underexplored. We thus sought to determine the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota across multiple body sites and assess the effect of the mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women in their early third trimester (n = 81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks after delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n = 81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at the time of delivery. Samples across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina were collected for each maternal-infant dyad. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing and sequencing analysis of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA were performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogeneous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of the neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks after delivery, the infant microbiota structure and function had substantially expanded and diversified, with the body site serving as the primary determinant of the composition of the bacterial community and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with the cesarean mode of delivery in some body sites (oral gingiva, nares and skin; R(2) = 0.038), this was not true for neonatal stool (meconium; Mann-Whitney P > 0.05), and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. For infants at 6 weeks of age, the microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (P < 0.001, R(2) = 0.189) but without discernable differences in community structure or function between infants delivered vaginally or by cesarean surgery (P = 0.057, R(2) = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes substantial reorganization, which is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.",

To characterize the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in humans in southern Assam, India, stool samples (n = 1119) of diarrhea patients were collected from different hospitals and from the community during the period January 2014 to July 2016. Fecal smears were examined microscopically for Cryptosporidium species using modified acid fast staining and were screened to ascertain the presence of Cryptosporidium antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The genomic DNA of positive fecal samples were analyzed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which were subsequently genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), based on small subunit (SSU) 18S rRNA. It was found that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was high during the monsoon season. The average infection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. was found to be 2.4% (27/1119) microscopically. When subjected to nested PCR using amplification of the 18S rRNA gene, Cryptosporidium was found to be 8.57% (98/1119). Based on the 18S rRNA gene, two Cryptosporidium spp., namely Cryptosporidium andersoni (6.97%: 78/1119) and Cryptosporidium parvum (1.7%: 20/1119), were identified.

The aim of this study was to characterise the initial gut microbiota development of a cohort of breastfed infants (n = 192\ufeff) from 1 to 24 weeks of age. METHODS: V4-V5 region 16S rRNA amplicon Illumina sequencing and, in parallel, bacteriological culture. The metabolomic profile of infant urine at 4 weeks of age was also examined by LC-MS. RESULTS: Full-term (FT), spontaneous vaginally delivered (SVD) infants' microbiota remained stable at both phylum and genus levels during the 24-week period examined. FT Caesarean section (CS) infants displayed an increased faecal abundance of Firmicutes (p < 0.01) and lower abundance of Actinobacteria (p < 0.001) after the first week of life compared to FT-SVD infants. FT-CS infants gradually progressed to harbouring a microbiota closely resembling FT-SVD (which remained stable) by week 8 of life, which was maintained at week 24. The gut microbiota of preterm (PT) infants displayed a significantly greater abundance of Proteobacteria compared to FT infants (p < 0.001) at week 1. Metabolomic analysis of urine at week 4 indicated PT-CS infants have a functionally different metabolite profile than FT (both CS and SVD) infants. Co-inertia analysis showed co-variation between the urine metabolome and the faecal microbiota of the infants. Tryptophan and tyrosine metabolic pathways, as well as fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, were found to be affected by delivery mode and gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that mode of delivery and gestational age both have significant effects on early neonatal microbiota composition. There is also a significant difference between the metabolite profile of FT and PT infants. Prolonged breastfeeding was shown to have a significant effect on the microbiota composition of FT-CS infants at 24 weeks of age, but interestingly not on that of FT-SVD infants. Twins had more similar microbiota to one another than between two random infants, reflecting the influence of similarities in both host genetics and the environment on the microbiota.\ufeff.",

All samples underwent \"head to head\" re-testing using both RCA and direct fluorescence assay (DFA). Community level results from three sites indicated that 54.4% (166/305) of Meridian ImmunoCard STAT! positives and 87.0% (67/77) of Remel Xpect positives were confirmed by DFA. When samples were retested by RCA at state laboratories and compared with DFA, 83.3% (155/186) of Meridian ImmunoCard STAT! positives and 95.2% (60/63) of Remel Xpect positives were confirmed. The percentage of confirmed community results varied by site: Minnesota, 39.0%; New York, 63.9%; and Wisconsin, 72.1%. The percentage of confirmed community results decreased with patient age; 12.5% of community positive tests could be confirmed by DFA for patients 60 years of age or older. The percentage of confirmed results did not differ significantly by sex, storage temperature, time between sample collection and testing, or season. Findings from this study demonstrate a lower confirmation rate of community RCA positives when compared to RCA positives identified at state laboratories. Elucidating the causes of decreased test performance in order to improve overall community laboratory performance of these tests is critical for understanding the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in the United States (US).",

			"abstract": "Jaundice and pale stools are major indicators of neonatal liver disease. Prognosis depends on timely diagnosis and management. We evaluated the clinical practices among healthcare professionals concerning jaundiced newborns and their ability to recognize pale stools. We supplied a questionnaire and a panel with eight photographs of stools, both locally validated, to physicians and nurses of the National Healthcare Service. Analysis was conducted according to professional status, specialization and years of experience of professionals and level of healthcare. Questionnaires were administered to 266 participants (100 physicians, 166 nurses). The decision to send patients to medical observation depended on the intensity of jaundice for a significant percentage of nurses. Concerning jaundiced newborns breastfed and otherwise healthy, 28.9% of physicians would never request a conjugated bilirubin assay, and only 43.3% would request it after 14 days old; for those with other signs/symptoms of disease, only 69.1% of physicians would request it immediately. Multiple linear regression analysis identified specialization as an independent variable significantly associated with the ability to recognize pale stools. CONCLUSION: A significant percentage of healthcare professionals assumed clinical practices that preclude the timely recognition of cholestasis/pale stools, reinforcing the idea of educational needs. Specialization, rather than years of experience of professionals, was associated with better skills and practices. What is Known: * Neonatal cholestasis is a condition with some rare underlying entities having high mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis is crucial to improve prognosis. Yet, many cases remain late recognized and referred. * Studies evaluating the ability of healthcare professionals to recognize neonatal cholestasis are scarce. What is New: * In this study, a significant percentage of professionals assumed clinical practices that preclude timely recognition of neonatal cholestasis and pale stools, reinforcing the idea of educational needs. * Specialization of professionals was associated with better skills and practices.",

			"abstract": "AIM: To assess the burden of norovirus (NoV) and to determine the diversity of circulating strains among hospitalized children in Lebanon. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children presenting with acute gastroenteritis to six major hospitals in Lebanon. A total of 739 eligible stool samples, testing negative for diarrhea caused by rotavirus as a possible viral pathogen, were collected between January 2011 and June 2013. A standardized questionnaire including demographic, epidemiological and clinical observations was used at the time of hospitalization of children presenting with diarrhea. Viral RNA was extracted from stool samples followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing of a fragment of the viral protein 1 capsid gene. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA 6 software. RESULTS: Overall, 11.2% of stool samples collected from children aged < 5 years tested positive for NoV genogroups I (GI) and II (GII). GII accounted for 10.6% of the gastroenteritis cases with only five samples being positive for GI (0.7%). The majority of hospitalized children showed symptoms of diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting and fever. Upon sequencing of positive samples and based on their clustering in the phylogenetic tree, 4/5 of GI gastroenteritis cases were designated GI.3 and one case as GI.4. GII.4 was predominantly detected in stool of our study participants (68%). We report a JB-15/KOR/2008 GII.4 Apeldoorn 2008-like variant strain circulating in 2011; this strain was replaced between 2012 and 2013 by a variant sharing homology with the Sydney/NSW0514/2012/AUS GII.4 Sydney 2012 and Sydney 2012/FRA GII.4 strains. We also report the co-circulation of non-GII.4 genotypes among hospitalized children. Our data show that NoV gastroenteritis can occur throughout the year with the highest number of cases detected during the hot months. CONCLUSION: The majority of NoV-associated viral gastroenteritis cases among our participants are attributable to GII.4, which is compatible with results reported worldwide.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus (RV) vaccination using RotaTeq((R)) vaccine exclusively was introduced into Finnish National Immunization Program (NIP) in 2009, and soon reached high (>/=90%) coverage. Since mid-2013, all stool samples from laboratory diagnosed cases of RV gastroenteritis in the entire country have been typed. METHODS: 364 RV positive stool samples collected from clinical laboratories over a 2-year period were G- and P-typed using RT-PCR, and the results were confirmed by sequencing. In addition, the genome segment encoding for VP6 was sequenced to distinguish between wild-type and vaccine origin (bovine) RVs. RESULTS: RV winter epidemic seasons 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 lasted until July each. The age distribution of RV cases showed two unusual clusters: one in children 6-16 years of age, too old to have been vaccinated in NIP, and the other in elderly over 70 years of age. In children, diverse genotypes were observed without any obvious predominance. The most common ones were G1P[8] (30.0%), G2P[4] (22.4%), G9P[8] (15.8%), G3P[8] (12.2%) and G4P[8] (11.2%). The genotype distribution was not different among vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Most cases in the elderly were associated with G2P[4]. CONCLUSIONS: Even at high vaccine coverage and high effectiveness of RV vaccine, RV activity continues to persist, particularly in unvaccinated older children. RV genotypes show greater diversity than before RV vaccinations. We conclude that RV disease can be controlled but not eliminated by vaccinations. Herd-protection in long-term follow-up may be less than at the start of RV vaccinations.",

The levels of cord blood plasma MDA and 8-OH-dG were significantly higher in full-term and late-preterm newborns born through MSAF. On further comparison, it was found that both full-term and late-preterm intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) neonates had higher levels of these markers as compared to babies born as appropriate for gestational age (AGA) through MSAF. Plasma levels of MDA and 8-OH-dG were significantly correlated with birth weight even after controlling the relationship with gestational age for all cases as well as all full-term cases. These markers are also significantly correlated to each other. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggest that the neonates born through MSAF experience higher degrees of oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased levels of cord blood plasma MDA and 8-OH-dG. What is known: * Aspirated meconium has been found to induce free radical generation and cellular damage in animal studies. * Its role in free radical generation and oxidative damage in human neonates is scarce. What is new: * Neonates born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid experience significant oxidative stress.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intestinal bile salts (BSs) may be implicated in NEC development. We hypothesized that fecal BS levels are higher in preterm infants at risk for NEC. METHODS: We compared the composition and concentration of fecal BSs in ten preterm infants who developed NEC (Bell's Stage >/= II) with twenty matched control infants without NEC. Conjugated and unconjugated fecal BSs were measured after birth (T1) and twice prior to NEC (T2, T3). Data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges. RESULTS: GA and BW were similar in all preterms: ~27+4 weeks and ~1010 g. Age of NEC onset was day 10 (8-24). T1 was collected 2 (1-3) days after birth. T2 and T3 were collected 5 (5-6) days and 1 (0-2) day before NEC or at corresponding postnatal ages in controls. The composition of conjugated BSs did not differ between the two groups. Total unconjugated BSs were 3-fold higher before NEC compared to controls at corresponding ages (0.41 mumol/g feces (0.21-0.74) versus 0.14 mumol/g feces (0.06-0.46), p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fecal BS concentrations are higher in preterm infants who develop NEC compared to infants without NEC. Further study is needed to determine the predictive value of fecal BSs in the development of NEC.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the faecal carriage and molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) isolated from rectal samples of neonates hospitalised in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a university hospital in Fez, Morocco. METHODS: From February-July 2013, all neonates hospitalised in the NICU were screened for ESBLE carriage at discharge. ESBLs were identified by double-disk synergy test, PCR and DNA sequencing analysis. ESBLE were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and conjugation was performed by the broth mating method. RESULTS: In this study, 169 Enterobacteriaceae were collected from 164 neonates. The prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBLE was 58.0% (98/169), predominantly Klebsiella pneumoniae (65/98; 66.3%). A high rate of multiresistance in ESBLE was noted. bla(CTX-M-1) group (78.5%) was the most frequent ESBL gene detected, and all isolates harboured the CTX-M-15 variant. The prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae was 1.8%, and bla(OXA-48) was the only gene found in these isolates. Sequencing revealed subgroups corresponding to bla((CTX-M-15,TEM-1,TEM-104,SHV-1,SHV-44,SHV-49andSHV-133)) genes. Conjugation experiments showed the transferability of bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(TEM), but not bla(SHV). These genes were carried by a high-molecular-weight conjugative plasmid (ca. 125kb). PFGE profiles demonstrated high clonal dissemination of ESBL-positive strains in the NICU. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the existence of high clonal transmission of ESBLE in a Moroccan NICU. This finding provides useful information to implement a screening policy for resistant Enterobacteriaceae among neonates hospitalised in this ward.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The preterm microbiome is crucial to gut health and may contribute to necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), which represents the most significant pathology affecting preterm infants. From a cohort of 318 infants, <32 weeks gestation, we selected 7 infants who developed NEC (defined rigorously) and 28 matched controls. We performed detailed temporal bacterial (n = 641) and metabolomic (n = 75) profiling of the gut microbiome throughout the disease. RESULTS: A core community of Klebsiella, Escherichia, Staphyloccocus, and Enterococcus was present in all samples. Gut microbiota profiles grouped into six distinct clusters, termed preterm gut community types (PGCTs). Each PGCT reflected dominance by the core operational taxonomic units (OTUs), except of PGCT 6, which had high diversity and was dominant in bifidobacteria. While PGCTs 1-5 were present in infants prior to NEC diagnosis, PGCT 6 was comprised exclusively of healthy samples. NEC infants had significantly more PGCT transitions prior to diagnosis. Metabolomic profiling identified significant pathways associated with NEC onset, with metabolites involved in linoleate metabolism significantly associated with NEC diagnosis. Notably, metabolites associated with NEC were the lowest in PGCT 6. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to integrate sequence and metabolomic stool analysis in preterm neonates, demonstrating that NEC does not have a uniform microbial signature. However, a diverse gut microbiome with a high abundance of bifidobacteria may protect preterm infants from disease. These results may inform biomarker development and improve understanding of gut-mediated mechanisms of NEC.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency, viral load and molecular profile of NoV in fecal and nasopharyngeal swab samples from hospitalized children, and to determine children's secretor status. STUDY DESIGN: From May 2014 to May 2015, 219 children were included in the study, 96 with gastroenteric symptoms and 123 without gastroenteric symptoms. All fecal and nasopharyngeal swab samples were screened by TaqMan RT-qPCR duplex (GI/GII NoV) and quality samples were characterized by genomic sequencing. RESULTS: Norovirus positivity rate in feces was 15.4% in asymptomatic and 18.8% in the symptomatic group. The median viral loads in feces were 2.69x10(8)GC/g and 4.32x10(7)GC/g from children with or without AGE symptoms, respectively. In nasopharyngeal swab samples, the NoV positivity was 11.4% in symptomatic children, with a median viral load of 2.20x10(7)GC/mL and 6.5% in asymptomatic children, with an average viral load of 1.73x10(6)GC/mL. In only two cases NoV was detected in both samples. A considerable genomic variability was observed in feces, with six genotypes being detected, as follows: GII.4, GII.6, GI.3 and GII.3, GI.2 and GI.5. Two GI.3 was detected in nasopharyngeal swab. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal considerable NoV frequencies in both nasopharyngeal and fecal samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic children. Higher viral loads were detected in samples from AGE symptomatic children, when compared to asymptomatic children. High genomic variability was observed, with this being the first report of GI.5 NoV in Brazil and of GI.3 in nasopharyngeal swab samples.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of moderate to severe childhood diarrhea in resource-poor settings. Understanding the natural history of cryptosporidiosis and the correlates of protection are essential to develop effective and sustainable approaches to disease control and prevention. METHODS: Children (N = 497) were recruited at birth in semiurban slums in Vellore, India, and followed for 3 years with twice-weekly home visits. Stool samples were collected every 2 weeks and during diarrheal episodes were tested for Cryptosporidium species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum samples obtained every 6 months were evaluated for seroconversion, defined as a 4-fold increase in immunoglobulin G directed against Cryptosporidium gp15 and/or Cp23 antigens between consecutive sera. RESULTS: Of 410 children completing follow-up, 397 (97%) acquired cryptosporidiosis by 3 years of age. PCR identified 1053 episodes of cryptosporidiosis, with an overall incidence of 0.86 infections per child-year by stool and serology. The median age for the first infection was 9 (interquartile range, 4-17) months, indicating early exposure. Although infections were mainly asymptomatic (693 [66%]), Cryptosporidium was identified in 9.4% of diarrheal episodes. The proportion of reinfected children was high (81%) and there was clustering of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections (P < .0001 for both). Protection against infection increased with the order of infection but was only 69% after 4 infections. Cryptosporidium hominis (73.3%) was the predominant Cryptosporidium species, and there was no species-specific protection. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high burden of endemic cryptosporidiosis in southern India. Clustering of infection is suggestive of host susceptibility. Multiple reinfections conferred some protection against subsequent infection.",

			"abstract": "It has long been assumed that establishment of the fetal microbiome commences with the birthing process. However, recent studies have found bacterial DNA in umbilical cord blood, placenta, amniotic fluid, meconium, and fetal membranes in healthy normal pregnancies, leading to suggestions that the seeding of the fetal microbiome may commence in utero long before delivery. The origins of the microbiota of the fetal gastrointestinal (GI) tract have not yet been conclusively determined, although bacterial translocation from the maternal circulation, or ascension from the vagina, are both likely to be contributing pathways. Mother-to-child efflux of bacteria during pregnancy has the potential to markedly influence postnatal health, as the composition of gut microbiota determines production of important metabolites which are absorbed systemically and which modify immune function and development. Hence, the importance of understanding the colonization of the fetal GI microbiome is becoming clear, although few studies have investigated the origins, dynamics, and timing of the fetal microbiome. This is the topic of this review. By gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underpinning fetal microbiome seeding, strategies may be developed to optimize fetal immune development and reduce the risk of adverse health and developmental outcomes.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of infantile colic is poorly understood, though various studies report gut microbiota dysbiosis in colicky infants. We aimed to test the hypothesis that colic-related dysbiosis is associated with visceral hypersensitivity triggered by an altered luminal milieu. METHODS: Fecal samples from seven colicky and seven non-colicky infants were studied. Fecal supernatants (FS) were infused into the colons of C57/Bl6 mice (n=10/specimen). Visceral sensitivity was subsequently assessed in the animals by recording their abdominal muscle response to colorectal distension (CRD) by electromyography (EMG). Serine and cysteine protease activities were assessed in FS with specific substrates. Infant fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. KEY RESULTS: FS from colicky infants triggered higher EMG activity than FS from non-colicky infants in response to both the largest CRD volumes and overall, as assessed by the area under the curve of the EMG across all CRD volumes. Infant crying time strongly correlated with mouse EMG activity. Microbiota richness and phylogenetic diversity were increased in the colicky group, without showing prominent microbial composition alterations. Only Bacteroides vulgatus and Bilophila wadsworthia were increased in the colicky group. Bacteroides vulgatus abundance positively correlated with visceral sensitivity. No differences were found in protease activities. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Luminal contents from colicky infants trigger visceral hypersensitivity, which may explain the excessive crying behavior of these infants. Additional studies are required to determine the nature of the compounds involved, their mechanism of action, and the potential implications of intestinal microbiota in their generation.",

The interruption of the indigenous poliovirus transmission was obtained through mass immunization campaigns to eligible children and an active epidemiological and laboratorial surveillance of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children under 15 y of age. This paper describes and evaluates the performance of the AFP surveillance system in different geographic areas of Brazil between 2005 and 2014, using indicators recommended by WHO. AFP surveillance indicators as well as virological investigation of polio and non-polio enteroviruses in stool samples received in the laboratory were assessed from 2005-2014. During the period, 5463 cases of AFP were investigated. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. Those under 5 y of age represented 48% of all cases reported and investigated. AFP notification rate was within the acceptable values with mean value of 1.3 (North), 1.4 (Northeast), 1.1 (Southern), 1.0 (Southeast) and 1.4 (Midwest) cases of AFP per 100.000 population aged 15 y as well as the adequacy of fecal specimens received in the laboratory. Sabin- related polioviruses accounted for 1.7% of the isolates while, 6.7% were non-polio enterovirus with the values ranging from 5.0% to 8.9 %. No wild-type polio was found. The AFP epidemiological and laboratorial surveillance activities have been kept at appropriate levels in Brazil.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotyping of isolates were performed. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, whereas 24% of isolates were resistant to tetracycline; of the latter, 89% were also coresistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to erythromycin and gentamicin was infrequent (</= 0.7%). Antibiotic-resistant strains were generally not associated with the need for hospitalization. However, the prevalence of coresistant strains increased sharply after 2010, and these coresistant strains were more prevalent in infections caused by clonal PFGE types, with distinct patterns of temporal occurrence and age distribution in infected patients. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of coresistant Tc(R)/Cip(R) C. jejuni strains were detected in patients in Croatia. Strains were significantly associated with several clonal-type PFGE genotypes, shared common patterns of temporal occurrence, and showed distinct age distribution in infected patients, suggestive of newly identified strains. Since a high prevalence of coresistant Tc(R)/Cip(R) strains was also observed in other countries, further in-depth studies are essential to evaluate whether this phenomenon is linked to C. jejuni epidemiology in food animals and agricultural ecosystems.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare detection rates of newborn drug exposure at an academic medical center transitioning from meconium to umbilical cord tissue toxicology testing. METHODS: We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective chart review on all newborns (n=2072) for whom newborn drug testing was ordered at our academic medical center between June 2012 and August 2015 (in August 2013, umbilical cord tissue became the preferred specimen). RESULTS: Meconium toxicology testing was positive for at least one compound in 221 cases (21.3% of 1037 total specimens), with non-medical drug use identified in 85 cases (8.2%). Umbilical cord tissue toxicology testing was positive for at least one compound in 302 cases (29.2%), with non-medical drug use identified in 107 cases (10.3%). Of the cases involving non-medical drug use, the most common compounds detected were tetrahydrocannabinol and amphetamines. Non-medical drug use did not differ significantly between meconium and umbilical cord tissue, either as a total or for classes of drugs such as amphetamines, cannabinoids, and opiates. Maternal non-medical use of tramadol (not tested for in meconium) was identified in 5 cases (0.4%). There were significant differences in rate of detection of iatrogenic medications. Specifically, morphine, lorazepam, phenobarbital, and codeine were more commonly detected in meconium, while oxycodone was more commonly detected in umbilical cord tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical cord tissue toxicology testing yielded a similar detection rate compared to meconium testing. The use of umbilical cord tissue avoids detection of medications given to the neonate prior to meconium collection.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Standardized practices for the management of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are associated with shorter lengths of stay, but optimal protocols are not established. We sought to identify practice variations for newborns with in utero chronic opioid exposure among hospitals in the Better Outcomes Through Research for Newborns (BORN) network. METHODS: Nursery site leaders completed a survey about hospitals' policies and practices regarding care for infants with chronic opioid exposure (>/=3 weeks). RESULTS: The 76 (80%) of 95 respondent hospitals were in 34 states, varied in size (<500 to >8000 births and <10 to >200 opioid-exposed infants per year), with most affiliated with academic centers (89%). Most (80%) had protocols for newborn drug exposure screening; 90% used risk-based approaches. Specimens included urine (85%), meconium (76%), and umbilical cords (10%). Of sites (88%) with NAS management protocols, 77% addressed medical management, 72% nursing care, 72% pharmacologic treatment, and 58% supportive care. Morphine was the most common first-line pharmacotherapy followed by methadone. Observation periods for opioid-exposed newborns varied; 57% observed short-acting opioid exposure for 2 to 3 days, while 30% observed for >/=5 days. For long-acting opioids, 71% observed for 4 to 5 days, 19% for 2 to 3 days, and 8% for >/=7 days. Observation for NAS occurred mostly in level 1 nurseries (86%); however, most (87%) transferred to NICUs when pharmacologic treatment was indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Most BORN hospitals had protocols for the care of opioid-exposed infants, but policies varied widely and characterized areas of needed research. Identification of variation is the first step toward establishing best practice standards to improve care for this rapidly growing population.",

Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalized newborns were sampled for ESBL presence by stool cultures on the first and fourth days of life. Mothers of ESBL-positive newborns were sampled for possible correlation detection. Bacteria isolates were molecularly identified and susceptibility tests for antibiotic agents were performed. Of the 225 newborns, 14 (6.2%) were ESBL positive, 10 (4.4%) were Escherichia coli positive, and 4 (1.7%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae positive. Among the 14 mothers of positive newborns, 13 (92.8%) were found ESBL positive and one mother of a newborn with E. coli carriage was found ESBL negative. Genes encoding for ESBL resistance were identified. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance were tested. This study demonstrated that ESBL bacteria carrier neonates hospitalized in NICU may be a result of transmission from mother to baby during delivery.",

			"abstract": "In this study, the stability of 21 cocaine, opioid and benzodiazepine analytes in spiked meconium was investigated at three storage temperatures: 4 degrees C, room temperature (RT), and 37 degrees C (body temperature). The drugs/metabolites included were hydrocodone, hydromorphone, codeine, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM), oxycodone, oxymorphone, cocaine, cocaethylene, benzoylecgonine, m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine, diazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, nordiazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, clonazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, midazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam and zolpidem. Drug testing was performed using mass spectrometry methods that were validated for clinical use. After 2 weeks of storage, a substantial loss was observed in the concentrations of 7-aminoclonazepam (48.4% at 4 degrees C and 71.5% at RT), and chlordiazepoxide (59.5% at RT). A slight decrease was observed in the concentrations of alprazolam (20.9% at 4 degrees C), clonazepam (24.5% at 4 degrees C), chlordiazepoxide (23.5% at 4 degrees C), midazolam (20.8% at 4 degrees C), nordiazepam (22.8% at RT), and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (20.7% at 4 degrees C). At 37 degrees C, the concentrations of chlordiazepoxide, 7-aminoclonazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, nordiazepam and temazepam decreased by 81.4%, 86.8%, 56.5%, 59.9%, 45.4% and 31.7%, respectively, after 2 weeks. 6-AM was observed to be unstable regardless of storage temperatures. For morphine, a 33.3% increase at 4 degrees C and a 23.4% increase at RT were observed after 2 weeks, respectively, possibly due to 6-AM degradation, while no changes >/=20% were observed at 37 degrees C. All other analytes were stable up to 2 weeks at all three storage temperatures (concentration changes <20%). The stability of select drug analytes in authentic clinical meconium specimens was consistent with that observed in spiked meconium. In conclusion, some drugs in meconium may not be stable for long periods of time. Sample storage conditions are an important consideration in the context of detection windows and interpreting drug-testing results in meconium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stability study of cocaine, opioids and benzodiazepines in meconium concerning the effects of storage temperatures.",

			"article_name": "Arsenic levels among pregnant women and newborns in Canada: Results from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) cohort.",
			"abstract": "Arsenic is a common environmental contaminant from both naturally-occurring and anthropomorphic sources and human exposure can be detected in various tissues. Its toxicity depends on many factors including the chemical form, valence state, bioavailability, metabolism and detoxification within the human body. Of paramount concern, particularly with respect to health effects in children, is the timing of exposure as the prenatal and early life periods are more susceptible to toxic effects. The Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) cohort was established to obtain national-level biomonitoring data for approximately 2,000 pregnant women and their infants between 2008 and 2011 from 10 Canadian cities. We measured total arsenic (As) in 1st and 3rd trimester maternal blood, umbilical cord blood, and infant meconium and speciated arsenic in 1st trimester maternal urine. Most pregnant women had detectable levels of total arsenic in blood (92.5% and 87.3%, respectively, for 1st and 3rd trimester); median difference between 1st and 3rd trimester was 0.1124microg/L (p<0.0001), but paired samples were moderately correlated (Spearman r=0.41, p<0.0001). Most samples were below the LOD for umbilical cord blood (50.9%) and meconium (93.9%). In 1st trimester urine samples, a high percentage (>50%) of arsenic species (arsenous acid (As-III), arsenic acid (As-V), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and arsenobetaine (AsB)) were also below the limit of detection, except dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). DMA (>85% detected) ranged from <LOD to 64.42 (95th percentile: 11.99)microgAs/L. There was a weak but significant correlation between total arsenic in blood and specific gravity-adjusted DMA in urine (Spearman r=0.33, p<0.0001). Among this population of pregnant woman and newborns, levels of arsenic measured in blood and urine were lower than national population figures for Canadian women of reproductive age (20-39 years). In general, higher arsenic levels were observed in women who were older, foreign-born (predominantly from Asian countries), and had higher education. Further research is needed to elucidate sources of exposure and factors that may influence arsenic exposure in pregnant women and children.",

The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of meconium as a novel matrix to quantify prenatal steroid levels. We quantified parameters of analytical interest regarding the use of meconium, including sample stability. We hypothesized that meconium steroid content would differ by sex, prompting analysis of meconium to test effects of prenatal steroid metabolism. Meconium from 193 newborns enrolled in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) study, including 107 males, and 86 females, were analyzed by isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (ID-LC-HRMS) while blinded to identity for testosterone (T), androstenedione (AD), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Steroid levels were compared by sex, and investigations of potential trends resulting from sample storage or processing was conducted. The unconjugated steroid content of meconium in ng/g (mean, standard deviation) was for males: T (2.67, 8.99), AD (20.01, 28.12), DHEA (13.96, 23.57) and for females: T (0.82, 1.63), AD (22.32, 24.38), DHEA (21.06, 43.49). T was higher in meconium from males (p=0.0333), and DHEA was higher in meconium from females (p=0.0202). 6 female and 3 male T values were below the limit of detection. No extreme variability in hydration or trend in steroid levels by storage time was detected. Sexually dimorphic levels of hormones may reflect gestational differentiation, and future studies should consider meconium analysis.",

Robust studies linking outcomes with specific indications for operation are lacking. Promising biomarkers for severe NEC include fecal calprotectin and S100A12; serum fatty acid-binding protein; and urine biomarkers. Recent advances in ultrasonography make this imaging modality more useful in identifying surgical NEC and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is being actively studied. Another fairly recent finding is that regionalization of care for infants with NEC likely improves outcomes. The neurodevelopmental outcomes after surgical treatment are known to be poor.

The data also mostly come from western countries and little information is available for the Middle East. Here, we determined the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microbiota during the first month of life for PTI (n = 66) and FTI (n = 17) in Lebanon. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed by quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). We observed differences in the establishment and composition of the intestinal microbiota between the two groups. q-PCR showed that PTI were more highly colonized by Staphylococcus than FTI in the first three weeks of life; whereas FTI were more highly colonized by Clostridium clusters I and XI. At one month of life, PTI were mainly colonized by facultative anaerobes and a few strict anaerobes, such as Clostridium cluster I and Bifidobacterium. The type of feeding and antibiotic treatments significantly affected intestinal colonization. TTGE revealed low species diversity in both groups and high inter-individual variability in PTI. Our findings show that PTI had altered intestinal colonization with a higher occurrence of potential pathogens (Enterobacter, Clostridium sp) than FTI. This suggests the need for intervention strategies for PTI to modulate their intestinal microbiota and promote their health.",

Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are elevated in meconium of alcohol-exposed term newborns. We hypothesized that meconium FAEEs would be similarly elevated in alcohol-exposed VLBW premature newborns. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of 64 VLBW neonates, newborns were classified into Non-Exposed, Any Exposure, or Weekly Exposure groups based on an in-depth structured maternal interview. Meconium FAEE concentrations were quantified via gas chromatography mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Alcohol exposure during Trimester 1 (Any Exposure) occurred in ~30% of the pregnancies, while 11% of the subjects reported drinking >/= 1 drink/week (Weekly Exposure). Meconium ethyl linolenate was higher in Any Exposure (P = 0.01) and Weekly Exposure groups (P = 0.005) compared to the Non-Exposed VLBW group. There was a significant positive correlation between Trimester 1 drinking amounts and the concentration of meconium ethyl linolenate (P = 0.005). Adjusted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves evaluating ethyl linolenate to identify alcohol-exposed VLBW newborns generated areas under the curve of 88% with sensitivities of 86-89% and specificities of 83-88%.

This retrospective observational study assessed, in a UK setting, the impact of the vaccination programme on the number of RV gastroenteritis (RVGE) admissions, the complications of RVGE in hospitalised children, and the impact on hospital-acquired RVGE. DESIGN: Over a 3 year period, 1-year before and 2 years after the introduction of the vaccine, children under 13 years of age in Lothian region with RV+ve stool sample by PCR were identified, retrospectively, and admission data (length of stay, complications) and vaccination status analysed. Viral strain (vaccine/wild type) was typed using PCR-based methods in vaccinated children. RESULTS: Vaccination uptake in the first 2 years of the programme was 93-94%. In the 2 years following vaccine introduction, the annual number of confirmed RVGE admissions fell by 84.7% (95% CI 75.4 to 91.0), from 131 to 20, bed days reduced by 91.1% (86.9 to 94.1), from 325 to 29, and suspected hospital-acquired infections reduced by 95.7% (73.5-99.5), from 23 to 1. The reduction in admissions was seen across all age groups despite the vaccination only being administered to infants. Despite the reduction in incidence, complication rates in children admitted with RVGE remained unchanged across the three study years. A frequent incidental finding was RV vaccine strain in the stools of vaccinated children, up to 43 days after last immunisation. There has been no concurrent increase in rate of intussusception in the region. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide encouraging initial evidence of the public health benefit, including to the unimmunised population, of the RV vaccination programme in the UK.",

Fecal samples (n = 418) collected from children (age </=5 years) hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis, between January 2009 and December 2011, from three local hospitals were examined for presence of HBoV using PCR targeting the partial VP1/VP2 capsid region ( approximately 575 bp) followed by phylogenetic analysis. HBoV was detected in 24/418 (5.7%) cases. Co-infection was observed in 5/24 (21%) cases. HBoV infections occurred in children </=12 months of age. Peak HBoV activity was observed in monsoon and post monsoon season. All four HBoV genotypes were detected in the study region. Major clinical symptoms of HBoV mono infections included diarrhoea (100%), fever (90%), dehydration (74%), and vomiting (58%). Dehydration was observed in all of the HBoV2-4 cases and in 50% of the HBoV1 cases. Clinical severity varied with genotype (HBoV2 > HBoV1 > HBoV3 > HBoV4). HBoV2 cases recorded severe and very severe infections. The study illustrates prevalence and vast genetic diversity of HBoVs in acute gastroenteritis. It highlights the clinical features of HBoV1-4 infections and sheds light on clinical impact of HBoV genotypes in gastroenteritis. J. Med. Virol. 89:17-23, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

			"abstract": "A total of 1034 samples were collected from different sources and C. difficile was isolated from 18 (9.04%) of 199 human, 9 (4.89%) of 184 cattle, 29 (12.44%) of 233 pig, and from 23 (13.94%) of 165 poultry samples. Variations were observed on the rate of isolation according to age and clinical conditions (diarrhoea). None of the samples from cow, sheep, goat, local chicken, and wild animals yielded any C. difficile. Out of those isolates, 8, 2, 19 and 6 isolates from human, cattle, pig and poultry, respectively were toxigenic. The toxigenic isolates carried both tcdA, and tcdB (A(+)B(+)) and most of the human and the pig isolates were also positive for binary toxin genes (cdtA and cdtB). The A(+)B(+) isolates belonged to three different toxinotypes (0, VI and XXXIII). Human and pig A(+)B(+) isolates belonged to three (045, 126 and ACD 019) and four (046, 087, 126 and ACD 011) different ribotypes, respectively and the ribotypes of two cattle isolates were 014 and ACD 010. Six A(+)B(+) avian isolates belonged to six different ribotypes (014, 087, SLO 134, SLO 160, ACD 012, ACD 014). The non-toxigenic isolates from human, cattle, pig and poultry were grouped into 7, 4, 4 and 7 different ribotypes, respectively. PFGE analysis could not differentiate similar ribotypes/toxinotypes of toxigenic isolates. All the toxigenic isolates showed cytopathic effect on Vero and Hela cell monolayers at 1:100 dilutions of cell-free culture supernatants within 18-20 h of inoculation.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human enteroviruses (HEVs) and rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been linked to acute otitis media (AOM). OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluates the aforementioned association in a birth cohort setting. STUDY DESIGN: The cohort included 286 healthy infants (191 boys) followed from birth up to the age of 2 years in the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study in Finland. Stool samples were collected monthly and analyzed for the presence of HRV and HEV RNA using RT-PCR. Clinical symptoms were recorded by a questionnaire every 3-6 months. RESULTS: Altogether 610 AOM episodes were reported during the follow-up. 9.8% of the stool samples were positive for HRV and 6.8% for HEV. HRV positivity peaked at the age of 3-6 months declining gradually after this age, whereas HEV positivity peaked later, at the age of 12-24 months. The risk of AOM was increased in children who were HEV positive at least once at the age of 6-12 months (OR 2.2 [95%CI 1.1-4.2], P=0.023) or who were HRV positive at least once at the age of 18-24 months (OR 2.3 [95%CI 1.0-5.2], P=0.042). Having an older sibling, short breast-feeding and maternal smoking during pregnancy were also significantly associated with AOM. CONCLUSIONS: HRV and HEV infections are frequent during the first months of life. The observed trend for increased risk of AOM in HRV and HEV positive children is in line with the results from hospital series suggesting that these viruses may play an independent role in the pathogenesis of AOM.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists about the sustainability of the reduction in rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) following the introduction of rotavirus vaccines into national immunization programs, and on its potential impact on circulating genotypes. RotaTeq was introduced into the Israeli national immunization program in December 2010, and vaccination coverage is around 80%. AIMS: To examine the change in incidence of RVGE hospitalization and rotavirus genotypes, during the five years after introduction of RotaTeq into the Israeli national immunization program. METHODS: Data were obtained prospectively on hospitalization of children aged 0-59months due to acute gastroenteritis (N=7346) from three hospitals in northern Israel. Stool samples were tested for rotavirus by immunochromatography. Rotavirus was genotyped (N=506) by RT-PCR and/or sequencing. RESULTS: The average incidence of RVGE hospitalization declined by 61.0% (95% CI 49.0-73.4%), from 5.6 per 1000 (95% CI 5.0-6.2) in the pre-universal immunization period (2008-2010) to 2.2 per 1000 (95% CI 1.8-2.5) during the universal immunization period (2012-2015), but yearly fluctuations were still observed. The most common genotypes in the pre-universal immunization period were G1P[8] (35.3%) followed by G2P[4] (15.5%), G3P[8] (8.8%), G4P[8] (4.3%) and G9P[8] (4.3%), and 19.5% were mixed infections. The dominance of G1P[8] continued into the universal immunization period (48.6%), followed by G3P[8] (21.5%), G9P[8] (15.9%) and G12P[8] (4.7%), while mixed rotavirus infections were no longer detected. CONCLUSIONS: Universal immunization with RotaTeq in Israel was associated a sustained reduction in RVGE hospitalization. It is unclear whether changes in the circulating rotavirus genotypes are due to vaccine-induced selective pressure. Assessment of the long-term impact of rotavirus vaccination on the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis and continued strain surveillance is warranted.",

AIM: To describe the frequency, demography, clinical features and outcome of nosocomial CDAD in children admitted to Assiut University Children's Hospital, Egypt. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 72 children developed nosocomial diarrhoea between April 2010 and March 2011. A medical history, clinical assessment and culture for Clostridium difficile and direct toxin detection from stool samples by enzyme immuno-assay were undertaken in all patients. RESULTS: CDAD was diagnosed in 17 (23.6%) patients. Those aged </=12 months were the most commonly affected (eight, 47%). The main cause of admission was respiratory disorders (eight, 47% of cases), followed by surgical problems (three, 17.7%). Ten patients (58.8%) had severe symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the demographic or laboratory data for children with CDAD and children with other causes of nosocomial diarrhoea. None of the patients developed complications. Seven children with CDAD (41.2%) had recurrence. CONCLUSION: CDAD is an important cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in children in Assiut University Children's Hospital. Established guidelines should be followed in all hospitals to minimise exposure to the pathogen. Physicians can do much to reduce the risk of a severe outcome in children by early identification and rapid management. Further research should be undertaken to identify the risk factors for recurrence.",

We tested stool samples from 176 hospitalized patients with diarrhoea and from 131 asymptomatic non-hospitalized individuals for C. difficile and some other enteric pathogens. The overall prevalence rate of C. difficile was 4.9% with ribotype 084 being predominant. With 75% of the isolates, a high rate of nontoxigenic strains was present in symptomatic patients, most of whom had no other identified enteric pathogens. All strains were susceptible against metronidazole and vancomycin, respectively. Data on lifestyle and medical history showed that age <5years (p=0.004), and use of ceftriaxone (p=0.023) were the most important risk factors for C. difficile carriage status. Although our data suggest that C. difficile is currently not a major cause of diarrhoea in this setting, the epidemiology of C. difficile in sub-Saharan Africa awaits further investigation.",

Stools from 40 BA patients and 40 in-hospital neonates with pneumonia were photographed and analyzed with color-analyzing mobile applications. RESULTS: Saturations of normal colors in the published stool cards were all >50% (67%~99%, median 85%) and were all <50% (7~47%, median 25%) for abnormal colors. With saturation<60% as a cutoff line, acholic stools could be identified with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 85%.

The presence of enteric RNA viruses, specifically norovirus (NoV) GI, GII, GIII, GIV; sapovirus (SaV); rotavirus (RV); and astrovirus (AstV), was evaluated in stools from diarrheic (n = 2281) and non-diarrheic (n = 173) people over a 1-year period in 2008 and 2009. Diarrheic individuals lived in rural (46.6 %) and urban (53.4 %) settings and ranged in age from less than 1 month to 102 years, and the highest prevalence of infection in these individuals was in November. In all, viruses were detected in diarrheic stools from 388 individuals (17.0 %). NoV GII was the most frequently detected virus (8.0 %; n = 182) followed by SaV (4.3 %; n = 97), RV (2.0 %; n = 46), AstV (1.8 %; n = 42), NoV GI (0.9 %; n = 20), and NoV GIV (0.1 %; n = 1). Animal NoV GIII was never detected. The prevalence of mixed viral infections in diarrheic individuals was 2.8 % (n = 11). Children from 1 to 5 years of age accounted for the highest prevalence of positive stools, followed by the elderly individuals (>/=70 years). Only NoV GII (1.2 %; n = 2) and SaV (1.2 %; n = 2) were detected in stools from non-diarrheic people. Sequence analysis of a subset of stools revealed homology to NoV, SaV and RV sequences from humans but not to strains from non-human animals. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that viruses of animal origin have a significant impact on the occurrence of acute gastroenteritis caused by RNA enteric viruses in people living in southwestern Alberta.",

Although RV is routinely isolated from the respiratory tract, few studies have examined RV in other types of clinical samples. The prevalence of RV was examined in 1,294 stool samples collected mostly from children with acute gastroenteritis residing in Bangkok and Khon Kaen province of Thailand between January 2010 and October 2014. In addition, 591 samples from hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) or herpangina patients who do not have gastroenteritis served as a comparison group. Samples were initially screened by semi-nested PCR for the RV 5'UTR through the VP2 capsid region. RV genotyping and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the VP4/VP2 regions. Among children with acute gastroenteritis, RV was found in 2.3% (30/1,294) of stool samples, which comprised 47% (14/30) RV-A, 17% (5/30) RV-B, and 37% (11/30) RV-C. In the comparison group, 0.8% (5/591) was RV-positive and RV-C (3/5) was the major species found. Interestingly, RV was recovered more often from children with acute gastroenteritis than from those with HFMD or herpangina. As many as 31 RV types were present in the gastroenteritis stools, which were different than the types found in those with HFMD or herpangina. J. Med. Virol. 89:801-808, 2017.

The bifidobacteria isolates were identified using 16s rDNA sequencing as Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. breve, B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum. These isolates were further investigated for their ability to produce CLNA using linolenic acid as substrate via GC-MS. The results showed most of the isolates could convert free linolenic acid into c9,t11,c15-CLNA and t9,t11,c15-CLNA at different levels. B. pseudocatenulatum was the most effective CLNA producer, which converted 86.91% of linolenic acid to c9,t11,c15-CLNA and 3.59% of to t9,t11,c15-CLNA isomer and the isolate exhibited to accumulate CLNA during 72 h culturing in which most CLNA isomers were in the supernatant fluid.

A total of 34 stool specimens were obtained from preterm infants upon admission and once weekly up to two weeks during hospitalization. The presumptive colonies of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were selected for identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and subtyping by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

Three colistin resistant K. pneumoniae have also been detected based on E-test analysis. Thirty-nine isolates of K. pneumoniae and 20 isolates of E. coli were resistant to more than three antimicrobial classes and were categorized as multidrug resistant (MDR).

In addition, a total of fifteen pulsotypes was observed from 39 MDR K. pneumoniae. The risk factors for antibiotic resistance were assessed using random forest analysis. Gender was found to be the most important predictor for colistin resistant while length, OFC, and delivery mode were showing greater predictive power in the polymyxin B resistance.

The specimens were screened for group A rotavirus (RVA) using ELISA, and RVA-positive specimens were subjected to semi-nested RT-PCR to determine the G and P genotypes. RVA was detected in 429/1,546 (27.5%) fecal specimens. RVA infections occurred in all age groups <59 months, with an early peak at 6-17 months. The infections persisted year-round with distinct seasonal peaks depending on the year.

As lung epithelial cells up-regulate nitric oxide (NO) in response to inflammation, the NO production following meconium exposition was examined in relation to expression of Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors 1 (DMBT1), a protein with functions in innate immunity and inflammatory regulation. Here, DMBT1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in postmortem lung sections from patients with MAS. The lung epithelial cell line A549, stably transfected with a DMBT1 (DMBT1+ cells) expression plasmid or with an empty expression plasmid (DMBT1- cells), was exposed to meconium. NO was determined in dependence of aminoguanidine (inducible NO synthase inhibitor), steroids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). DMBT1 is highly expressed in lungs with MAS. In the absence of meconium, DMBT1+ cells showed a higher NO production than the DMBT1- cells (p = 0.0090). Meconium led in DMBT1- and DMBT1+ cells to elevated NO levels (p < 0.0001), but with a higher NO level in DMBT1+ cells (p < 0.0001). Aminoguanidine, an iNOS inhibitor, reduced the higher NO production in DMBT1+ cells (p = 0.0476), but NO levels remained above NO production from DMBT1- cells (p = 0.0289). Dexamethasone diminished NO production in DMBT1+ cells after meconium exposition (p = 0.0076). Combined addition of LPS and meconium significantly increased NO production in both cell types (p < 0.0001). In comparison to exposure with only meconium, the combined addition of LPS and meconium to the cells increased NO levels in both DMBT1- cells (p = 0.0030) and DMBT1+ cells (p = 0.0028). In conclusion, basal and meconium-induced NO production in lung epithelial cells is positively regulated by DMBT1.",

Using stool samples (n = 298; aged 1-11 months) from a US birth cohort and 16S rRNA sequencing, neonates (median age, 35 d) were divisible into three microbiota composition states (NGM1-3). Each incurred a substantially different RR for multisensitized atopy at age 2 years and doctor-diagnosed asthma at age 4 years. The highest risk group, labeled NGM3, showed lower relative abundance of certain bacteria (for example, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium), higher relative abundance of particular fungi (Candida and Rhodotorula) and a distinct fecal metabolome enriched for pro-inflammatory metabolites. Ex vivo culture of human adult peripheral T cells with sterile fecal water from NGM3 subjects increased the proportion of CD4(+) cells producing interleukin (IL)-4 and reduced the relative abundance of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cells. 12,13-DiHOME, enriched in NGM3 versus lower-risk NGM states, recapitulated the effect of NGM3 fecal water on relative CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cell abundance.

The overall incidence of rotavirus (2%) is reduced compared to pre-vaccination studies; however the incidence of other GI viruses has not increased. Norovirus infections had a significantly higher virus burden compared to other GI viruses (P </=0.03); sapovirus infections had the lowest viral burden. The number of norovirus cases per month did not follow the typical winter seasonal trend of nationally reported outbreaks. The number of cases per month correlates with the number of hospital admissions (R=0.703, P=0.011); the number of admissions accounts for 50% of the variability in number of cases per month. The breadth of genotypes seen (48% non-GII.4), suggests a community source for many norovirus infections and has implications for vaccine development. All GI viruses caused chronic infections, with the majority (50-100%) in immunocompromised patients. Incidence or duration of infection in chronic norovirus infections did not differ between genotypes, suggesting host-mediated susceptibility.",

			"abstract": "Sapoviruses (SaVs) are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Despite this, few studies in India have focused on the epidemiological investigation of SaV in cases of acute gastroenteritis. The aim of this study was to understand the molecular epidemiology, genetic diversity and clinical impact of SaV in diarrhoeic children from Pune, Western India. Between 2007 and 2011, a total of 985 faecal samples from diarrhoeic cases and non-diarrhoeic controls were collected and examined for the presence of SaV by nested RT-PCR. SaV was detected in 2.7% (21/778) of the cases and 1.9% (4/207) of the controls. We observed that the majority of SaV mono-infections caused severe gastroenteritis (67%) with clinical manifestations of diarrhoea (100%), vomiting (73%) and dehydration (80%). All known human SaV genogroups were detected in the study. At least eight genotypes were identified from cases and controls. Genogroups GIV and GV, along with genotypes GI.5, GII.4 and GII.6, were discovered for the first time in India. Two GII.4 study strains were found to be 98.5-99% identical, having a novel intra-genogroup recombinant (GII.1/GII.4) recently reported from the Philippines, suggesting probable evidence of recombination. The circulation pattern of SaV genotypes varied during the study period, with GII.1 being predominant in 2007 and 2009, GIV.1 in 2008, and GV.1 in 2011.",

			"abstract": "Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a life-threatening complication of Hirschsprung's disease (HD). Although the pathological mechanisms are still unclear, studies have shown that HAEC has a close relationship with the disturbance of intestinal microbiota. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the intestinal microbiome of HD patients with or without enterocolitis. During routine or emergency surgery, we collected 35 intestinal content samples from five patients with HAEC and eight HD patients, including three HD patients with a history of enterocolitis who were in a HAEC remission (HAEC-R) phase. Using Illumina-MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, we sequenced the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined by 97% sequence similarity. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of weighted UniFrac distances was performed to evaluate the diversity of each intestinal microbiome sample. The microbiota differed significantly between the HD patients (characterized by the prevalence of Bacteroidetes) and HAEC patients (characterized by the prevalence of Proteobacteria), while the microbiota of the HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of the HAEC patients. We also observed that the specimens from different intestinal sites of each HD patient differed significantly, while the specimens from different intestinal sites of each HAEC and HAEC-R patient were more similar. In conclusion, the microbiome pattern of the HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of the HAEC patients than to that of the HD patients. The HD patients had a relatively distinct, more stable community than the HAEC and HAEC-R patients, suggesting that enterocolitis may either be caused by or result in a disruption of the patient's uniquely adapted intestinal flora. The intestinal microbiota associated with enterocolitis may persist following symptom resolution and can be implicated in the symptom recurrence.",

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to describe the pathogens associated with diarrhoea, pneumonia and oropharyngeal colonization in children born to HIV-infected women (HIV-exposed infants). METHODS: The Mashi Study randomized 1200 HIV-infected women and their infants to breastfeed for 6 months with ZDV prophylaxis or formula-feed with 4 weeks of ZDV. Children were tested for HIV by PCR at 1, 4, 7, 9 and 12 months and by ELISA at 18 months. Pre-defined subsets of children were sampled during episodes of diarrhoea (n = 300) and pneumonia (n = 85). Stool was tested for bacterial pathogens, rotavirus and parasites. Children with pneumonia underwent bacterial blood culture, and testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates for viral pathogens by PCR. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from a consecutive subset of 561 infants at the routine 3-month visit for bacterial culture. RESULTS: The median age (range) at sampling was 181 days for diarrhoea (0-730) and 140 days for pneumonia (2-551). Pathogens were identified in 55 (18%) children with diarrhoea and 32 (38%) with pneumonia. No differences in pathogens by child HIV status (HIV-infected vs HIV-uninfected) or feeding strategy were identified. Campylobacter was the most common diarrhoeal pathogen (7%). Adenovirus (22%) and other viruses (19%) were the primary pathogens isolated during pneumonias. More formula-fed infants had oropharyngeal colonization by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria (16.8% vs 6.2%, P = 0.003), which was associated with a non-significant increased risk of pneumonia (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.8-5.7). CONCLUSION: A trend toward oropharyngeal bacterial colonization was observed in formula-fed infants. Although viruses were most commonly detected during pneumonia, respiratory colonization by Gram-negative bacteria may have contributed to pneumonia in formula-fed infants.",

Drug and metabolite determination in biological matrices from mother and newborn is an objective indication of prenatal drug exposure. However, limited data are available regarding the interpretation of these analytical results in terms of window of detection and degree of exposure. We collected paired maternal hair, meconium, placenta, and umbilical cord from 727 mother-newborn dyads. We analyzed these specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of cocaine, opioids, methadone, and amphetamines, and compared the analytical results from the four different matrices. The cases were divided in non-exposure, low, and frequent exposure, based on maternal hair concentrations and segmental analysis by trimesters. For cocaine, 62 cases tested positive in hair, 9 in meconium, 6 in placenta and 7 in umbilical cord. In the case of opioids, 14 maternal hair cases were positive, 11 meconium and umbilical cord and 9 placenta samples. For methadone, 11 cases were positive in hair, 9 in meconium and 6 in placenta and umbilical cord. For amphetamines, 18 cases were positive according to maternal hair, but all meconium, placenta, and umbilical cord tested negative. Maternal hair was the most sensitive specimen to detect drug exposure during pregnancy. Meconium, placenta, and umbilical cord tested positive if hair concentrations showed frequent drug use during the whole pregnancy, especially during the third trimester. Meconium, placenta, and umbilical cord also tested positive for morphine and metabolites, if this drug was administered during labour and delivery. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: An altered compositional signature and reduced diversity of early gut microbiota are linked to development of allergic disease. We investigated the relationship between dominant Bifidobacterium species during the early post-natal period and subsequent development of allergic disease in the first year of life. METHODS: Faecal samples were collected at age 1 week, 1 month and 3 months from 117 infants at high risk of allergic disease. Bifidobacterium species were analysed by quantitative PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Infants were examined at 3, 6 and 12 months, and skin prick test was performed at 12 months. Eczema was diagnosed according to the UK Working Party criteria. RESULTS: The presence of B. catenulatum at 3 months was associated with a higher risk of developing eczema (OR(adj) = 4.5; 95% CI: 1.56-13.05, p(adj) = 0.005). Infants colonized with B. breve at 1 week (OR(adj) = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.95, p(adj) = 0.04) and 3 months (OR(adj) = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.05-0.44, p(adj) = 0.00001) had a reduced risk of developing eczema. Furthermore, the presence of B. breve at 3 months was associated with a lower risk of atopic sensitization at 12 months (OR(adj) = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.15-0.98, p(adj) = 0.05). B. breve colonization patterns were influenced by maternal allergic status, household pets and number of siblings. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal variations in Bifidobacterium colonization patterns early in life are associated with later development of eczema and/or atopic sensitization in infants at high risk of allergic disease. Modulation of the early microbiota may provide a means to prevent eczema in high-risk infants.",

This study was initiated to estimate prevalence and types of HAdV among children below 5 years of age seeking health care facility for treatment of diarrhea in Kolkata, Eastern India. A total of 1,562 stool specimens were tested during 2013-2014 and among them, 185 (11.8%) were positive for enteric HAdV. Maximum number of positive cases were observed among children between 6 and 12 months of age (13.9%). HAdV infection occurred at a low frequency throughout the year, with an increased incidence in the month of March-July in both the years. Among HAdV positive samples (n = 185), 44.8% showed coinfection with rotavirus. Genotyping based on hypervariable region of hexon and partial shaft region of fiber genes, revealed prevalence of HAdV-40 over HAdV-41 genotype during this study period. Nucleotide sequence analysis of HAdV-40 strains exhibited more than 99% similarity among themselves and 98.5% with the prototype strain Dugan. Sequence analysis of six hypervariable regions (HVRs) of hexon genes from all the HAdV-41 strains revealed co-circulation of both genome type cluster 1(GTC1) and GTC2. The presence of both types of GTCs reflects accumulation of amino acid (aa) mutations in HVR of hexon gene. A recombination event was evident in a subset of HAdV-41 strains where hexon gene belonged to GTC1 whereas, fiber gene clustered with GTC2. Sequence analysis of fiber gene shaft region of HAdV-41 strains revealed 15 aa deletion from the 15th repeat motif. J. Med. Virol. 89:606-614, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Gut microbiota of 298 children from a Detroit-based birth cohort were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing: 130 neonates (median age = 1.2 months) and 168 infants (median age = 6.6 months). Multiple factors were associated with neonatal gut microbiome composition in both single- and multi-factor models, with independent contributions of maternal race-ethnicity, breastfeeding, mode of delivery, marital status, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and indoor pets. These findings were consistent in the infants, and networks demonstrating the shared impact of factors on gut microbial composition also showed notable topological similarity between neonates and infants. Further, latent groups defined by these factors explained additional variation, highlighting the importance of combinatorial effects. Our findings also have implications for studies investigating the impact of the early life gut microbiota on disease.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: An estimated 15,000 children and adolescents under the age of 19 years are diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma and other tumors in the USA every year. All children and adolescent acute leukemia patients will undergo chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen. Fortunately, survival rates for most pediatric cancers have improved at a remarkable pace over the past three decades, and the overall survival rate is greater than 90 % today. However, significant differences in survival rate have been found in different age groups (94 % in 1-9.99 years, 82 % in >/=10 years and 76 % in >/=15 years). ALL accounts for about three out of four cases of childhood leukemia. Intensive chemotherapy treatment coupled with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotic use could potentially have a long-term effect on the resident gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome. The composition of GI microbiome and its changes upon chemotherapy in pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients is poorly understood. In this study, using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences we profile the GI microbial communities of pediatric and adolescent acute leukemia patients before and after chemotherapy treatment and compare with the microbiota of their healthy siblings. RESULTS: Our study cohort consisted of 51 participants, made up of matched pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL and a healthy sibling. We elucidated and compared the GI microbiota profiles of patients and their healthy sibling controls via analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. We assessed the GI microbiota composition in pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL during the course of chemotherapy by comparing stool samples taken before chemotherapy with stool samples collected at varying time points during the chemotherapeutic treatment. The microbiota profiles of both patients and control sibling groups are dominated by members of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium. At the genus level, both groups share many taxa in common, but the microbiota diversity of the patient group is significantly lower than that of the control group. It was possible to distinguish between the patient and control groups based on their microbiota profiles. The top taxa include Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus2 with relatively higher abundance in the control group. The observed microbiota changes are likely the result of several factors including a direct influence of therapeutic compounds on the gut flora and an indirect effect of chemotherapy on the immune system, which, in turn, affects the microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides significant information on GI microbiota populations in immunocompromised children and opens up the potential for developing novel diagnostics based on stool tests and therapies to improve the dysbiotic condition of the microbiota at the time of diagnosis and in the earliest stages of chemotherapy.",

Work in the mouse demonstrated transmission of commensal bacteria from mother to fetus during gestation, though it is unclear what modulates this process. We have previously shown in the nonhuman primate that, independent of obesity, a maternal high-fat diet during gestation and lactation persistently shapes the juvenile gut microbiome. We therefore sought to interrogate in a population-based human longitudinal cohort whether a maternal high-fat diet similarly alters the neonatal and infant gut microbiome in early life. METHODS: A representative cohort was prospectively enrolled either in the early third trimester or intrapartum (n = 163), with a subset consented to longitudinal sampling through the postpartum interval (n = 81). Multiple body site samples, including stool and meconium, were collected from neonates at delivery and by 6 weeks of age. A rapid dietary questionnaire was administered to estimate intake of fat, added sugars, and fiber over the past month (National Health and Examination Survey). DNA was extracted from each infant meconium/stool sample (MoBio) and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis. RESULTS: On average, the maternal dietary intake of fat ranged from 14.0 to 55.2 %, with an average intake of 33.1 % (sigma = 6.1 %). Mothers whose diets significantly differed from the mean (+/-1 standard deviation) were separated into two distinct groups, a control group (n = 13, mu = 24.4 %) and a high-fat group (n = 13, mu = 43.1 %). Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the microbiome of the neonatal stool at birth (meconium) clustered differently by virtue of maternal gestational diet (PERMANOVA p = 0.001). LEfSe feature selection identified several taxa that discriminated the groups, with a notable relative depletion of Bacteroides in the neonates exposed to a maternal high-fat gestational diet (Student's t-test, p < 0.05) that persisted to 6 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to the primate, independent of maternal body mass index, a maternal high-fat diet is associated with distinct changes in the neonatal gut microbiome at birth which persist through 4-6 weeks of age. Our findings underscore the importance of counseling pregnant mothers on macronutrient consumption during pregnancy and lactation.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors associated with rotavirus diarrhea and to describe severity of illness among children <5 years old with non-dysenteric, moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in rural western Kenya. METHODS: We analyzed data from children <5 years old with non-dysenteric MSD enrolled as cases in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in Kenya. A non-dysenteric MSD case was defined as a child with >/=3 loose stools in 24 hrs. and one or more of the following: sunken eyes, skin tenting, intravenous rehydration, or hospitalization, who sought care at a sentinel health center within 7 days of illness onset. Rotavirus antigens in stool samples were detected by ELISA. Demographic and clinical information was collected at enrollment and during a single follow-up home visit at approximately 60 days. We analyzed diarrhea severity using a GEMS 17 point numerical scoring system adapted from the Vesikari score. We used logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with rotavirus infection. RESULTS: From January 31, 2008 to September 30, 2012, among 1,637 (92%) non-dysenteric MSD cases, rotavirus was detected in stools of 245 (15.0%). Rotavirus-positive compared with negative cases were: younger (median age, 8 vs. 13 months; p<0.0001), had more severe illness (median severity score, 9 vs 8; p<0.0001) and had to be hospitalized more frequently (37/245 [15.1%] vs. 134/1,392 [9.6%]), p <0.013). Independent factors associated with rotavirus infection included age 0-11 months old (aOR = 5.29, 95% CI 3.14-8.89) and presenting with vomiting >/=3 times/24hrs (aOR = 2.58, 95% CI [1.91-3.48]). Rotavirus was detected more commonly in warm and dry months than in the cool and rainy months (142/691 [20%] vs 70/673 [10%]) p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea caused by rotavirus is associated with severe symptoms leading to hospitalization. Consistent with other settings, infants had the greatest burden of disease.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Viral infections caused by human bocaviruses 1-4 (HBoV1-4) are more complicated than previously believed. A retrospective, large-scale study was undertaken to explore the prevalence of HBoV1-4 in pediatric patients with various infectious diseases and delineate their phylogenetic characteristics. METHODS: Clinical samples from four specimen types, including 4,941 respiratory, 2,239 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 2,619 serum, and 1,121 fecal specimens, collected from pediatric patients with various infectious diseases were screened for HBoV1-4. A 690-nt fragment in each specimen was then amplified and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Clinical characteristics of HBoV-positive patients with different specimen types available were evaluated. RESULTS: Approximately 1.2% of patients were confirmed as HBoV-positive, with the highest positive rate in patients with gastrointestinal infection (2.2%), followed by respiratory (1.65%), central nervous system (0.8%), and hematological infections (0.2%). A single genetic lineage of HBoV1 circulated among children over the 8-year period, while a new cluster of HBoV2, via intra-genotype recombination between HBoV2A and HBoV2B, was prevalent. Some patients had HBoV1-positive respiratory and serum specimens or fecal specimens. Several cases became HBoV1-positive following the appearance of respiratory infection, while several cases were positive for HBoV2 only in CSF and serum specimens, rather than respiratory specimens. CONCLUSIONS: A single genetic lineage of HBoV1 is speculated as a viral pathogen of respiratory infection and causes both comorbid infection and acute gastroenteritis. Additionally, a new cluster of HBoV2 is prevalent in China, which may infect the host through sites other than the respiratory tract.",

			"abstract": "Group A Rotavirus has been widely described as one of the most important infantile diarrheal pathogens worldwide. In Argentina, it is responsible for over 200,000 acute diarrhea cases and from 30 to 50 deaths annually in children under 5 years. The aim of this study is to analyze frequency, seasonality, age group distribution, and circulating genotypes based on data notified in the 2012-2014 period and in turn to assess the pre-vaccine scenario, considering that rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 2015. Data were taken from the Viral Diarrhea Notification module of the Argentine SNVS-SIVILA surveillance tool. Analyses of circulating genotypes were performed on rotavirus-positive stool specimens by conventional binary characterization of the outermost capsid genes. Overall data showed rotavirus detection in about 25% of samples tested, and higher rates in children under 2 years old were observed. Rotavirus positive cases were distributed according to a typical winter seasonal pattern. A heterogeneous regional pattern of prevalence was also observed, with higher rates detected in the North region. Genotype co-circulation and annual fluctuation were observed. In general, G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G12P[8] were the most frequently detected genotypes. This study represents the last survey taken of a population considered to be naive. J. Med.

The objective of this study was to define the frequency of EAEC among diarrheal children from flood-affected areas as well as sporadic cases, determine multidrug resistance, and evaluation of virulence using an in vivo model of pathogenesis. Stool samples were collected from 225 diarrheal children from 2010 to 2011 from flood-affected areas as well as from sporadic cases in Pakistan. Identified EAEC isolates were characterized by phylogrouping, antibiotic resistance patterns including the extended-spectrum beta lactamase spectrum, single nucleotide polymorphism detection in gyrA and parC, and virulence potential using wax worm, G. mellonella. A total of 35 (12.5%) confirmed EAEC isolates were identified among 225 E. coli isolates. EAEC isolates displayed high resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, and cefaclor. A total of 34.28% were ESBL positive. Single nucleotide polymorphism detection revealed 37.14% and 68.57% isolates were positive for SNPs in gyrA (A660 -T660 ) and parC (C330 -T330 ), respectively. Phylogrouping revealed that B2 phylogroup was more prevalent among all EAEC isolates tested followed by D, A, B1, and non-typeable (NT). Infection of G. mellonella with EAEC showed that killing infective dose was 100% higher than E. coli DH5 alpha control. EAEC are prevalent among Pakistani children with diarrhea, they are highly resistant to antibiotics, and predominantly fall into B2 phylogroup. Epidemiologic surveillance of EAEC and other E. coli pathotypes is critical to assess not only the role of these pathogens in diarrheal disease but also to determine the extent of multidrug resistance among the population.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The exact pathophysiology of meconium passage into the amniotic fluid is unknown, but it is frequently associated with fetal hypoxia. The mean platelet volume (MPV) seems to be a marker of platelet production and consumption and may be related to the severity of some diseases associated with bone marrow, hypoxia, and perinatal infections. We aimed to investigate the association between MPV levels and meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) in infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MPV, serum-reactive protein and hemoglobin levels, and leukocyte and thrombocyte counts were measured in 106 infants with MSAF and a comparison group of 78 healthy control infants. RESULTS: The mean MPV values of the infants with MSAF were statistically significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the hemoglobin levels or leukocyte and thrombocyte counts in the study group compared to the control group (p > 0.05). There was also no statistically significant difference in the MPV levels of the infants with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) compared to the infants with MSAF without MAS (p = 0.107). The optimal cut-off value for the MPV was 9.90 fl (area under the curve [AUC: 0.788]) in the infants with MSAF, with a sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 74.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the MPV levels of infants with MSAF were significantly lower than those of healthy infants. This might be associated with a hypoxic process. However, the MPV levels of infants with MSAF and MAS were statistically similar. Thus, the MPV level could not be used to detect patients with or without severe disease.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The faecal reservoir provides optimal conditions for the transmission of resistance genes within and between bacterial species. As key transmitters of infection within communities, children are likely important contributors to endemic community resistance. We sought to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant faecal Escherichia coli from asymptomatic children aged between 0 and 17 years worldwide, and investigate the impact of routinely prescribed primary care antibiotics to that resistance. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Knowledge databases from 1940 to 2015. Pooled resistance prevalence for common primary care antibiotics, stratified by study country OECD status. Random-effects meta-analysis to explore the association between antibiotic exposure and resistance. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included. In OECD countries, the pooled resistance prevalence to tetracycline was 37.7 % (95 % CI: 25.9-49.7 %); ampicillin 37.6 % (24.9-54.3 %); and trimethoprim 28.6 % (2.2-71.0 %). Resistance in non-OECD countries was uniformly higher: tetracycline 80.0 % (59.7-95.3 %); ampicillin 67.2 % (45.8-84.9 %); and trimethoprim 81.3 % (40.4-100 %). We found evidence of an association between primary care prescribed antibiotics and resistance lasting for up to 3 months post-prescribing (pooled OR: 1.65, 1.36-2.0). CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to many primary care prescribed antibiotics is common among faecal E. coli carried by asymptomatic children, with higher resistance rates in non-OECD countries. Despite tetracycline being contra-indicated in children, tetracycline resistance rates were high suggesting children could be important recipients and transmitters of resistant bacteria, or that use of other antibiotics is leading to tetracycline resistance via inter-bacteria resistance transmission.",

			"abstract": "Asymptomatic infant carriers of toxigenic Clostridium difficile are suggested to play a role in the transmission of C. difficile infection (CDI) in adults. However, the mode of C. difficile carriage in infants remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated longitudinal changes in carriage rates, counts, and strain types of toxigenic C. difficile in infants. Stools collected from 111 healthy infants in Belgium periodically from birth until the age of 6 months were examined by quantitative PCR targeting 16S rRNA and toxin genes. Toxigenic C. difficile was detected in 18 of 111 infants (16%) in the period up to the age of 6 months. The carriage rate of toxigenic C. difficile remained below 5% until the age of 3 months. The carriage rate increased to 13% 1 week after weaning (average age, 143 days) and reached 16% at the age of 6 months. Counts of toxigenic C. difficile bacteria ranged from 10(4) to 10(8) cells/g of stool. Notably, two infants retained >10(8) cells/g of stool for at least several weeks. Average counts in the 18 infants hovered around 10(7) cells/g of stool from the age of 3 days until the age of 6 months, showing no age-related trend. Genotyping of toxigenic C. difficile isolates from the 18 infants revealed that 11 infants each retained a particular monophyletic strain for at least a month. The genotype most frequently identified was the same as that frequently identified in symptomatic adult CDI patients. Thus, toxigenic C. difficile strains-potential causes of CDI in adults-colonized the infants' intestines. IMPORTANCE: Our study provides longitudinal data on counts and strain types of toxigenic C. difficile in infants. We found that considerable numbers of toxigenic C. difficile bacteria colonized the infants' intestines. The results of strain typing suggest that toxigenic C. difficile carried by healthy infants could be potentially pathogenic to adults. These results and findings are informative not only for ecological studies but also for efforts to prevent or control the spread of CDI in adults.",

The G10P[14] viruses (G10-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3) were found to contain multiple genes closely related to RVAs of artiodactyl origin, highlighting the role of inter-host species transmissions of RVAs. From the G/P constellation of all RVA isolates, it could be concluded that approximately one quarter had likely arisen from reassortment events in vivo among RVAs of 'usual' genotypes.",

The hallmark of EPEC pathogenesis is the establishment of attaching and effacing lesions in enterocytes, in which pedestal-like structures are formed underneath adherent bacteria. EPEC are divided into two subgroups, typical (tEPEC) and atypical (aEPEC), based on the presence of the EPEC adherence factor plasmid in tEPEC and its absence in aEPEC. This study was designed to characterize 82 aEPEC isolates obtained from stool samples of diarrhoeic patients during 2012 and 2013 in Brazil. The majority of the aEPEC were assigned to the phylo-group B1 (48.8 %), and intimin subtypes theta (20.7 %), beta1 (9.7 %) and lambda (9.7 %) were the most prevalent among the isolates. The nleB and nleE genes were concomitantly detected in 32.9 % of the isolates, demonstrating the occurrence of the pathogenicity island O122 among them. The O157-plasmid genes (ehxA and/or espP) were detected in 7.3 % of the isolates, suggesting that some aEPEC could be derived from Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli that lost the stx genes while trafficking in the host. PFGE of 14 aEPEC of serotypes O2 : H16, O33 : H34, O39 : H9, O108 : H- and ONT : H19 isolated from five distinct outbreaks showed serotype-specific PFGE clusters, indicating a high degree of similarity among the isolates from the same event, thus highlighting these serotypes as potential aetiologic agents of diarrhoeal outbreaks in Brazil.",

From December 2009 to January 2013, rectal swabs collected from 3796 children in the emergency departments of university hospitals in Marseille, France, were analysed: 555 children (245 female and 310 male, from 6 days to 6 years old) with acute diarrhoea defined as at least three loose stools per day for <1 week and 3241 children (1444 female and 1797 male, from 22 days to 6 years old) without diarrhoea. Specific quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the presence of T. whipplei and of two enteric pathogens Clostridium difficile and Giardia duodenalis. Tropheryma whipplei was significantly more common in children with diarrhoea (22/555, 4%) than without (56/3241, 1.7%; p 0.001). Neither C. difficile nor G. duodenalis showed this association.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed all singleton deliveries that underwent a trial of labor in a single hospital (2007-2013). Exclusion criteria included pregnancy-related complications (e.g., hypertensive disorders, diabetes, oligohydramnios, and fetal anomalies). First, only deliveries with MSAF were analyzed. Perinatal outcome of deliveries at 37(0/7) to 38(6/7) weeks (early term) and 41(0/7) to 41(6/7) weeks (late term) were compared with those at 39(0/7) to 40(6/7) weeks of gestation (full term).

Results During the study period, 28,248 deliveries were considered as low risk. Of them, 3,399 (12.0%) were diagnosed with MSAF and were divided to full term (n = 2,413), early term (n = 405), and late term (n = 581). In multivariate analysis, MSAF at early term was associated with neonatal jaundice, need for phototherapy, and neonatal sepsis. In a gestational age based stratification, when comparing between deliveries with clear amniotic fluid and those with MSAF, late term had the highest odds (4.2 vs. 0.5%; p < 0.001) for neonatal respiratory morbidity. Conclusion Gestational age was associated with specific complications in deliveries complicated by MSAF and otherwise low-risk deliveries.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness caused by enteroviruses. A passive surveillance system has been implemented in Shanghai Pudong since 2008 and etiology surveillance since 2009.We characterized the epidemiology and the etiology of HFMD in Pudong from 2008-2013. METHODOLOGY: Health care providers were required to report any clinically diagnosed HFMD to Pudong District Center for Disease Control and Prevention. For all severe cases and randomly selected mild HFMD cases, throat or rectal swabs or feces were collected for enterovirus detection by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 50,149 cases were reported, with average 8,508 per year (range: 3,577-13,202) and average incidence of 167.5/100,000 persons (range: 81.4-254.1/100,000 persons). HFMD was more likely to occur in children under five years of age (85.6%), while severe cases were more likely to happen in children under three years of age (63.9%). Every year in May or June, HFMD peaked in the region; two peaks were observed from 2011 to 2013.The most common etiologic agents are EV71 and CA16.Different types of enterovirus circulate in different years. EV71 was the predominant pathogen in severe cases. The proportions of EV71 in severe cases was higher than in mild cases at the children's medical center (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HFMD remains an important public health issue in Shanghai. HFMD pathogen surveillance is required for more types of enteroviruses besides EV71 and CA16, which would give a better picture of the etiology of HFMD.",

			"abstract": "Environmental enteropathy (EE), a subclinical intestinal disorder characterized by mucosal inflammation, reduced barrier integrity, and malabsorption, appears to be associated with increased risk of stunting in children in low- and middle-income countries. Fecal biomarkers indicative of EE (neopterin [NEO], myeloperoxidase [MPO], and alpha-1-antitrypsin [AAT]) have been negatively associated with 6-month linear growth. Associations between fecal markers (NEO, MPO, and AAT) and short-term linear growth were examined in a birth cohort of 246 children in Bangladesh. Marker concentrations were categorized in stool samples based on their distribution (< first quartile, interquartile range, > third quartile), and a 10-point composite EE score was calculated. Piecewise linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between markers measured quarterly (in months 3-21, 3-9, and 12-21) and 3-month change in length-for-age z-score (DeltaLAZ). Children with high MPO levels at quarterly time points lost significantly more LAZ per 3-month period during the second year of life than those with low MPO (DeltaLAZ = -0.100; 95% confidence interval = -0.167 to -0.032). AAT and NEO were not associated with growth; however, composite EE score was negatively associated with subsequent 3-month growth. In this cohort of children from an urban setting in Bangladesh, elevated MPO levels, but not NEO or AAT levels, were associated with decreases in short-term linear growth during the second year of life, supporting previous data suggesting the relevance of MPO as a marker of EE.",

			"abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota development influences infants' health and subsequent host physiology. However, the factors shaping the development of the microbiota remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms through which these factors affect gut metabolite profiles have not been extensively investigated. Here we analyse gut microbiota development of 27 infants during the first month of life. We find three distinct clusters that transition towards Bifidobacteriaceae-dominant microbiota. We observe considerable differences in human milk oligosaccharide utilization among infant bifidobacteria. Colonization of fucosyllactose (FL)-utilizing bifidobacteria is associated with altered metabolite profiles and microbiota compositions, which have been previously shown to affect infant health. Genome analysis of infants' bifidobacteria reveals an ABC transporter as a key genetic factor for FL utilization. Thus, the ability of bifidobacteria to utilize FL and the presence of FL in breast milk may affect the development of the gut microbiota in infants, and might ultimately have therapeutic implications.",

In total 681 humans and 753 livestock (chickens, ducks, pigs, cattle) from 269 households were sampled. Children aged <16 years were more frequently Campylobacter positive (19%) than adults (8%) and multilevel logistic models revealed that human C. jejuni positivity was associated with the following household practices: home-slaughtering [odds ratio (OR) 2.4, P = 0.01], allowing animals access to sleeping and food preparation areas (OR 2.8, P = 0.02), and eating undercooked meat (OR 6.6, P = 0.05), while frequent consumption of beef was protective (OR 0.9, P = 0.05).

			"abstract": "The faecal microbiota composition of infants born to mothers receiving intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis with ampicillin against group B Streptococcus was compared with that of control infants, at day 7 and 30 of life. Recruited newborns were both exclusive breastfed and mixed fed, in order to also study the effect of dietary factors on the microbiota composition. Massive parallel sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and qPCR analysis were performed. Antibiotic prophylaxis caused the most marked changes on the microbiota in breastfed infants, mainly resulting in a higher relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, compared with control infants (52% vs. 14%, p = 0.044) and mixed-fed infants (52% vs. 16%, p = 0.13 NS) at day 7 and in a lower bacterial diversity compared to mixed-fed infants and controls. Bifidobacteria were also particularly vulnerable and abundances were reduced in breastfed (p = 0.001) and mixed-fed antibiotic treated groups compared to non-treated groups. Reductions in bifidobacteria in antibiotic treated infants were also confirmed by qPCR. By day 30, the bifidobacterial population recovered and abundances significantly increased in both breastfed (p = 0.025) and mixed-fed (p = 0.013) antibiotic treated groups, whereas Enterobacteriaceae abundances remained highest in the breastfed antibiotic treated group (44%), compared with control infants (16%) and mixed-fed antibiotic treated group (28%). This study has therefore demonstrated the short term consequences of maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on the infant faecal microbial population, particularly in that of breastfed infants.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the level of fecal calprotectin in preterm neonates with feeding intolerance, as well as to evaluate it as a marker of feeding intolerance and to determine a cut-off level of fecal calprotectin in feeding intolerance. METHODS: Analytical, multicenter, case-control study, which was carried out in neonatal intensive care units in Egypt, in a period from August 1, 2014 to March 1, 2015 on 52 preterm neonates. Neonates were classified into two groups; a study group including 26 neonates who met inclusion criteria and a control group including 26 neonates for comparison. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin levels ranged from 3.9mug/g to 971.8mug/g, and there was a significant increase in fecal calprotectin in the study group when compared to the control group (334.3+/-236.6mug/g vs. 42.0+/-38.2mug/g, respectively) with moderate inverse significant correlation between fecal calprotectin and birth weight. Furthermore, there was moderate, significant correlation between fecal calprotectin and duration of breastfeeding range. On the other hand, there was no correlation between fecal calprotectin and post-natal age, gestational age, or volume of feeding. A cut-off at the 67.0mug/g level, with 100.0% sensitivity and 76.9% specificity, was considered. CONCLUSION: Fecal calprotectin level increased significantly in neonates with feeding intolerance; it can be used to detect early cases with necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates, but this subject still needs more investigations on more patients.",

A prospective surveillance network has been set up to investigate the virological and clinical features of RVA infections and to detect the emergence of potentially epidemic strains in France. From 2009 to 2014, RVA-positive stool samples were collected from 4800 children <5 years old attending the paediatric emergency units of 16 large hospitals. Rotaviruses were then genotyped by RT-PCR with regard to their outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7. Genotyping of 4708 RVA showed that G1P[8] strains (62.2%) were predominant. The incidence of G9P[8] (11.5%), G3P[8] (10.4%) and G2P[4] (6.6%) strains varied considerably, whereas G4P[8] (2.7%) strains were circulating mostly locally. Of note, G12P[8] (1.6%) strains emerged during the seasons 2011-12 and 2012-13 with 4.1% and 3.0% prevalence, respectively. Overall, 40 possible zoonotic reassortants, such as G6 (33.3%) and G8 (15.4%) strains, were detected, and were mostly associated with P[6] (67.5%). Analysis of clinical records of 624 hospitalized children and severity scores from 282 of them showed no difference in clinical manifestations or severity in relation to the genotype. The relative stability of RVA genotypes currently co-circulating and the large predominance of P[8] type strains may ensure vaccine effectiveness in France. The surveillance will continue to monitor the emergence of new reassortants that might not respond to current vaccines, all the more so as all genotypes can cause severe infections in infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Twenty-five percent to 50% of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) cases remain etiologically undiagnosed. Our main aim was to determine the most appropriate list of enteric pathogens to be included in the daily diagnostics scheme of AGE, ensuring the lowest possible diagnostic gap. METHODS: Two hundred ninety seven children </=6 years of age, admitted to hospital in Slovenia, October 2011 to October 2012, with AGE, and 88 </=6 years old healthy children were included in the study. A broad spectrum of enteric pathogens was targeted with molecular methods, including 8 viruses, 6 bacteria and 2 parasites. RESULTS: At least one enteric pathogen was detected in 91.2% of cases with AGE and 27.3% of controls. Viruses were the most prevalent (82.5% and 15.9%), followed by bacteria (27.3% and 10.2%) and parasites (3.0% and 1.1%) in cases and controls, respectively. A high proportion (41.8%) of mixed infections was observed in the cases. For cases with undetermined etiology (8.8%), stool samples were analyzed with next generation sequencing, and a potential viral pathogen was detected in 17 additional samples (5.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that tests for rotaviruses, noroviruses genogroup II, adenoviruses 40/41, astroviruses, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella sp. should be included in the initial diagnostic algorithm, which revealed the etiology in 83.5% of children tested. The use of molecular methods in diagnostics of gastroenteritis is preferable because of their high sensitivity, specificity, fast performance and the possibility of establishing the concentration of the target. The latter may be valuable for assessing the clinical significance of the detected enteric, particularly viral pathogens.",

A dilution series of 12 STEC reference strains was tested with the FA-GI Panel to assess the analytical sensitivity. A total of 389 patient samples were analyzed with the FA-GI Panel and confirmation of the detected DEC was attempted with an in-house culture-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. All Shiga toxin genes, except the one encoding Stx2f, were detected in bacterial dilutions ranging from 10(4) to 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. eae + stx2f + STEC was misclassified as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). Different sensitivities for various gene targets present in one isolate led to differing identifications depending on the concentration. Using the in-house method as a reference, the FA-GI Panel had a sensitivity of 90.6 % [confidence interval (CI) 75.0 %-98.0 %] and a specificity of 97.2 % (CI 94.9 %-98.6 %) for STEC detection in feces. At least one DEC was reported in 35.5 % (171/389) of the patient specimens, with EPEC being the most prevalent (n = 71). Only 59.7 % of the detected DEC could be confirmed, presumably because the comparator method was not applied directly on feces. The FA-GI Panel could not detect the stx2f subtype, misclassified certain pathogens, and the high detection rate of EPEC needs further investigation. Nevertheless, we believe that this sensitive and convenient system will prove to be an invaluable tool for the rapid diagnosis of most DEC infections, but culturing of the detected microorganisms should always be attempted.",

			"abstract": "The potentially critical stage of initial gut colonization in premature infants occurs in the hospital environment, where infants are exposed to a variety of hospital-associated bacteria. Because few studies of microbial communities are strain-resolved, we know little about the extent to which specific strains persist in the hospital environment and disperse among infants. To study this, we compared 304 near-complete genomes reconstructed from fecal samples of 21 infants hospitalized in the same intensive care unit in two cohorts, over 3 years apart. The genomes represent 159 distinct bacterial strains, only 14 of which occurred in multiple infants. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, common infant gut colonists, exhibit diversity comparable to that of reference strains, inline with introduction of strains from infant-specific sources rather than a hospital strain pool. Unlike other infants, a pair of sibling infants shared multiple strains, even after extensive antibiotic administration, suggesting overlapping strain-sources and/or genetic selection drive microbiota similarities. Interestingly, however, five strains were detected in infants hospitalized three years apart. Three of these were also detected in multiple infants in the same year. This finding of a few widely dispersed and persistent bacterial colonizers despite overall low potential for strain dispersal among infants has implications for understanding and directing healthy colonization.",

			"article_name": "Acidemia in neonates with a 5-minute Apgar score of 7 or greater - What are the outcomes?",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Apgar score is universally used for fetal assessment at the time of birth, whereas, the collection of fetal cord blood gases is performed commonly in high-risk situations or in the setting of Apgar scores of <7, which is a less standardized approach. It has been well-established that neonatal acidemia at the time of delivery can result in significant neonatal morbidity and death. Because of this association, knowledge of the fetal acid-base status and detection of acidemia at the time of delivery can serve as a sensitive and useful component in the assessment of a neonate's risk. Umbilical cord blood gas analysis is an accurate and validated tool for the assessment of neonatal acidemia at the time of delivery. Because the collection of fetal cord blood gases is not a standardized practice, it is possible that, with such a varied approach, some cases of neonatal acidemia are not detected, particularly in the setting of reassuring Apgar scores. OBJECTIVE: In a setting of universally obtained cord blood gases, we sought to identify the rates of acidemia and associated factors in neonates with 5-minute Apgar scores of >/=7. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study identified all term, singleton, nonanomolous neonates with 5-minute Apgar scores of >/=7. The incidence of umbilical artery pH </=7.0 or </=7.1 and base excess </=-12 mmol/L or </=-10 mmol/L were examined overall and in association with obstetric complications and adverse neonatal outcomes. Chi-squared tests were used to compare proportions, and multivariable logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. RESULTS: In this cohort, the incidence of an umbilical artery pH of </=7.0 was 0.5%, of a pH </=7.1 was 3.4%, of a base excess </=-12 mmol/L was 1.4%, and of </=-10 mmol/L was 4.0%. Rates of neonatal acidemia were greater in the setting of meconium (4.3% vs 3.2%; P<.001), placental abruption (13.2% vs 3.4%; P<.001), and cesarean deliveries (5.8% vs 2.8%; P<.001), despite normal 5-minute Apgar scores. Additionally, umbilical artery pH </=7.0 was associated with an increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted odds ratio, 6.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-14.3) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 6.8-17.4). Base excess of </=-12 mmol/L was also associated with an increased risk of neonatal sepsis (adjusted odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-12.1). Finally, when examined together, neonates with both a pH of </=7.0 and base excess of </=-12 mmol/L continued to demonstrate an increased risk of neonatal intensive care unit admission and respiratory distress syndrome, with adjusted odds ratios of 9.6 and 6.0, respectively. This risk persisted in neonates with a pH of </=7.1 and base excess of </=-10 mmol/L as well, with adjusted odds ratios of 4.5 and 1.1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Because neonates with reassuring Apgar scores have a residual risk of neonatal acidemia that is associated with higher rates of adverse outcomes, the potential utility of obtaining universal cord blood gases should be further investigated.",

			"abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of enteral lactoferrin on the fecal microbiome and contrast those influences with the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment. We theorized that lactoferrin and the NICU habitat shape the fecal microbial composition of very preterm infants. Although functions attributed to lactoferrin include intestinal immune system development and emergence of a healthy gut microbiota, evidence is limited. Twenty-one very low birth weight (VLBW <1500 g) infants received twice-daily talactoferrin (TLf, a drug designation for recombinant human lactoferrin) or its excipient by gastric gavage from day 1-28 of life. Twenty-four-hour fecal samples were collected on day 21 of life and compared with fecal operational taxonomy units (OTUs) in treated and control infants in 2 NICUs. Workflow included fecal DNA isolation, generation of amplicons for the V1-V3 region of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA, and sequencing of a gel-purified multiplex amplicon library using a Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium (Roche, Branford, Connecticut) platform and protocols. Fecal OTUs per infant were higher in NICU 1 vs NICU 2 (P < .001), consistent with fewer antibiotic days (P < .02) and a shorter duration of parenteral nutrition (P < .007) in NICU 1. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the major phyla in infants treated with TLf and placebo. Among Enterobacteriaceae, TLf prophylaxis reduced Enterobacter and Klebsiella, but increased Citrobacter in feces of VLBW infants. Citrobacter caused no neonatal infections in the study population. OTUs for Clostridiaceae increased in NICU 1 among infants treated with TLf. Importantly, OTUs of staphylococci were barely detectable in both NICUs among infants fed TLf. Fewer hospital-acquired infections occurred in infants treated with TLf vs controls, although the reduction was seen mostly in coagulase-negative staphylococci-related bloodstream and central line infections (P = .06). TLf modified the fecal microbiome in VLBW infants, but care practices in the NICU habitat also contributed. Future research must establish whether elimination vs enrichment of gut-related microbiota reduces clinically significant hospital-acquired infections and promotes a healthy commensal microflora in the intestines of VLBW infants.

			"article_name": "Effect of short-term room temperature storage on the microbial community in infant fecal samples.",
			"abstract": "Sample storage conditions are important for unbiased analysis of microbial communities in metagenomic studies. Specifically, for infant gut microbiota studies, stool specimens are often exposed to room temperature (RT) conditions prior to analysis. This could lead to variations in structural and quantitative assessment of bacterial communities. To estimate such effects of RT storage, we collected feces from 29 healthy infants (0-3 months) and partitioned each sample into 5 portions to be stored for different lengths of time at RT before freezing at -80  degrees C. Alpha diversity did not differ between samples with storage time from 0 to 2 hours. The UniFrac distances and microbial composition analysis showed significant differences by testing among individuals, but not by testing between different time points at RT. Changes in the relative abundance of some specific (less common, minor) taxa were still found during storage at room temperature. Our results support previous studies in children and adults, and provided useful information for accurate characterization of infant gut microbiomes. In particular, our study furnished a solid foundation and justification for using fecal samples exposed to RT for less than 2 hours for comparative analyses between various medical conditions.",

			"article_name": "Age-related changes in gut microbiota composition from newborn to centenarian: a cross-sectional study.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the composition of human gut microbiota changes with age; however, few studies have used molecular techniques to investigate the long-term, sequential changes in gut microbiota composition. In this study, we investigated the sequential changes in gut microbiota composition in newborn to centenarian Japanese subjects. RESULTS: Fecal samples from 367 healthy Japanese subjects between the ages of 0 and 104 years were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of amplicons derived from the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Analysis based on bacterial co-abundance groups (CAGs) defined by Kendall correlations between genera revealed that certain transition types of microbiota were enriched in infants, adults, elderly individuals and both infant and elderly subjects. More positive correlations between the relative abundances of genera were observed in the elderly-associated CAGs compared with the infant- and adult-associated CAGs. Hierarchical Ward's linkage clustering based on the abundance of genera indicated five clusters, with median (interquartile range) ages of 3 (0-35), 33 (24-45), 42 (32-62), 77 (36-84) and 94 (86-98) years. Subjects were predominantly clustered with their matched age; however, some of them fell into mismatched age clusters. Furthermore, clustering based on the proportion of transporters predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) showed that subjects were divided into two age-related groups, the adult-enriched and infant/elderly-enriched clusters. Notably, all the drug transporters based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology groups were found in the infant/elderly-enriched cluster. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate some patterns and transition points in the compositional changes in gut microbiota with age. In addition, the transporter property prediction results suggest that nutrients in the gut might play an important role in changing the gut microbiota composition with age.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The importance of Cryptosporidium as a pediatric enteropathogen in developing countries is recognized. METHODS: Data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a 3-year, 7-site, case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and GEMS-1A (1-year study of MSD and less-severe diarrhea [LSD]) were analyzed. Stools from 12,110 MSD and 3,174 LSD cases among children aged <60 months and from 21,527 randomly-selected controls matched by age, sex and community were immunoassay-tested for Cryptosporidium. Species of a subset of Cryptosporidium-positive specimens were identified by PCR; GP60 sequencing identified anthroponotic C. parvum. Combined annual Cryptosporidium-attributable diarrhea incidences among children aged <24 months for African and Asian GEMS sites were extrapolated to sub-Saharan Africa and South Asian regions to estimate region-wide MSD and LSD burdens. Attributable and excess mortality due to Cryptosporidium diarrhea were estimated. FINDINGS: Cryptosporidium was significantly associated with MSD and LSD below age 24 months. Among Cryptosporidium-positive MSD cases, C. hominis was detected in 77.8% (95% CI, 73.0%-81.9%) and C. parvum in 9.9% (95% CI, 7.1%-13.6%); 92% of C. parvum tested were anthroponotic genotypes. Annual Cryptosporidium-attributable MSD incidence was 3.48 (95% CI, 2.27-4.67) and 3.18 (95% CI, 1.85-4.52) per 100 child-years in African and Asian infants, respectively, and 1.41 (95% CI, 0.73-2.08) and 1.36 (95% CI, 0.66-2.05) per 100 child-years in toddlers. Corresponding Cryptosporidium-attributable LSD incidences per 100 child-years were 2.52 (95% CI, 0.33-5.01) and 4.88 (95% CI, 0.82-8.92) in infants and 4.04 (95% CI, 0.56-7.51) and 4.71 (95% CI, 0.24-9.18) in toddlers. We estimate 2.9 and 4.7 million Cryptosporidium-attributable cases annually in children aged <24 months in the sub-Saharan Africa and India/Pakistan/Bangladesh/Nepal/Afghanistan regions, respectively, and ~202,000 Cryptosporidium-attributable deaths (regions combined). ~59,000 excess deaths occurred among Cryptosporidium-attributable diarrhea cases over expected if cases had been Cryptosporidium-negative. CONCLUSIONS: The enormous African/Asian Cryptosporidium disease burden warrants investments to develop vaccines, diagnostics and therapies.",

The concepts of pathophysiology and management of meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) and meconium aspiration syndrome have undergone tremendous change in recent years. Routine intranatal and postnatal endotracheal suctioning of meconium in vigorous infants is no longer recommended. Recent studies have challenged its role even in non-vigorous infants. Supportive therapy like oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation and intravenous fluids are the cornerstone in the management of meconium aspiration syndrome. Availability of surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, high frequency ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has made it possible to salvage more infants with meconium aspiration syndrome. In this review the authors have discussed the current concepts in the pathophysiology and management of MAS. Drugs in trials and future therapeutic targets are also discussed briefly.",

			"article_name": "Trends in the Epidemiology of Campylobacteriosis in Israel (1999-2012).",
			"abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the recent trends in the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis in Israel. A Sentinel Laboratory-Based Surveillance Network for Bacterial Enteric Diseases was established in Israel by the Israel Center for Disease Control (ICDC). This network generated data on subjects from whom Campylobacter spp. was isolated in community and hospital laboratories. Further characterization of the isolates was done at the Campylobacter National Reference Laboratory. Data from these two sources were integrated and analyzed at the ICDC. Between 1999 and 2012, 40,978 Campylobacter stool isolates were reported to the ICDC by the sentinel laboratories. The incidence rate of campylobacteriosis increased from 65.7 per 100,000 in 1999 to 101.7 per 100,000 in 2012. This increase resulted from a significant rise in the incidence of campylobacteriosis in the Jewish population which, since 2009, surpassed the consistent higher incidence of the disease in Israeli Arabs. The peak morbidity in Israel consistently occurred in late spring, with a risk excess in males compared with females, in younger age groups and earlier in the life span among Arabs than among Jews and others. These results suggest that further analytical studies should be carried out to identify risk factors responsible for the increased incidence of campylobacteriosis and better direct prevention and control of the disease in Israel.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STECs) are the most common cause of acute renal failure in children. The present study evaluated a 10-year STEC polymerase chain reaction screening regimen in children. METHODS: All routine stool culture specimens from patients below 10 years of age (n = 10 342) from May 2003 through April 2013 in the County of Jonkoping, Sweden, were included. Patients were divided in 1 group where analyses of STEC were requested by the clinician (n = 2366) and 1 screening group (n = 7976). Patients who were positive for STEC were tested weekly until they were negative. Clinical data were collected through a questionnaire and by reviewing medical records. RESULTS: In specimens from 191 patients, stx was found (162 index cases). The prevalence was 1.8% in the requested group and 1.5% in the screening group (P = .5). Diarrhea was the most frequent symptom reported in 156 cases and of these 29 (19%) had hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and 7 children developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). No difference regarding severity of symptoms between the groups was found. Stx2 predominated in cases with HC (P < .0001) and HUS (P = .04). Median stx shedding duration was 20 days (1-256 days), and no difference in duration was seen between stx types (P = .106-1.00) and presence of eaeA (P = .72). CONCLUSIONS: Most STEC cases were found in the screening group with comparable prevalence and disease severity as in patients where analysis was requested. Furthermore, non-O157 serotypes caused severe disease when carrying stx2, and prolonged shedding of STEC may be a risk for transmission.",

			"abstract": "Background To date, the effects of exclusive breastfeeding duration and timing of solid food introduction on allergy prevention are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of variable feeding practices on intestinal inflammation in infants using faecal eosinophil cationic protein as a surrogate marker and to assess whether faecal eosinophil cationic protein is associated with serum immunoglobulin E. Methods Subjects ( n = 206) were enrolled from the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese CHildren (PATCH) birth cohort study. Stool samples were collected at 6 and 12 months for determining eosinophil cationic protein, and blood was collected for determining total and allergen-specific immunoglobulin E at 12 months. We compared these biomarkers between infants with variable exclusive breastfeeding duration and infants introduced to solid foods at various periods. The association between faecal eosinophil cationic protein, total serum immunoglobulin E and specific immunoglobulin E was also analysed. Results Faecal eosinophil cationic protein was significantly higher in exclusively breastfed infants compared with formula-fed infants and infants who were not exclusively breastfed at 6 months of age ( P < 0.05). At 12 months, infants who were introduced to solid foods at 5-6 months had the lowest faecal eosinophil cationic protein compared with those who were introduced at earlier and later periods. There was no significant association between faecal eosinophil cationic protein and serum immunoglobulin E. Conclusion We found that breastfeeding exclusively for >6 months did not reduce serum immunoglobulin E, but rather increased intestinal inflammation. Faecal eosinophil cationic protein was not associated with total serum immunoglobulin E and specific immunoglobulin E and might not be a useful indictor of immunoglobulin E sensitization in infancy.",

			"abstract": "The most abundance of anti-Salmonella lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was found in feces of naturally born, exclusively breastfed Thai infants. Six strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and one strain of Lactobacillus paracasei were selected and identified. In the co-cultivation assay, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum I62 showed the strongest and broadest antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella Paratyphi A, and Salmonella Typhimurium SA 2093 under the mimicked proximal colon condition, in which glucose and other nutrients were limited. According to GC-MS analysis, the major antibacterial contribution of organic acids secreted by L. plantarum I62 grown in the presence of glucose was dramatically reduced from 95.8 to 41.9 % under glucose-limited niche. The production of low-pK a acids, such as lactic, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic, and 3-phenyllactic acids, was remarkably dropped. Surprisingly, higher-pK a acids such as 5-chlorobenzimidazole-2-carboxylic, pyroglutamic, palmitic, and oleic acids were enhanced. Moreover, cyclic dipeptides, ketones, alkanes, alcohols, and miscellaneous compounds, which were pH-independent antibacterial metabolites, became dominant. The electron microscopy strongly supported the synergistic attacks of the multiple antibacterial components targeting outer and cytoplasmic membranes leading to severe leakage and cell disruption of Salmonella Typhimurium. This strain poses to be a potential probiotic candidate for effectively controlling and treating human foodborne bacterial infection.",

We have aimed to study H. pylori prevalence in all age groups including children and adolescents and to identify potential routes of transmission. METHODS: Subjects from all age groups (children 0-11 years, adolescents 12-17 years and adults >/=18 years of age), recruited from both an urban and a rural community in Northern Norway, were invited to provide stool samples for the diagnosis of H. pylori antigen and to fill in a questionnaire (adult and adolescents only) on gastrointestinal symptoms, lifestyle factors and biometric data. RESULTS: A total of 1 624 (35.3%) of the invited subjects, including 173 (39.3%) of the children, 46 (19.2%) of the adolescents, and 1 416 (36.1%) of the adults, responded to the invitation. H. pylori infection was nearly undetectable (0.6%) among the children, whereas the prevalence increased from 20% in adolescents toward a peak of 45% in the highest age group. Univariate analyses of possible risk factors of H. pylori infection showed significant associations to private well water, the use of outhouse toilet, and having farm animals in childhood, but the associations waned in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In our populations, with apparent high hygienic standards, the transmission of H. pylori infection may start not only in childhood, but also in adolescence, where potential transmission routes may be outdoor toilet use, private well water, and farm animals.",

Although there are well-established reference ranges for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in adults, these have been less well studied in children. The objective was to establish reference ranges in our local population. Method All faecal calprotectin results from 2011 to 2014 were retrospectively collated and grouped according to patient age. Probability plots were used to determine expected upper limit of normal for each age group, and Mann-Whitney test was used to determine statistical difference between groups. Results Upper limit of normal for age groups 1-3.9 years, 4-17.9 years and 18 years plus were 77, 62 and 61  microg/g, respectively. There was a significant difference ( P = 0.0013) between the median calprotectin concentration for the age group 1-3.9 years ( n = 87) and 4-17.9 years ( n = 636) and between the age group 1-3.9 years and 18 years plus ( n = 7953, P = 0.0001), but there was no significant difference between the age groups 4-17.9 years and 18 years plus ( P = 0.4206).

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The microbial colonization of the neonatal gut provides a critical stimulus for normal maturation and development. This process of early microbiota establishment, known to be affected by several factors, constitutes an important determinant for later health. METHODS: We studied the establishment of the microbiota in preterm and full-term infants and the impact of perinatal antibiotics upon this process in premature babies. To this end, 16S rRNA gene sequence-based microbiota assessment was performed at phylum level and functional inference analyses were conducted. Moreover, the levels of the main intestinal microbial metabolites, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate and butyrate, were measured by Gas-Chromatography Flame ionization/Mass spectrometry detection. RESULTS: Prematurity affects microbiota composition at phylum level, leading to increases of Proteobacteria and reduction of other intestinal microorganisms. Perinatal antibiotic use further affected the microbiota of the preterm infant. These changes involved a concomitant alteration in the levels of intestinal SCFA. Moreover, functional inference analyses allowed for identifying metabolic pathways potentially affected by prematurity and perinatal antibiotics use. CONCLUSION: A deficiency or delay in the establishment of normal microbiota function seems to be present in preterm infants. Perinatal antibiotic use, such as intrapartum prophylaxis, affected the early life microbiota establishment in preterm newborns, which may have consequences for later health.",

We studied the effect of intestinal parasitic infection (IPI) on the clinical outcome of malaria in coinfected children. METHODS: In a cross sectional study performed between October 2014 and September 2015, children infected with malaria, as demonstrated by the presence of asexual parasites in Giemsa stained blood films, were enrolled. Stool samples were obtained from participants and subjected to the formol-ether concentration technique for the detection of intestinal parasites. The Complete blood count was performed using an automated haematology analyser (Mindray, BC-2800). The risk ratio, Pearson's chi-square and the student T test were all performed as part of the statistical analyses. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: In all, 405 children successfully took part in the study. The children were between 1 week and 120 months of age (mean +/- SD = 41.5 +/- 33.5). Coinfection with intestinal parasites was observed in 11.6%. The rate of severe malaria (SM) attack in this study was 10.9%. SM was not observed to be associated with age (p = 0.377) or gender (p = 0.387), meanwhile coinfection with intestinal parasites was associated with age (p = 0.003). Among SM cases, IPI prevalence was higher in children with mild (WHO group 3) severe malaria (p = 0.027). Overall, IPI was not observed to be associated with SM (p = 0.656) or malaria parasite density (p = 0.185) or haemoglobin concentration (p = 0.205). The main clinical features of SM observed were hyperpyrexia (68.2%), severe malarial anaemia (61.4%), and multiple convulsion (52.3%). CONCLUSION: IPI was not observed to be associated with the severity of malaria, the malaria parasite density, and the haemoglobin concentration in coinfected children in Cameroon. The clinical outcome of malaria in children coinfected with intestinal parasites may depend on the geographical setting after all.",

			"abstract": "Rotavirus (RV) infection causes acute infantile diarrhoea in humans and animals and remains a major concern for vaccine development. The close proximity of humans to animals may foster cross-species infection resulting in the emergence of novel/unusual strains by genetic reassortment. In this study, we characterized 500 diarrhoeal samples for group A rotaviruses (RVA) from children (n = 290), piglets (n = 95) and calves (n = 115) in Northeast India during 2012-2013. The data showed that 142/500 (28.4%) faecal samples were positive for RVA with the highest level of infection detected in piglets (57/142, 40.1%) followed by children (51/142, 35.9%) and calves (34/142, 23.9%). Sequence-based G- and P-typing showed G1P[8] (25%) and G1P[7] (35%) were the prevailing genotypes in both humans and animals. Single cases of unusual genotypes, i.e. G9P[8], G5P[8] in humans and G1P[13], G1P[23] and G3P[7] in animals were also identified. Cluster analyses of the sequences showed regional strains were genetically closer to their homologous strains. However, human G5P[8] and porcine G1P[8] strains showed homology to heterologous hosts of their prototype strains. The subsequent global spread of unusual RV strains may result in their establishment over time, presenting challenges to future vaccine evaluation programmes. More studies on emerging genotypes are required to elucidate how RVA strains evolve post-vaccination. This study supports the need for continuous surveillance of RVA infections after detecting from diverse hosts in a common setting.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ireland has been shown to have the highest rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in cases of bacteraemia in Europe, according to a report in 2014 from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System Network. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of VRE gut colonization in a cohort of patients in 2014 at Cork University Hospital (CUH) by performing a cross-sectional study using faecal samples submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine investigation from both hospital inpatients and community-based patients. METHODS: Faeces were examined for VRE colonization using selective cultivation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and speciation using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All VRE isolates were evaluated by molecular means for resistance determinants, type, and Insertion Sequence 16 as an indicator of Clonal Complex 17 (CC17). FINDINGS: From the 350 specimens investigated, 67 (19.1%) specimens were positive for VRE [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.0-23.2]. The prevalence of VRE colonization among CUH patients tested in this study (N = 194) was 31.4% (95% CI: 24.7-38.1). By contrast, the general practitioner patient samples (N=29) showed a prevalence of 0%, whereas 22.2% of samples from other hospitals (N=27) were positive for VRE. All isolates were Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and were indicated to contain CC17, though with considerable heterogeneity among the isolates. CONCLUSION: This high prevalence goes some way towards providing an explanation for the current high rates of VRE bacteraemia in Ireland, as well as highlighting the benefits of screening and enhanced infection control practices by all hospitals to control the high rates of VRE observed.",

Identifying the viral agents is critical to the development of effective preventive measures. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of common enteric viruses in children under five years old in Burkina Faso. Stool samples from children with (n = 263) and without (n = 50) diarrhea disorders were collected in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso from November 2011 to September 2012. Rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus and Aichivirus A were detected using real-time or end-point (RT-)PCR. Rotavirus strains were G and P genotyped by multiplex RT-PCR and other viral strains were characterized by sequencing of viral subgenomic segements. At least one viral agent was detected in 85.6% and 72% of the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. Rotavirus (63.5%), adenovirus (31.2%) and genogroup II norovirus (18.2%) were the most prevalent viruses in symptomatic patients, but only rotavirus and genogroup II norovirus were significantly associated with diarrhea (OR: 7.9, 95%CI: 3.7-17; OR: 3.5, 95%CI: 1-11.7, respectively). Sapovirus (10.3%), astrovirus (4.9%), genogroup I norovirus (2.7%) and Aichivirus A (0.8%) were less prevalent. The predominant genotype of rotavirus was G9P[8] (36.5%), and the predominant norovirus strain was GII.4 variant 2012 (71.4%). Among sapovirus, the genogroup II (87.5%) predominated. Astrovirus type 1 (41.7%) was the most frequent astrovirus identified. Aichivirus A belonged to the three genotypes (A, B and C). Enteric adenoviruses type 40 and 41 were identified in 10.2% and 5.1% respectively. Several cases of co-infections were detected. The results highlight the high prevalence and the high diversity of enteric viruses in Burkinabe children.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Faecal elastase-1 (FE1) is a sensitive marker for exocrine pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) leads to maldigestion and subsequent poor weight gain. Thus, FE1 is performed as work-up for children with failure to thrive (FTT). However, EPI in the paediatric population outside of cystic fibrosis (CF) is rare. This study aimed to identify the indications for FE1 testing and their diagnostic yield in children. The secondary aim was to evaluate the cost per case of EPI detected for the various indications. DESIGN: All FE1 tests performed on children (0-18 years) at a tertiary paediatric hospital in Sydney, Australia between 2010 and 2013 (inclusive) were identified. A retrospective chart audit was performed to identify the indication for testing FE1. The diagnostic yield based on FE1 cut-offs <200 and < 100 mug/g were assessed. RESULTS: The most common indication for testing FE1 was \"FTT only\" (71/216, 32.9%), however, in this cohort of patients, FE1 was least likely to be positive with only 2 out of the 71 (2.8%) patients returning a positive result. In comparison, CF was the second most common indication for testing (60/216, 27.8%), but nearly half (48.8%) of tests returned a positive result in this cohort. The cost per case detected (FE1 <200 mug/g) reflected the test yield with an average cost per positive test of $262.50 (AUD2015) for FTT with short-gut syndrome and $420.00 (AUD2015) for CF-related indications. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that for patients with isolated failure to thrive, FE1 testing is low yield and costly.",

MATERIALS & METHODS: Fecal samples from 120 infants collected at the ages of 5, 13 and 31 weeks were analyzed and subjected to qPCR for the detection of several ARGs. RESULTS: The prevalence of ARGs significantly increased for ermB, tetM and tetQ, while it decreased for aac(6')-aph(2'). Birth mode and breastfeeding significantly affected tetQ prevalence. Correlations to bacterial taxa suggest that fluctuations in some ARGs are (partly) attributed to shifts in bacteroides colonization rates. CONCLUSION: Acquisition of ARGs in the gut microbiota occurs shortly after birth and resistome composition fluctuates over the course of several months, reflecting changes in microbial community structure.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is the third leading cause of child death in Zambia. Up to one-third of diarrhea cases resulting in hospitalization and/or death are caused by vaccine-preventable rotavirus. In January 2012, Zambia initiated a pilot introduction of the Rotarix live, oral rotavirus vaccine in all public health facilities in Lusaka Province. METHODS: Between July 2012 and October 2013, we conducted a case-control study at 6 public sector sites to estimate rotavirus vaccine effectiveness (VE) in age-eligible children presenting with diarrhea. We computed the odds of having received at least 1 dose of Rotarix among children whose stool was positive for rotavirus antigen (cases) and children whose stool was negative (controls). We adjusted the resulting odds ratio (OR) for patient age, calendar month of presentation, and clinical site, and expressed VE as (1 - adjusted OR) x 100. RESULTS: A total of 91 rotavirus-positive cases and 298 rotavirus-negative controls who had under-5 card-confirmed vaccination status and were >/=6 months of age were included in the case-control analysis. Among rotavirus-positive children who were age-eligible to be vaccinated, 20% were hospitalized. Against rotavirus diarrhea of all severity, the adjusted 2-dose VE was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], -30% to 58%) among children >/=6 months of age. VE against hospitalized children >/=6 months of age was 56% (95% CI, -34% to 86%). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a higher point estimate for VE against increased severity of illness compared with milder disease, but were not powered to detect a low level of VE against milder disease.",

			"abstract": "The colonization of the infant gut is crucial for early life development. Although the composition and diversity of the infant gut microbiota (GM) has been well described at a taxonomic level, functional aspects of this ecosystem remain unexplored. In the infant gut, lactate is produced by a number of bacteria and plays an important role in the trophic chain of the fermentation process. However, little is known about the lactate-utilizing bacteria (LUB) community in infants and their impact on gut health. By combining culture-based and molecular methods, we intensively studied LUB in fecal samples of 40 healthy infants on both taxonomic and functional levels. We demonstrated metabolic cross-feeding of lactate and identified keystone species specified for lactate utilization. The interactions of such species and their metabolic outcome could have direct impacts on infant health, either beneficial (production of short chain fatty acids) or detrimental (accumulation of hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide). We identified mode of delivery as a strong determinant for lactate-producing and -utilizing bacteria levels. These findings present the early establishment of GM with a novel perspective and emphasize the importance of lactate utilization in infancy.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: A delayed passage of meconium is considered as a risk factor for feed intolerance in preterm neonates. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to review the effects of different therapeutic agents for meconium evacuation on feed tolerance in preterm neonates. METHODS: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of different therapeutic agents for meconium evacuation in preterm neonates (gestation <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1,500 g) using the Cochrane systematic review methodology was undertaken. Databases including Google Scholar were searched in January 2016. The primary outcome was the time to reach full feeds (TFF; >/=120 ml/kg feeds with stoppage of parenteral nutrition >24 h). Secondary outcomes included necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), weight at discharge and adverse effects. The results were summarised as per the GRADE guidelines. RESULTS: Six RCTs (2 each of glycerine suppository and enema, 1 normal saline enema and 1 oral osmotic contrast agent; n = 442) with a low or unclear risk of bias were included. The pooled estimate (random effects model) showed no reduction in TFF [mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -2.47, 2.41, p = 0.98; level of evidence: low]. No differences in NEC [risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% CI 0.63, 4.65, p = 0.30; level of evidence: low] and weight at discharge (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.30, 0.15, p = 0.50; level of evidence: low) were found. The trial assessing oral osmotic contrast agents reported a trend towards a higher incidence of NEC >/= stage II. There were no other adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Limited low-quality evidence indicates that prophylactic glycerine suppository, small volume glycerine/normal saline enema or oral osmotic contrast agents to evacuate meconium did not reduce TFF in preterm neonates. Large, well-designed trials are essential to study this clinically significant issue.",

STUDY DESIGN: Antepartum and intrapartum data were collected at presentation from 79 infants with NAIS and compared with 239 controls and 405 infants with HIE. The relationships between risk factors and NAIS were explored using univariable and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Compared with controls, infants with NAIS more frequently had a family history of seizures/neurologic diseases, primiparous mothers, and male sex. Mothers of infants with NAIS experienced more intrapartum complications: prolonged rupture of membranes (21% vs 2%), fever (14% vs 3%), thick meconium (25% vs 7%), prolonged second stage (31% vs 13%), tight nuchal cord (15% vs 6%), and abnorm8al cardiotocography (67% vs 21%). Male sex (OR 2.8), family history of seizures (OR 6.5) or neurologic diseases (OR 4.9), and >/=1 (OR 5.8) and >/=2 (OR 21.8) intrapartum complications were independently associated with NAIS. Infants with NAIS and HIE experienced similar rates though different patterns of intrapartum complications. Maternal fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, prolonged second stage, tight nuchal cord, and failed ventouse delivery were more common in NAIS; thick meconium, sentinel events, and shoulder dystocia were more frequent in HIE. Abnormal cardiotocography occurred in 67% of NAIS and 77.5% of infants with HIE. One infant with NAIS and no infant with HIE was delivered by elective cesarean (10% of controls). CONCLUSIONS: NAIS is multifactorial in origin and shares risk factors in common with HIE. Intrapartum events may play a more significant role in the pathogenesis of NAIS than previously recognized.",

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the influence of delivery method on gut and airway colonization patterns in the first year of life in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 (COPSAC2010) birth cohort. METHODS: Seven hundred children from the COPSAC2010 birth cohort participated in this analysis. Fecal samples were collected at age 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year, and hypopharyngeal aspirates were collected at age 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months and cultured for bacteria. Detailed information on delivery method, intrapartum antibiotics, and lifestyle factors was obtained by personal interviews. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the children were born by means of natural delivery, 12% by means of emergency cesarean section, and 9% by means of elective cesarean section. Birth by means of cesarean section was significantly associated with colonization of the intestinal tract by Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus at age 1 week, whereas colonization by Escherichia coli was associated with natural birth. At age 1 month, these differences were less prominent, and at age 1 year, they were not apparent, which was confirmed by means of multivariate data-driven partial least squares analyses. The initial airway microbiota was unaffected by birth method. CONCLUSION: Delivery by means of cesarean section was associated with early colonization patterns of the neonatal gut but not of the airways. The differences normalized within the first year of life. We speculate that microbial derangements, as indicated in our study, can demonstrate a possible link between delivery by means of cesarean section and immune-mediated disease.",

OBJECTIVES: This study describes type 1 and type 3 wild poliovirus (WPV) importation, incidence, geographic distribution and control since the original interruption of transmission in Cameroon. STUDY DESIGN: Stool samples from AFP patients under the age of 15 years in Cameroon were collected nationwide and subjected to virus isolation on RD and L20B cell cultures. Resulting virus isolates were typed by intratypic differentiation (ITD) and analysis of the VP1 coding sequence of the viral genome. Surveillance data originating from Cameroon between 2000 and 2014 were considered for retrospective descriptive analyses. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2009, multiple WPV importation events from neighboring countries affected mainly in the northern regions of Cameroon but did not led to sustained local transmission. Throughout this period, 16 WPV1 and 5 WPV3 were detected and identified as members of multiple clusters within type-specific West Africa B genotypes (WEAF-B). In 2013-2014, a polio outbreak associated to a highly evolved (\"orphan\") WPV1 affected four southern regions of Cameroon. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of highly evolved lineage of type 1 WPV suggests potential surveillance gap and underscore the need to maintain comprehensive polio immunization activities and sensitive surveillance systems in place as long as any country in the world remains endemic for WPV.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Bacterial colonization and succession of the human intestine shape development of immune function and risk for allergic disease, yet these processes remain poorly understood. We investigated the relations between delivery mode, initial bacterial inoculation of the infant oropharynx (OP), and intestinal colonization. METHODS: We prospectively collected maternal rectal and vaginal swabs, infant OP aspirates, and infant stool from 23 healthy mother/infant pairs delivering by cesarean (CS) or vaginal delivery (VD) in an academic hospital. Bacterial abundance (16S rRNA sequencing) and community similarity between samples were compared by delivery mode. Shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing of infant stool was performed. RESULTS: VD infants had higher abundance of Firmicutes (mainly lactobacilli) in OP aspirates whereas CS OP aspirates were enriched in skin bacteria. OP aspirates were more similar to maternal vaginal and rectal microbiomes in VD compared with CS. Bacteroidetes were more abundant through 6 weeks in stool of VD infants. Infant fecal microbiomes in both delivery groups did not resemble maternal rectal or vaginal microbiomes. Differences in fecal bacterial gene potential between CS and VD at 6 weeks clustered in metabolic pathways and were mediated by abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. CONCLUSIONS: CS infants exhibited different microbiota in the oral inoculum, a chaotic pattern of bacterial succession, and a persistent deficit of intestinal Bacteroidetes. Pioneer OP bacteria transferred from maternal vaginal and intestinal communities were not prominent constituents of the early infant fecal microbiome. Oral inoculation at birth may impact the intestinal microenvironment, thereby modulating early succession of intestinal bacteria.",

We aimed at assessing the response of C-section-delivered infant microbiota to a formula containing Lactobacillus reuteri Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM) 17938 and comparing it with that of vaginally delivered infants. METHODS: Infants delivered by C-section (C) and vaginally (V) were randomized to receive either control formula (CCt, n = 10; VCt, n = 10) or the same formula containing L reuteri (CLr, n = 11; VLr, n = 9) within 72 hours following birth. Stool samples were collected at 2 weeks and 4 months of age. Microbial DNA was extracted, amplified, and pyrosequenced. RESULTS: The phylogenetic profiles of the CLr, VCt, and VLr microbiota were not significantly different at any age but diverged from that of CCt at 2 weeks. Compared with VCt, CCt displayed lower Bifidobacterium and higher Enterobacter, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and unclassified Clostridiaceae relative abundance at 2 weeks, as well as lower Collinsella and higher Enterococcus and Coprococcus abundance at 4 months. The level of most of these taxa was not significantly different between the CLr and the vaginal-delivery groups. Compared with VCt, the only difference observed in VLr microbiota was higher Lactobacillus at the 2 study ages and Coprococcus at 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a formula containing L reuteri DSM 17938 does not essentially alter the microbiota in vaginally born infants. In C-section-delivered infants, however, this strain seems to play the role of keystone species by modulating the early development of the microbiota toward the composition found after vaginal delivery.",

The human gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining health in humans of different ages, and especially in the elderly. However, the GI microbiota, whose metabolism and composition changes with age, may also be responsible for the activation of mutagenic substances reaching the colon with diet. Probiotics and prebiotics are promising in terms of reducing the destructive effects of HAAs. The aim of the study was to determine if fecal microbiota derived from the feces of 27 volunteers: infants (up to 18 months), adults (aged 23-39 years), the sub-elderly (aged 64-65 years), and the elderly (aged 76-87 years), and the presence of probiotics or prebiotics, affected the transformation of IQ (2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline) to 7-OH-IQ (2-amino-3,6-dihydro-3-methyl-7H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline-7-one). The compounds were identified using LC-MS(n), NMR, and FTIR. Their genotoxicity was compared in the comet assay. Individual strains capable of IQ transformation were also identified. 7-OH-IQ was detected in six persons (two children and four elderly individuals). The degree of IQ conversion ranged from 26% (4-month-old girl) to 94% (81-year-old woman) of the initial quantity. Four Enterococcus isolates: two Enterococcus faecium and two Enterococcus faecalis strains, as well as one Clostridium difficile strain (LOCK 1030, from the culture collection) converted IQ to 7-OH-IQ. The genotoxicity of samples containing 7-OH-IQ was even three times higher (P < 0.05) than those with IQ and was correlated with the degree of IQ conversion and 7-OH-IQ concentration.",

			"abstract": "The intestinal microbiome is a unique ecosystem that influences metabolism in humans. Experimental evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota can transfer an obese phenotype from humans to mice. Since mothers transmit intestinal microbiota to their offspring during labor, we hypothesized that among vaginal deliveries, maternal body mass index is associated with neonatal gut microbiota composition. We report the association of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index on stool microbiota from 74 neonates, 18 born vaginally (5 to overweight or obese mothers) and 56 by elective C-section (26 to overweight or obese mothers). Compared to neonates delivered vaginally to normal weight mothers, neonates born to overweight or obese mothers had a distinct gut microbiota community structure (weighted UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p < 0.001), enriched in Bacteroides and depleted in Enterococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Hydrogenophilus. We show that these microbial signatures are predicted to result in functional differences in metabolic signaling and energy regulation. In contrast, among elective Cesarean deliveries, maternal body mass index was not associated with neonatal gut microbiota community structure (weighted UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p = 0.628). Our findings indicate that excess maternal pre-pregnancy weight is associated with differences in neonatal acquisition of microbiota during vaginal delivery, but not Cesarean delivery. These differences may translate to altered maintenance of metabolic health in the offspring.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Norovirus is an important cause of childhood diarrhea. We present data from a longitudinal, multicountry study describing norovirus epidemiology during the first 2 years of life. METHODS: A birth cohort of 1457 children across 8 countries contributed 7077 diarrheal stools for norovirus testing. A subset of 199 children contributed additional asymptomatic samples (2307) and diarrheal stools (770), which were used to derive incidence rates and evaluate evidence for acquired immunity. RESULTS: Across sites, 89% of children experienced at least 1 norovirus infection before 24 months, and 22.7% of all diarrheal stools were norovirus positive. Severity of norovirus-positive diarrhea was comparable to other enteropathogens, with the exception of rotavirus. Incidence of genogroup II (GII) infection was higher than genogroup I and peaked at 6-11 months across sites. Undernutrition was a risk factor for symptomatic norovirus infection, with an increase in 1 standard deviation of length-for-age z score associated with a 17% reduction (odds ratio, 0.83 [95% confidence interval, .72-.97]; P = .011) in the odds of experiencing diarrhea when norovirus was present, after accounting for genogroup, rotavirus vaccine, and age. Evidence of acquired immunity was observed among GII infections only: Children with prior GII infection were found to have a 27% reduction in the hazard of subsequent infection (hazard ratio, 0.727; P = .010). CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of norovirus across 8 sites in highly variable epidemiologic settings and demonstration of protective immunity for GII infections provide support for investment in vaccine development.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Giardia duodenalis is an important intestinal protozoan in humans worldwide with high infection rates occurring in densely populated and low resource settings. The parasite has been recorded to cause diarrhea in children. This study was carried out to identify G. duodenalis assemblages and sub-assemblages in children presenting with diarrhea in Kenya. METHODS: A total of 2112 faecal samples were collected from children aged </= 5 years and screened for the presence of Giardia cysts using microscopy. A total of 96 (4.5%) samples were identified as Giardia positive samples and were genotyped using glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) and beta-giardin loci. RESULTS: The three markers successfully genotyped 72 isolates and grouped 2 (1.4) isolates as Assemblage A, 64 (88.9) as Assemblage B and 7 (9.7%) consisted of mixed infections with assemblage A and B. A further analysis of 50 isolates using GDH Polymerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) categorized 2 assemblage A isolates as sub-assemblage AII while 6 and 14 assemblage B isolates were categorized into sub-assemblage BIII and BIV respectively. A mixed infection with sub-assemblage BIII and BIV was recorded in 28 isolates. Over half (55.6%) of Giardia infections were recorded among the children between 13 to 48 months old. CONCLUSION: This paper reports the first data on the assemblages and sub-assemblages of Giardia duodenalis in children representing with diarrhea in Kenya.",

OBJECTIVES: Describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and factors associated with SaV gastroenteritis in hospitalised children <5 years of age in South Africa. STUDY DESIGN: Between 2009 and 2013 during prospective diarrhoeal surveillance, stool specimens were collected from four sites and screened for SaVs and associated enteric pathogens using ELISA, microscopy, conventional and real-time PCR. Epidemiological and clinical data were compared in patients with or without SaV. Odds ratios were assessed by bivariate and stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Sapoviruses were detected in 7.7% (238/3103) of children admitted to hospital and 11.4% (9/79) of deaths. Sapovirus was detected more commonly in children 19-24 months compared to<6months (aOR=2.3; p=0.018) and in males (aOR=2.0; p=0.001). Additional factors associated with SaV detection included residing with>/=7 inhabitants compared to </=3 (aOR=2.2; p=0.011) and concomitant norovirus infections (aOR=3.0; p=0.003). HIV-infected children with SaV were more likely to have bloody stools (aOR=16.8; p<0.001), low birth weight (<2.5kg; aOR=5.8; p=0.007) and live in environments without flush toilets (aOR=8.1; p=0.003) compared to HIV-uninfected children. CONCLUSIONS: Sapoviruses, which are perceived to cause mild diarrhoea, were detected in hospitalised children and diarrhoeal deaths in South Africa. Determinants increasing the odds of SaV included overcrowding and concomitant infections while HIV-infected children with SaV displayed bloody stools, low birth weight and reduced access to proper sanitation. Mitigation strategies against SaV infections include improved sanitation.",

Inappropriate bacterial colonization with Enterobacteriaceae is implicated, but no specific pathogen has been identified. We identify uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) colonization as a significant risk factor for the development of NEC and subsequent mortality. We describe a large-scale deep shotgun metagenomic sequence analysis of the early intestinal microbiome of 144 preterm and 22 term infants. Using a pan-genomic approach to functionally subtype the E. coli, we identify genes associated with NEC and mortality that indicate colonization by UPEC. Metagenomic multilocus sequence typing analysis further defined NEC-associated strains as sequence types often associated with urinary tract infections, including ST69, ST73, ST95, ST127, ST131, and ST144. Although other factors associated with prematurity may also contribute, this report suggests a link between UPEC and NEC and indicates that further attention to these sequence types as potential causal agents is needed.",

To better define the role of NoV as a cause of sporadic gastroenteritis we investigated its prevalence in the patients seen in our paediatric hospital with special emphasis on its seasonal and age distribution. Over a 12-month period discarded stool specimens submitted to our paediatric hospital for testing of an infectious aetiology were retrieved and additionally tested for NoV by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; demographical and clinical information were also obtained. Overall, NoV was the single most commonly identified pathogen and found in 68/892 (7.6%) total specimens or 68/258 (26%) of pathogen-positive specimens. The highest rates of NoV were detected in children aged 6 months to 4 years (50/332, 15.1%) and presenting between October and January (46/314, 14.7%).

			"abstract": "Different factors are known to influence the early gut colonization in newborns, among them the perinatal use of antibiotics. On the other hand, the effect on the baby of the administration of antibiotics to the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), has received less attention, although routinely used in group B Streptococcus positive women to prevent the infection in newborns. In this work, the fecal microbiota of neonates born to mothers receiving IAP and of control subjects were compared taking advantage for the first time of high-throughput DNA sequencing technology. Seven different 16S rDNA hypervariable regions (V2, V3, V4, V6 + V7, V8, and V9) were amplified and sequenced using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. The results obtained showed significant differences in the microbial composition of newborns born to mothers who had received IAP, with a lower abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes as well as an overrepresentation of Proteobacteria. Considering that the seven hypervariable regions showed different discriminant ability in the taxonomic identification, further analyses were performed on the V4 region evidencing in IAP infants a reduced microbial richness and biodiversity, as well as a lower number of bacterial families with a predominance of Enterobacteriaceae members. In addition, this analysis pointed out a significant reduction in Bifidobacterium spp. strains. The reduced abundance of these beneficial microorganisms, together with the increased amount of potentially pathogenic bacteria, may suggest that IAP infants are more exposed to gastrointestinal or generally health disorders later in age.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut bacteria might predispose to or protect from necrotising enterocolitis, a severe illness linked to prematurity. In this observational prospective study we aimed to assess whether one or more bacterial taxa in the gut differ between infants who subsequently develop necrotising enterocolitis (cases) and those who do not (controls). METHODS: We enrolled very low birthweight (1500 g and lower) infants in the primary cohort (St Louis Children's Hospital) between July 7, 2009, and Sept 16, 2013, and in the secondary cohorts (Kosair Children's Hospital and Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University) between Sept 12, 2011 and May 25, 2013. We prospectively collected and then froze stool samples for all infants. Cases were defined as infants whose clinical courses were consistent with necrotising enterocolitis and whose radiographs fulfilled criteria for Bell's stage 2 or 3 necrotising enterocolitis. Control infants (one to four per case; not fixed ratios) with similar gestational ages, birthweight, and birth dates were selected from the population after cases were identified. Using primers specific for bacterial 16S rRNA genes, we amplified and then pyrosequenced faecal DNA from stool samples. With use of Dirichlet multinomial analysis and mixed models to account for repeated measures, we identified host factors, including development of necrotising enterocolitis, associated with gut bacterial populations. FINDINGS: We studied 2492 stool samples from 122 infants in the primary cohort, of whom 28 developed necrotising enterocolitis; 94 infants were used as controls. The microbial community structure in case stools differed significantly from those in control stools. These differences emerged only after the first month of age. In mixed models, the time-by-necrotising-enterocolitis interaction was positively associated with Gammaproteobacteria (p=0.0010) and negatively associated with strictly anaerobic bacteria, especially Negativicutes (p=0.0019). We studied 1094 stool samples from 44 infants in the secondary cohorts. 18 infants developed necrotising enterocolitis (cases) and 26 were controls. After combining data from all cohorts (166 infants, 3586 stools, 46 cases of necrotising enterocolitis), there were increased proportions of Gammaproteobacteria (p=0.0011) and lower proportions of both Negativicutes (p=0.0013) and the combined Clostridia-Negativicutes class (p=0.0051) in infants who went on to develop necrotising enterocolitis compared with controls. These associations were strongest in both the primary cohort and the overall cohort for infants born at less than 27 weeks' gestation. INTERPRETATION: A relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (ie, Gram-negative facultative bacilli) and relative paucity of strict anaerobic bacteria (especially Negativicutes) precede necrotising enterocolitis in very low birthweight infants. These data offer candidate targets for interventions to prevent necrotising enterocolitis, at least among infants born at less than 27 weeks' gestation.

Here we used metagenomic analysis to systematically characterize fecal microbiomes of children with and without CF, demonstrating marked CF-associated taxonomic dysbiosis and functional imbalance. We further showed that these taxonomic and functional shifts were especially pronounced in young children with CF and diminished with age. Importantly, the resulting dysbiotic microbiomes had significantly altered capacities for lipid metabolism, including decreased capacity for overall fatty acid biosynthesis and increased capacity for degrading anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids. Notably, these functional differences correlated with fecal measures of fat malabsorption and inflammation. Combined, these results suggest that enteric fat abundance selects for pro-inflammatory GI microbiota in young children with CF, offering novel strategies for improving the health of children with CF-associated fat malabsorption.",

Epidemiological and clinical data obtained from patients excreting Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in stool who consulted at the hospital were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty five (5 %) of 712 patients had S. stercoralis larvae in one stool sample; 62.8 % came from rural areas and 91.7 % were poor; 68.5 % (24/35) were 21 years old or older. Eight patients (22.8 %) had no predisposing illness; 3 (8.6 %) received steroid treatment, 29/35 (82.8 %) presented with persistent diarrhea and 24/35 (68.5 %) presented following comorbidities: HIV/AIDS (31.4 %), alcoholism alone (11.4 %) or with other associated illness (8.6 %), malignancy (8.6 %), renal failure (5.7 %) and hyperthyroidism (2.8 %).

The antibacterial activity of twelve Bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from human feces was examined in vitro against a wide range of Gram negative pathogenic strains isolated from 30 infant patients (3 days to 5 years old) with diarrhea.

The bactericidal activity, growth curve, adherence to the cellular HEp-2 substratum and production of soluble virulence factors have been assessed in the presence of different Bifidobacterium sp. cultures and fractions (whole culture and free-cell supernatants). Among the twelve Bifidobacterium sp. strains, the largest spectrum of antimicrobial activity against 9 of the 18 enteropathogenic strains was revealed for a B. breve strain recently isolated from infant intestinal feces. The whole culture and free-cell supernatant of B. breve culture decreased the multiplication rate, shortened the log phase and the total duration of the growth curve, with an earlier entrance in the decline phase and inhibited the adherence capacity to a cellular substratum and the swimming/swarming motility too.

			"article_name": "LInking EDCs in maternal Nutrition to Child health (LINC study) - protocol for prospective cohort to study early life exposure to environmental chemicals and child health.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The presence of chemicals in the environment is ubiquitous. Human biomonitoring studies have shown that various chemicals can be detected in the majority of the population, including pregnant women. These compounds may pass the placenta, and reach the fetus. This early life exposure in particular may be detrimental as some chemicals may disrupt the endocrine system, which is involved in various processes during development. The LINC study is a prospective birth cohort designed to study associations between early life environmental exposures and child health, including growth and neurodevelopment. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of this cohort. METHODS AND DESIGN: Recruitment for this cohort has started in 2011 in three Dutch areas and is still ongoing. To date over 300 mother-child pairs have been included. Women are preferably included during the first trimester of pregnancy. Major congenital anomalies and twin births are reasons for exclusion. To assess exposure to environmental chemicals, cord blood, placenta, meconium and vernix are collected. Parents collect urine of the child shortly after birth and breast milk in the second month of life. Exposure to a broad range of environmental chemicals are determined in cord plasma and breast milk. Furthermore various hormones, including leptin and cortisone, are determined in cord plasma, and in heel prick blood spots (thyroxine). Data on anthropometry of the child is collected through midwives and youth health care centres on various time points until the child is 18 months of age. Furthermore cognitive development is monitored by means of the van Wiechen scheme, and information on behavioral development is collected by means of the infant behavior questionnaire and the child behavior checklist. When the child is 12 months of age, a house visit is scheduled to assess various housing characteristics, as well as hand-to-mouth behavior of the child. At this visit exposure of the child to flame retardants (with endocrine disrupting properties) in house dust is determined by means of body wipes. They are furthermore also measured in a saliva sample of the child. Next to these measurements, women receive questionnaires each trimester regarding amongst others lifestyle of the parents, general health of the parents and the child, and mental state of the mother. DISCUSSION: This study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the VU University Medical Centre. Consent for the infant is given by the mother, who is specifically required to give consent for both herself as well as her child. Results will be published regardless of the findings of this study, and will be widely disseminated among related medical stakeholders (e.g. midwives and pediatricians), policy makers, and the general public.",

			"abstract": "Arcobacter butzleri has been linked to enteric disease in humans, but its pathogenicity and epidemiology remain poorly understood. The lack of suitable detection methods is a major limitation. Using comparative genome analysis, we developed PCR primers for direct detection and quantification ofA. butzleri DNA in microbiologically complex matrices. These primers, along with existing molecular and culture-based methods, were used to detectA. butzleri and enteric pathogens in stools of diarrheic and nondiarrheic people (n= 1,596) living in southwestern Alberta, Canada, from May to November 2008. In addition, quantitative PCR was used to compare A. butzleridensities in diarrheic and nondiarrheic stools.Arcobacter butzleriwas detected more often by PCR (59.6%) than by isolation methods (0.8%). Comparison by PCR-based detection found no difference in the prevalence ofA. butzleri between diarrheic (56.7%) and nondiarrheic (45.5%) individuals. Rates of detection in diarrheic stools peaked in June (71.1%) and October (68.7%), but there was no statistically significant correlation between the presence ofA. butzleri and patient age, sex, or place of habitation. Densities ofA. butzleriDNA in diarrheic stools (1.6 +/- 0.59 log10 copies mg(-1)) were higher (P= 0.007) than in nondiarrheic stools (1.3 +/- 0.63 log10copies mg(-1)). Of the 892 diarrheic samples that were positive for A. butzleri, 74.1% were not positive for other bacterial and/or viral pathogens. The current study supports previous work suggesting that A. butzleri pathogenicity is strain specific and/or dependent on other factors, such as the level of host resistance.",

			"article_name": "Routine Use of Probiotics in Preterm Infants: Longitudinal Impact on the Microbiome and Metabolome.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microbial supplements that colonize the gut and potentially exert health benefit to the host. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the impact of a probiotic (Infloran(R): Lactobacillus acidophilus-NCIMB701748 and Bifidobacterium bifidum-ATCC15696) on the bacterial and metabolic function of the preterm gut while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and following discharge. METHODS: Stool samples (n = 88) were collected before, during, and after probiotic intake from 7 patients, along with time-matched controls from 3 patients. Samples were also collected following discharge home from the NICU. Samples underwent bacterial profiling analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR), as well as metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Bacterial profiling showed greater Bifidobacterium (15.1%) and Lactobacillus (4.2%) during supplementation compared to the control group (4.0% and 0%, respectively). While Lactobacillus became reduced after the probiotic had been stopped, Bifidobacterium remained high following discharge, suggestive of successful colonisation. qPCR analysis showed a significant increase (p </= 0.01) in B. bifidum in infants who received probiotic treatment compared to controls, but no significant increase was observed for L. acidophilus (p = 0.153). Metabolite profiling showed clustering based on receiving probiotic or matched controls, with distinct metabolites associated with probiotic administration. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic species successfully colonise the preterm gut, reducing the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria, and effecting gut functioning. Bifidobacterium (but not Lactobacillus) colonised the gut in the long term, suggesting the possibility that therapeutically administered probiotics may continue to exert important functional effects on gut microbial communities in early infancy.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Fetal brain maturation is disrupted by preterm birth. Inflammation during the neonatal period may further harm neurodevelopmental outcomes. The present study aimed to determine the effect of short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides/long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides/pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS) on neurodevelopmental outcomes measured by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development in preterm infants at 24 months. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS or placebo was supplemented between days 3 and 30 of life. Serum samples at day 1, 7, and 14 were analyzed for cytokine levels. Stool samples at day 1, 7, 14, and 30 were measured for bacterial count and bifidobacteria percentage. At 24 months corrected age infants were followed up by a blinded pediatric psychologist for the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development II or III. RESULTS: Seventy-seven of one hundred one (76%) eligible infants participated in the follow-up study. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were not different in the scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS and placebo group. Infections during the neonatal period, lower percentages of bifidobacteria at day 7 (F = 3.8, P = 0.05) and day 14 (F = 5.0, P = 0.02) and higher levels of Interleukine (IL)-1beta (F = 4.0, P = 0.04) and IL-8 (F = 8.0, P = 0.01) at day 7 are associated with lower mental developmental index. Lower psychomotor outcomes are associated with IL-2 (F = 4.0, P = 0.05), IL-4 (F = 6.0, P = 0.02) at birth, and interferon gamma at day 7 (F = 4.4, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS showed no significant improvement of neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months in preterm infants. Infections, lower bifidobacteria counts, and higher serum cytokine levels during the neonatal period were associated with lower neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months of age indicating the relevance of microbiome and immune responses in neurodevelopmental processes.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated AmpCs (pAmpCs), and carbapenemases (\"MDR Enterobacteriaceae\") colonizing children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: 40-bed PICU. METHODS: Admission and weekly thereafter rectal surveillance swabs were collected on all pediatric patients during a 6-month study period. Routine phenotypic identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed. Enterobacteriaceae displaying characteristic resistance profiles underwent further molecular characterization to identify genetic determinants of resistance likely to be transmitted on mobile genetic elements and to evaluate relatedness of strains including DNA microarray, multilocus sequence typing, repetitive sequence-based PCR, and hsp60 sequencing typing. RESULTS: Evaluating 854 swabs from unique children, the overall prevalence of colonization with an MDR Enterobacteriaceae upon admission to the PICU based on beta-lactamase gene identification was 4.3% (n=37), including 2.8% ESBLs (n=24), 1.3% pAmpCs (n=11), and 0.2% carbapenemases (n=2). Among 157 pediatric patients contributing 603 subsequent weekly swabs, 6 children (3.8%) acquired an incident MDR Enterobacteriaceae during their PICU stay. One child acquired a pAmpC (E. coli containing bla DHA) related to an isolate from another patient. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 4% of children admitted to a PICU were colonized with MDR Enterobacteriaceae (based on beta-lactamase gene identification) and an additional 4% of children who remained in the PICU for at least 1 week acquired 1 of these organisms during their PICU stay. The acquired MDR Enterobacteriaceae were relatively heterogeneous, suggesting that a single source was not responsible for the introduction of these resistance mechanisms into the PICU setting.",

METHODS: Retrospective non interventional hospital-based study analyzed laboratory results from the period 2002 to 2011 of fresh and Ziehl-Nielsen carbolfuchsin stained routine stool samples received for parasitologic examination. Sporadically a sample with numerous oocysts was allowed to sporulate in 2.5 % potassium dichromate confirming the presence of bi-cystic bi-zoic oocysts. RESULTS: A total of 35,157 fecal samples were examined during a ten-year span, of which a third (28.4 %) was stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen carbolfuchsin method diagnosing a total of 125 (1.3 %) C.cayetanensis infections. A statistically significant apparent seasonality was observed most years during May to August (range p < 0.036-0.001), with 83.3 % of 125 cases occurring in those rainy months. All C. cayetanensis cases came from urban poor neighborhoods; male/female relation was 1:1 except in 2006, when all patients were females (p = 0.05; r(2) = 22,448). Forty four point eight percent of the stool samples were diarrheic or liquid and 65.6 % infections were identified in children 10 years old or less. Enteric helminths and protozoa co-infected Cyclospora positive patients in 52 instances.: 8 % Ascaris lumbricoides, 8 % Giardia duodenalis, 23.2 % Blastocystis spp. and less frequently Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Trichuris trichiura. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a seasonal pattern for Cyclospora infections diagnosed in a clinical setting during the rainy months in Tegucigalpa and surrounding areas. Community studies should be conducted to support or dispute these observations.",

			"abstract": "Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is of great concern due to the vulnerability of fetus. Nineteen Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 18 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) including DDTs, HCHs, chlordanes, and hexachlorobenzene, and 22 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were measured in meconium samples from 72 newborn infants using high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The median concentrations (on wet weight basis) of PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs were 26.8pg/g, 66.7pg/g, and 2.32pg/g, respectively. Highly significant correlations were observed among the compounds of PCBs and OCPs, suggesting their similar sources and kinetic behaviors. BDE 47 had significant correlations with PCBs and OCPs, whereas BDE 209 was not correlated with any of the contaminants due to different exposure sources. The concentrations of p,p'-DDE, beta-HCH, and trans-nonaCHL between paired maternal blood-meconium and cord blood-meconium showed significant correlations, while PCBs and PBDEs were not significantly correlated in the paired samples. Maternal age and gestational age were demographic parameters affecting POP levels in meconium. Multiple regression analysis showed that the levels of several OCPs in cord and maternal serum were contributing factors governing the levels of these contaminants in meconium. Our results indicate that meconium can be utilized as a human matrix for prenatal exposure to several OCPs.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anomalous intestinal microbiota development is supposedly associated with development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Our aim in this study was to identify the intestinal microbiota of patients at risk for NEC. METHODS: In a prospective trial that investigated prognostic factors for development of NEC in high-risk neonates (NTR4153), 11 NEC cases were gestational age/birthweight matched with controls (ratio of 1:2). Feces were collected twice a week. We used the first feces sample of each patient (meconium), as well as the last 2 feces samples prior to development of NEC. DNA was extracted, and the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were analyzed on a MiSeq sequencer. RESULTS: The presence and abundance of Clostridium perfringens (8.4%) and Bacteroides dorei (0.9%) in meconium were increased in neonates who developed NEC compared with controls (0.1% and 0.2%; both species, P < .001). In post-meconium samples, the abundance of staphylococci became negatively associated with NEC development (P = .1 and P = .01 for consecutive samples); Clostridium perfringens continued to be more prevalent in NEC cases. Early enteral feeding and, in particular, breast milk were correlated with an increase in lactate-producing bacilli in post-meconium samples (rho = -0.45; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: A NEC-associated gut microbiota can be identified in meconium samples; C. perfringens continues to be associated with NEC from the first meconium till just before NEC onset. In contrast, in post-meconium, increased numbers of staphylococci were negatively associated with NEC. These findings suggest causality but this causality should be verified in trials of induced infection in animals, targeted antibiotics, and/or probiotics.

The aim of this study was to investigate the most frequent etiological agents of diarrhea and its associated factors in children younger than 5 years attending the Bengo General Hospital in Angola. METHODS: From September 2012 through December 2013, stool samples were collected from 344 children presenting with diarrhea to investigate the presence of viral, bacterial and parasitic agents. Relevant sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from parents and caregivers. RESULTS: An enteric pathogen was detected in 66.6% of stool samples: Cryptosporidium spp. (30.0%), rotavirus (25.1%), Giardia lamblia (21.6%), diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (6.3%), Ascaris lumbricoides (4.1%), adenovirus (3.8%), Strongyloides stercoralis (3.5%), astrovirus (2.6%), Hymenolepis nana (1.7%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (0.9%), Taenia spp. (0.6%), Trichuris trichiura (0.3%) and Entamoeba histolytica (0.3%).

METHODS: We performed analysis of stool samples for the presence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae at 2 weeks post-natal age and 36 weeks post-menstrual age. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were characterized and typed using molecular methods. RESULTS: ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (n = 71) were isolated from 67/1229 (5.5%) infants from whom we received a sample at either sampling time or both sampling times, and from infants in 18 (75%) of the 24 recruiting NNUs. Thirty-three Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella spp. and 6 Enterobacter spp. strains were characterized. ESBL-producing E. coli were all distinguishable within individual NNUs by antibiotic resistance genotype, serogroup (O25b), phenotype, phylotype or ST. Ten of the 33 were ST131 and 9 of the 10 ST131 isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant. Seven of the 10 ST131 isolates carried genes encoding CTX-M group 1 enzymes. ST131 isolates were isolated from centres within five of the eight NNU networks. There were clusters of indistinguishable ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Enterobacter isolates associated with specific NNUs. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of E. coli ST131 were distributed across neonatal networks in the south of England. There was no evidence of clustering of clonally related ESBL-producing E. coli strains, by contrast with Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp., which did cluster within units. The possibility that ESBL-producing E. coli strains are spread by vertical transmission requires further investigation.",

DEC, investigated by PCR detection of virulence factor-encoding genes associated with the distinct pathotypes, was isolated from 18.0% of the patients, and 19.0% of the controls, with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), the most frequent pathotype, being detected in equal proportion between patients and controls (10.0%). Among the enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) isolates, only one isolate was able to produce the localized adherence pattern to HeLa cells, being thus the only typical EPEC identified. All the remaining EPEC were classified as atypical (aEPEC), and detected in 8.0% and 8.5% of the patients and controls, respectively. Regarding the serotypes, 26.5% of the analyzed EPEC isolates belonged to classical EPEC-serogroups, and the only two STEC found were serotyped as O26:H11 (patient) and O119:H7 (control). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that 43.6%, 29.5% and 2.6% of the DEC isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and gentamicin, respectively.

Immunoblot revealed that six persons (1.6%) were seropositive with the same antigens. Among 61 epileptic patients, only one was seropositive by immunoblot and the study did not find any statistically significant difference (P>0.05) in seropositivity to T. solium between epileptic persons (1/61, 1.6%) and non-epileptic group (5/323, 1.5%). In addition, cysticercosis was associated with households eating pork meat from pigs slaughtered at home, but not with other factors. The risk factors including pig farming, the consumption of pork meat, vegetables, and non-drinkable water were attenuated by the relatively good hygiene and pig husbandry practices of the population. No egg of Taenia was found in stool by microscopic examination. All data obtained in this study suggested that cysticercosis might not be the principal causative agent of epilepsy in this area.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential colonization of nosocomial bacteria in enteral feeding systems and its effect on early gut colonization of preterm neonates. METHODS: Mother's own milk, donor milk, and preterm formula samples obtained after passing through the external part of the enteral feeding tubes were cultured. In addition, meconium and fecal samples from 26 preterm infants collected at different time points until discharge were cultured. Random amplification polymorphism DNA and pulse field gel electrophoresis were performed to confirm the presence of specific bacterial strains in milk and infant fecal samples. RESULTS: Approximately 4000 bacterial isolates were identified at the species level. The dominant species in both feces from preterm infants and milk samples were Staphylococcus epidermidis, S aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E faecium, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. All of them were present at high concentrations independently of the feeding mode. Random amplification polymorphism DNA and pulse field gel electrophoresis techniques showed that several bacteria strains were found in both type of samples. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of a dense bacterial biofilm in several parts of the feeding tubes and the tube connectors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a sharing of bacterial strains between the neonates' gastrointestinal microbiota and the feeding tubes used to feed them.",

			"abstract": "Globally, diarrhoeal diseases are the second leading cause of death among children under 5 years old. Few case-control studies on the aetiology of diarrhoea have been conducted in China. A case-control study on 922 children under 5 years old who presented with diarrhoea and individually matched controls was conducted in China between May 2011 and January 2013. Quantitative PCR was used to analyze stool samples for 10 diarrhoeal pathogens. Potential enteric pathogens were detected in 377 (81.8%) of 461 children with diarrhoea and 215 controls (46.6%, p <0.001). Rotavirus, norovirus GII, Shigella and adenovirus were qualitatively associated with diarrhoea. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal cutoff threshold for defining a symptomatic individual was 72, 5840, and 10(4) copies per reaction for rotavirus (odds ratio 259), norovirus GII (odds ratio 10.6) and Shigella (odds ratio 5.1). The attributable fractions were 0.18 for rotavirus, 0.08 for norovirus GII, 0.01 for Shigella and 0.04 for adenovirus. Coinfections between pathogens were common. Two pairs, rotavirus and adenovirus, and norovirus GII and Salmonella were positively associated. The co-occurrence of rotavirus and sapovirus, astrovirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni only occurred in children with disease. Coinfection was not correlated with clinical symptoms. Quantitative data are critical. Our results indicate that increased pathogen loads increase the OR between diarrhoea and rotavirus, norovirus GII and Shigella. Coinfections with rotavirus and norovirus GII are common and occur in a nonrandom distribution. Despite testing for ten diarrhoeal pathogens, over two-thirds of cases do not have a recognized attributable cause.",

			"article_name": "A sensitive bacterial-growth-based test reveals how intestinal Bacteroides meet their porphyrin requirement.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bacteroides sp. are dominant constituents of the human and animal intestinal microbiota require porphyrins (i.e., protoporphyrin IX or iron-charged heme) for normal growth. The highly stimulatory effect of porphyrins on Bacteroides growth lead us to propose their use as a potential determinant of bacterial colonization. However, showing a role for porphryins would require sensitive detection methods that work in complex samples such as feces. RESULTS: We devised a highly sensitive semi-quantitative porphyrin detection method (detection limit 1-4 ng heme or PPIX) that can be used to assay pure or complex biological samples, based on Bacteroides growth stimulation. The test revealed that healthy colonized or non-colonized murine and human hosts provide porphyrins in feces, which stimulate Bacteroides growth. In addition, a common microbiota constituent, Escherichia coli, is shown to be a porphyrin donor, suggesting a novel basis for intestinal bacterial interactions. CONCLUSIONS: A highly sensitive method to detect porphyrins based on bacterial growth is devised and is functional in complex biological samples. Host feces, independently of their microbiota, and E. coli, which are present in the intestine, are shown to be porphryin donors. The role of porphyrins as key bioactive molecules can now be assessed for their impact on Bacteroides and other bacterial populations in the gut.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance has been referred to as 'the greatest malice of the 21st century' and a global action plan was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2015. There is a wealth of independent studies regarding antibiotics and resistant bacteria in humans, animals and their environment, however, integrated studies are lacking, particularly ones that simultaneously also take into consideration the health related behaviour of participants and healthcare providers. Such, 'One health' studies are difficult to implement, because of the complex teamwork that they entail. This paper describes the protocol of a study that investigates 'One health' issues regarding antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in children and their environment in Indian villages. METHODS/DESIGN: Both quantitative and qualitative studies are planned for a cohort of children, from 6 villages, and their surrounding environment. Repeated or continues data collection is planned over 2 years for quantitative studies. Qualitative studies will be conducted once. Studies include parents' health seeking behavior for their children (1-3 years of age at the onset), prescribing pattern of formal and informal healthcare providers, analysis of phenotypic antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli from samples of stool from children and village animals, household drinking water, village source water and waste water, and investigation on molecular mechanisms governing resistance. Analysis of interrelationship of these with each other will also be done as basis for future interventions. Ethics approval has been obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee R.D. Gardi Medical College, Ujjain, India (No: 2013/07/17-311). DISCUSSION: The findings of the study presented in this protocol will add to our knowledge about the multi-factorial nature of causes governing antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance from a 'One health' perspective. Our study will be the first of its kind addressing antibiotic use and resistance issues related to children in a One-health approach, particularly for rural India.",

We investigated the prevalence, concentration and genetic diversity of C. difficile on the carcasses (n = 300) and in the faeces (n = 30) of neonatal veal calves at three abattoirs in Australia in 2013. Selective culture (both direct and enrichment) was performed, and all isolates were characterized by PCR for the toxin genes tcdA, tcdB and cdtA/B and by PCR ribotyping. Prevalence of C. difficile was 25.3% (76/300) on carcasses and 60.0% (18/30) in faeces. Multiple PCR ribotypes (RT) were detected, with four binary toxin-positive RTs accounting for 70.3% (71/101) of isolates; 127 (A(+), B(+), CDT(+), 32.7%), 288 (A(-), B(-), CDT(+), 28.7%), 033 (A(-), B(-), CDT(+), 6.9%) and 126 (A(+), B(+), CDT(+), 2.0%). Viable counts of a subset of samples revealed detectable numbers of C. difficile in 66.7% (10/15) of faecal samples (range 2.0 x 10(3) to 2.3 x 10(6) CFU/mL, median count 2.5 x 10(4) CFU/mL) and in 16.7% (25/150) of carcase samples (range 3 to 33 CFU/cm(2), median count 7 CFU/cm(2)). These data further confirm that Australian neonatal veal calf carcasses are contaminated with potentially significant strains of C. difficile at slaughter.",

During the period from January 2005 to August 2014, SaV was detected in 30 (5.9%) of 510 gastroenteritis outbreaks in Osaka City, Japan using real-time RT-PCR. Seasonal distribution of SaV-associated outbreaks revealed an increase during the 2011-2012 season and the highest frequency of outbreaks during the 2012-2013 season. Genotyping analysis based on the capsid region demonstrated that the most common genotype was GI.2 (36.7%), in which the strains were closely related. The comparison of complete capsid gene sequences with 18 GI.2 strains (7 strains in this study and 11 from GenBank) between 1990 and 2013 showed that GI.2 strains were classified into at least three genetic clusters (1990-2000, 2004-2007, and 2008-2013) with chronologically unique amino acid residues and accumulation of mutations in the predicted P domain, suggesting the one of the causes of emergence and spread of GI.2 strains.

The wide effect of meconium on surfactant properties is divided into three points. Direct effect of meconium on surfactant properties refers mainly to fragmentation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and other surfactant phospholipids together with cleavage of surfactant proteins. Initiation of inflammatory response due to activation of receptors by yet unspecified compounds involves complement and Toll-like receptor activation. A possible role of lung collectins, surfactant proteins A and D, which can exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions, is discussed. Initiation of inflammatory response by specified compounds in meconium reflects inflammatory functioning of cytokines, bile acids, and phospholipases contained in meconium. Unifying sketch of many interconnections in all these actions aims at providing integrated picture of inflammatory surfactant inactivation.",

The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors and clinical evolution of diarrheic children </=2 years old with or without CD in their stools. METHODS: From January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013, all diarrheic stool samples received in our laboratory were screened for CD. We randomly selected diarrheic children </=2 years old (n = 100) with an isolation of toxigenic CD in the stools and compared them with diarrheic children (n = 100) without isolation of CD. RESULTS: Cases and controls were appropriately matched for age and sex. We found no significant differences between children with or without CD. Of the CD cases, we compared the patients receiving treatment with metronidazole (19%) versus those that were not prescribed treatment (81%), and found that patients in the first group had used more gastric acid suppressants (P = 0.02), had surgery in the last month (P = 0.03) and also presented with more days with diarrhea (P = 0.03). All the patients, including CD cases, independently of the administration of metronidazole, were cured of the diarrheic episode. Polymerase chain reaction-ribotyping performed in all CD cases showed that the most prevalent ribotype was 014 (25%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the nonsignificance of CD in neonates and infants younger than 2 years old. Informing clinicians of CD isolates in this population promotes the use of antibiotics against CD, without evidence of a different outcome than those not receiving treatment.",

Here, we assessed the consistency between PCR from a diagnostic laboratory, quantitative PCR (qPCR) from a research laboratory, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) for Clostridium difficile identification in diarrhea stool samples. Twenty-two C. difficile-positive diarrhea samples identified by PCR and qPCR and five C. difficile-negative diarrhea controls were studied. C. difficile was detected in 90.9% of C. difficile-positive samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and C. difficile was detected in 86.3% of C. difficile-positive samples using MSS. CFU inferred from qPCR analysis were positively correlated with the relative abundance of C. difficile from 16S rRNA gene sequencing (r(2) = -0.60) and MSS (r(2) = -0.55). C. difficile was codetected with Clostridium perfringens, norovirus, sapovirus, parechovirus, and anellovirus in 3.7% to 27.3% of the samples. A high load of Candida spp. was found in a symptomatic control sample in which no causative agents for diarrhea were identified in routine clinical testing. Beta-lactamase and tetracycline resistance genes were the most prevalent (25.9%) antibiotic resistance genes in these samples. In summary, the proof-of-concept study demonstrated that next-generation sequencing (NGS) in pathogen detection is moderately correlated with laboratory testing and is advantageous in detecting pathogens without a priori knowledge.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental factors that influence wheezing in early childhood in the developing world are not well understood and may be useful in predicting respiratory outcomes. Therefore, our objective was to determine the factors that can predict wheezing. METHODS: Children from Dhaka, Bangladesh were recruited at birth and episodes of wheezing were measured alongside nutritional, immunological and socioeconomic factors over a one-year period. Poisson Regression with variable selection was utilized to determine what factors were associated with wheezing. RESULTS: Elevated serum IL-10 (rate ratio (RR) = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.87), IL-1beta (RR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.26-1.93) C-reactive protein (CRP) (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03-1.93) in early life, and male gender (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.27-1.82) predicted increased wheezing episodes. Conversely, increased fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76-1.00) and family income (RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99) were associated with a decreased number of episodes of wheezing. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation early in life, poverty, and male sex placed infants at risk of more episodes of wheezing during their first year of life. These results support the hypothesis that there is a link between inflammation in infancy and the development of respiratory illness later in life and provide specific biomarkers that can predict wheezing in a low-income country.",

			"abstract": "In a prospective sample of 80 mother-infant dyads, we investigated whether drugs of abuse in maternal hair measured during the pregnancy trimesters were also present in neonatal meconium. Principal drugs of abuse were analyzed in the three consecutive maternal hair segments and meconium samples by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. Of the 80 mothers, 32 (40%) presented one or more hair shafts with at least one of the analyzed drugs of abuse and/or its metabolites. The drug of abuse with a higher prevalence in our study population was methamphetamine: 19 mothers had methamphetamine in one or more hair segments (59.4%). The second most detected drug of abuse was cocaine; nine mothers presented cocaine in one or more hair segments (28.1%). Nineteen pregnant women consumed at least one drug of abuse during the first trimester, ten continued consuming drugs of abuse during the second trimester; and nine consumed until the end of pregnancy. Five of the nine newborns from mothers who consumed drugs during the whole pregnancy showed drugs of abuse in meconium samples. Newborns from the 23 remaining mothers with one or two hair shafts positive to drugs of abuse did not present drugs in their meconium. Indeed from these results, it seems that discontinuous and/or sporadic consumption during pregnancy could produce a negligible transplacental passage and hence negative results in meconium. Furthermore, the role of placenta in the metabolism and excretion of drugs of abuse is still to be precisely investigated. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Compared with a non-supplemented control formula, the test formula showed a similar tolerability and supported a similar growth in healthy newborns followed for 12 weeks. The control, but not the test group, differed from the breast-fed reference group by a higher faecal pH and a significantly higher diversity of the faecal microbiota. In the test group the probiotic B. lactis increased by 100-fold in the stool and was detected in all supplemented infants.

A survey was conducted with the primary caregiver of a child under 5 years of age in 130 homes with an improved latrine in 21 villages across two provinces in Cambodia. Two focus group discussions per province were conducted after the survey to obtain caregiver feedback on new enabling products for hygienic management. Among caregivers, 63% reported child feces disposal in an improved latrine but only 36% reported doing so consistently. Besides child age, years of latrine ownership, caregiver age, consistency of adult latrine use, and presence of child feces management tools in the latrine were associated with hygienic disposal. The youngest caretakers with the newest latrines and youngest children were least likely to dispose of IYC feces hygienically, representing a key target group for interventions to improve hygienic disposal in Cambodia. Reusable diapers, child-friendly potties, and possibly latrine seats, that offer child safety, time and cost savings, and easy disposal and cleaning could potentially facilitate hygienic disposal for these ages.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Biliary atresia (BA) is a leading cause of liver failure and liver transplantation in pediatrics. BA manifests by 3 weeks of life with jaundice and pale stools. Delayed diagnosis and surgical intervention with Kasai portoenterostomy after 3 months of age is significantly associated with poor prognosis for native liver survival. A national Taiwan infant stool color card (SCC) screening program has entirely eliminated late Kasai portoenterostomy >90 days of age and improved native liver survival. A recent large-scale prospective cohort study in British Columbia, Canada, indicated that distribution of SCC on the maternity ward was feasible, led to high utilization rate, and was cost-effective. The aim of the present study was to assess the generalizability of this screening strategy in another Canadian jurisdiction with a different sociodemographic profile. METHODS: An SCC was distributed to families of newborns discharged at St Mary's Hospital Center, Montreal, Quebec. Families were instructed to monitor their infant's stool color for 21 days and then complete and mail the SCC to the study center. Phone surveys to families who did not return cards were used to estimate total card utilization rate. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred forty-six infants were eligible for inclusion; 99.9% were enrolled. Mail SCC return rate was 63.3%. No cases of BA were identified. All of the 118 families who completed the phone survey reported that they had utilized the SCC. Conservative and optimistic estimates for total card utilization rates were 82% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The high enrollment and utilization rates in this screening study strongly support the feasibility of implementing a Canadian SCC screening program to improve outcomes of children with BA.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an important cause of gastroenteritis in Japan. Although non-O157 EHEC infections have been increasingly reported worldwide, their impact on children has not been well described. METHODS: We collected national surveillance data of EHEC infections reported between 2010 and 2013 in Japan and characterized outbreaks that occurred in childcare facilities. Per Japanese outbreak investigation protocol, faecal samples from contacts of EHEC cases were collected regardless of symptomatic status. Cases and outbreaks were described by demographics, dates of diagnosis and onset, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and relation to specific outbreaks in childcare facilities. RESULTS: During 2010-2013, a total of 68 EHEC outbreaks comprised of 1035 cases were related to childcare facilities. Among the 66 outbreaks caused by a single serogroup, 29 were serogroup O26 and 22 were O157; 35 outbreaks were caused by stx1-producing strains. Since 2010, the number of reported outbreaks steadily increased, with a rise in cases and outbreaks caused by stx1-producing O26. Of 7069 EHEC cases reported nationally in 2010-2011, the majority were caused by O157 (n = 4938), relative to O26 (n = 1353) and O111 (n = 195). However, relative to 69 cases of O157 (2%) associated with childcare facility EHEC outbreaks, there were 131 (10%) such cases of O26, and this trend intensified in 2012-2013 (O157, 3%; O26, 24%; O111, 48%). Among family members of childcare facility cases, the proportion of cases that were symptomatic declined with age; 10/16 cases (63%) aged 6 years or younger, 16/53 cases (30%) 6-19 years old, 23/120 cases (19%) 20-49 years old and 2/28 cases (7%) 50 years or older were symptomatic. Thirty one of the 68 outbreaks (46%) were classified as foodborne-related. CONCLUSIONS: Childcare facility EHEC outbreaks due to non-O157 serogroups, particularly O26 and O111, increased during 2010-2013. These facilities should pay extra attention to health conditions in children. As older family members of childcare facility cases appear to be less symptomatic, they should be vigilant about hand-washing to prevent further transmission.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ingestion of probiotics to attempt to improve health is increasingly common; however, quality control of some commercial products can be limited. Clinical practice is shifting toward the routine use of probiotics to aid in prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants, and probiotic administration to term infants is increasingly common to treat colic and/or prevent atopic disease. Since bifidobacteria dominate the feces of healthy breast-fed infants, they are often included in infant-targeted probiotics. METHODS: We evaluated 16 probiotic products to determine how well their label claims describe the species of detectable bifidobacteria in the product. Recently developed DNA-based methods were used as a primary means of identification, and were confirmed using culture-based techniques. RESULTS: We found that the contents of many bifidobacterial probiotic products differ from the ingredient list, sometimes at a subspecies level. Only 1 of the 16 probiotics perfectly matched its bifidobacterial label claims in all samples tested, and both pill-to-pill and lot-to-lot variation were observed. CONCLUSION: Given the known differences between various bifidobacterial species and subspecies in metabolic capacity and colonization abilities, the prevalence of misidentified bifidobacteria in these products is cause for concern for those involved in clinical trials and consumers of probiotic products.",

			"abstract": "The composition of the gut microbiota plays a role in the development of allergies. Based on the immunomodulating capacities of bacteria, various studies have investigated the potential role for probiotics in the prevention of childhood eczema. In a previous study we have shown that significantly less children developed eczema after probiotic supplementation (Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis W52 and Lactococcus lactis W58, Ecologic((R))Panda) at three months of age as compared to controls. Here, metabolites in faecal samples of these 3-month old children were measured by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance to investigate possible gut metabolic alterations. Lower amounts of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), succinate, phenylalanine and alanine were found in faecal samples of children later developing eczema, whereas the amounts of glucose, galactose, lactate and lactose were higher compared to the children not developing eczema. Although these differences were already present at the age of 3 months, eczema did not develop in the majority of children before the age of 1 year. Supplementation of multispecies probiotics seems to induce higher levels of lactate and SCFAs, and lower levels of lactose and succinate when compared with the placebo group. This might explain the temporary preventive effect of probiotics on the development of eczema. These results highlight the role bacterial metabolites may play in development of the immune system, even before clinical manifestations of allergic disease arise.",

			"abstract": "Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in both sporadic and outbreak cases. Genotyping and recombination analyses were performed in order to help getting more knowledge of the distribution and genetic diversity of NoVs in Suzhou, located in Jiangsu province of China. All stool samples were collected from hospitalized children younger than 5 years old with acute gastroenteritis. For genotyping, the open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF2 were partially amplified and sequenced. 26.9% of stool samples were positive for genogroup II NoVs. The most common genotype was GII.4 and its variants included Den Haag-2006b, New Orleans-2009, and Sydney-2012. The Den Haag-2006b variants predominated during 2010-2012. In 2013, it was replaced by the Sydney-2012 variant. The second most common genotype was GII.12/GII.3. NoVs could be detected throughout the year, with GII.4 and GII.12/GII.3 coexisting during the cold months, and GII.4 was the main genotype during the warm months. The highest prevalence of NoV was detected in young children aged <24 months. Patients infected with GII.4 had a higher chance of getting moderate fever than other NoV-positive patients, while those infected with GII.12/GII.3 tended to have a mild degree of fever. NoV is an important pathogen responsible for viral gastroenteritis among children in Suzhou. Analyses of NoV circulating between 2010 and 2013 revealed a change of predominant variant of NoV GII.4 in each epidemic season and intergenotype recombinant strains represented an important part.",

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with the objectives of to find out the incidence of feed intolerance in vigorous neonates with MSAF who received gastric lavage (GL) as compared to those in whom it was not performed. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial on 500 neonates satisfying the inclusion criteria, 230 were allocated to GL and 270 to no lavage group through computer generated random numbers. RESULTS: No significant difference in the incidence of vomiting was found between GL and no lavage group (8.7 % vs 11.5 %, p = 0.305). Feed intolerance had no relationship with gestational age, gender, birth weight and mode of delivery. No neonates of GL group developed any complications related to the procedure. CONCLUSION: Thus, it may be concluded that gastric lavage is not required in neonates born with MSAF.",

After hair washing with methyl alcohol and diethyl ether and subsequent addition of internal standards, hair samples were treated with 500 mul VMA-T M3 reagent for 1h at 100  degrees C. After cooling, 100 mul M3 extract were diluted with 400 mul water and a volume of 10 mul was injected into chromatographic system. Meconium samples were firstly treated with 1 ml methyl alcohol and the organic layer back-extracted twice with 1.5 ml of a mixture of ethylacetate:hexane (80:20, v/v). Chromatographic separation was achieved at ambient temperature using a reverse-phase column and a linear gradient elution with two solvents: 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile and 5mM ammonium formate pH 3. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode, using multiple reaction monitoring via positive electrospray ionization. The method was linear from the limit of quantification (0.05-1 ng/mg hair and 5-25 ng/g meconium depending on analyte under investigation;) to 10 ng/mg hair and 1000 ng/g meconium, with an intra- and inter-assay imprecision and inaccuracy always less than 20% and an analytical recovery between 66.6% and 95.3%, depending on the considered analyte and biological matrix. Using the validated method, 7 mothers were found positive to one or more hair segments and 5 meconium samples were found positive to one or more antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs, assessing prenatal exposure to these drugs following maternal consumption in one or more pregnancy trimesters.",

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of women with MSAF during labor who delivered in a tertiary hospital at 37 to 41(+6) weeks of gestation (2007-2013). Exclusion criteria included: multiple gestations, noncephalic presentation, fetal structural/chromosomal anomalies, hypertensive disorders, diabetes, oligohydramnios, or small for gestational age. Pregnancy outcome of women with MSAF (N = 4,893) was compared with a control group of women without MSAF (N = 39,651). Neonatal respiratory morbidity was defined as the presence of any of the following: respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome, or need for ventilatory support. RESULTS: Overall, 10.9% of low-risk pregnancies at term were diagnosed with MSAF. Compared with the controls, women with MSAF had higher rates of nulliparity, gestational age at delivery >/= 41 weeks, induction of labor, nonreassuring fetal heart rate, and operative deliveries. In multivariate analysis MSAF was associated with operative delivery (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-2.09; p < 0.001), cesarean section (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.69; p < 0.001), respiratory morbidity (OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 3.87-5.82; p < 0.001), and increased risk for short-term neonatal morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: MSAF is associated with a higher rate of adverse perinatal outcome even in low-risk pregnancies at term.",

A total of 488 fecal specimens from diarrheic and non-diarrheic children were obtained between January and December 2012. RVA detection was initially performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, followed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers. RVA was detected in 18.3% (44/241) of the children with acute diarrhea and in 1.2% (3/247) of the non-diarrheic children (P < 0.001), with overall RVA-positivity of 9.6% (47/488). The most common genotype was G2P[4] with 43.2% (19/44) of the diarrheic cases, followed by G12P[8] (27.3%, 12/44), G3P[6] (18.2%, 8/44), G3P[8] (4.5%, 2/44), and G12P[6] (2.3%, 1/44). G12 samples belonged to lineage III and were from children aged 4-52 months. All of these children had acute diarrhea associated with fever (83.3%, 10/12) and vomiting (66.7%, 8/12). Most of the cases occurred in August (58.3%, 7/12), 75% (9/12) of which having received the full vaccination scheme with Rotarix. For the first time G12 was reported at relative high prevalence in Brazil. Our findings warrant further monitoring studies on the molecular characterization of circulating RVA strains after rotavirus vaccine introduction in Brazil and elsewhere, since the occurrence of either unusual our emerging genotypes may pose a challenge to vaccination strategies.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Entamoeba histolytica, E. dispar and E. moshkovskii are the most frequent species described in human infection where E. histolytica is the only true pathogen. The epidemiology of this infection is complex due to the absence of a routine exam that allows a correct discrimination of the Entamoeba species complex. Therefore, molecular methods appear as the unique epidemiological tool to accomplish the species discrimination. Herein, we conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the frequency of Entamoeba species infections in a group of asymptomatic individuals from a rural area in central Colombia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 181 fecal samples from asymptomatic children under 16 years old from the hamlet La Virgen, Cundinamarca (Colombia) that voluntarily accepted to participate in the study were collected. The fecal samples were examined by light microscopy and DNA-extracted, subsequently submitted to molecular discrimination of E. dispar/E. histolytica/E. moshkovskii infection based on a multiplex PCR assay targeting the 18S rRNA fragment. To confirm the species description, twenty samples were randomly submitted to DNA sequencing of the aforementioned fragment. By direct microscopic examination, frequency of the complex E. histolytica/E. dispar/E. moshkovskii was 18.8% (34/181). PCR showed a frequency of 49.1% (89/181), discriminated as 23.2% (42/181) that were positive for E. dispar, 25.4% (46/181) for E. moshkovskii and 0.55% (1/ 181) for E. histolytica. Also, mixed infections were detected between E. dispar and E. moshkovskii at 4.42% (8/181) of the samples. Molecular barcoding confirmed the diagnosis depicted by the multiplex PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first description of E. moshkovskii in Colombia and the second report in South-America to our knowledge. Our results suggest the need to unravel the true epidemiology of Entamoeba infections around the world, including the real pathogenic role that E. moshkovskii may have.",

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia among young children in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and identify risk factors for infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed an unmatched case-control study among children < 2 years of age in Dar es Salaam, recruited from August 2010 to July 2011. Detection and identification of protozoans were done by PCR techniques on DNA from stool specimens from 701 cases of children admitted due to diarrhea at the three study hospitals, and 558 controls of children with no history of diarrhea during the last month prior to enrollment. The prevalence of C. parvum/hominis was 10.4% (84.7% C. hominis), and that of G. lamblia 4.6%. E. histolytica was not detected. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium was significantly higher in cases (16.3%) than in controls (3.1%; P < 0.001; OR = 6.2; 95% CI: 3.7-10.4). G. lamblia was significantly more prevalent in controls (6.1%) than in cases (3.4%; P = 0.027; OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-3.1). Cryptosporidium infection was found more often in HIV-positive (24.2%) than in HIV-negative children (3.9%; P < 0.001; OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 3.1-20.5), and was also associated with rainfall (P < 0.001; OR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.5-3.8). Among cases, stunted children had significantly higher risk of being infected with Cryptosporidium (P = 0.011; OR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.2-3.8). G. lamblia infection was more prevalent in the cool season (P = 0.004; OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.8), and more frequent among cases aged > 12 months (P = 0.003; OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.5-7.8). Among children aged 7-12 months, those who were breastfed had lower prevalence of G. lamblia infection than those who had been weaned (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium infection is common among young Tanzanian children with diarrhea, particularly those living with HIV, and infection is more frequent during the rainy season. G. lamblia is frequently implicated in asymptomatic infections, but rarely causes overt diarrheal illness, and its prevalence increases with age.",

We aimed to study the molecular prevalence and seasonality of Cryptosporidium over a period of 1 year in a cohort of Egyptian diarrhoeic patients. Stool samples were collected from 865 diarrhoeic patients attending outpatient clinics of Cairo University hospitals, from all age groups over a 12-month period, examined microscopically for faecal Cryptosporidium oocysts by the acid-fast staining method and for copro-DNA detection using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assays. PCR-positive samples were characterised molecularly by nPCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to determine Cryptosporidium genotypes. Cryptosporidium copro-DNA was detected in 19.5% of the collected samples throughout the year, with a major peak in summer (August) and a small rise in spring (April). Infection was mainly C. hominis (95.8%) followed by C. parvum (3.0%), affecting all age groups, with predominance in the pre-school age group, and decrease with age. There were statistically significant associations between the detection of Cryptosporidium and season, diarrhoea, patient age and drinking water, while gender, contact with animals and presence of mucus in stool showed no association. Cryptosporidium in diarrhoeic Egyptians was of distinct endemicity, with the bi-model mostly influenced by population dynamics, with a clear high prevalence in pre-school children and predominating anthroponotic (C. hominis) transmission throughout the year. The obtained results highlight Cryptosporidium as a water contaminant and an important cause of health problems in Egypt, necessitating further studies of the risk factors.",

Recent studies have reported that plasma citrulline levels correlate with functional enterocyte mass. AIMS: This study aimed to determine the normal dried blood spot (DBS) citrulline levels and to determine the existence of a correlation between citrulline levels and meconium obstruction of prematurity (MOP). STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A retrospective cohort study was performed involving 285 infants born at less than 32weeks gestation who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between Oct 2009 and Aug 2014. OUTCOME MEASURES: We analyzed the DBS citrulline levels, which are routinely measured via newborn screening at 7days following birth, using liquid chromatography-MS/MS. We investigated the relationship between DBS citrulline levels and clinical parameters such as gestational age (GA), body measurements at birth, gender, or the presence or absence of either necrotizing enterocolitis or MOP. RESULTS: A total of 229 infants with a median GA of 29.6weeks and a median birth weight of 1160g were included. DBS citrulline levels were not associated with GA, body measurements at birth or gender. DBS citrulline levels were significantly decreased when patients presented with MOP (p=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Early DBS citrulline levels were not associated with either GA or body measurements at birth but were reduced among preterm infants with MOP compared with the control infants. These results may be indicative of abnormal fetal intestinal development and reduced functional enterocyte mass among preterm infants with MOP.",

			"article_name": "Glycerin laxatives for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in very low birth weight infants.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Feeding intolerance is a common clinical problem among preterm infants. It may be an early sign of necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis or other serious gastrointestinal conditions, or it may result from gut immaturity with delayed passage of meconium. Glycerin laxatives stimulate passage of meconium by acting as an osmotic dehydrating agent and increasing osmotic pressure in the gut; they stimulate rectal contraction, potentially reducing the incidence of feeding intolerance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of glycerin laxatives (enemas/suppositories) for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We restricted our search to all randomised controlled trials and applied no language restrictions. We searched the references of identified studies and reviews on this topic and handsearched for additional articles. We searched the database maintained by the US National Institutes of Health (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and European trial registries to identify ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered only randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that enrolled preterm infants < 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) and/or < 1500 g birth weight. We included trials if they administered glycerin laxatives and measured at least one prespecified clinical outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Group to assess methodological quality of trials, to collect data and to perform analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three trials that evaluated use of prophylactic glycerin laxatives in preterm infants. We identified no trials that evaluated therapeutic use of glycerin laxatives for feeding intolerance. Our review showed that prophylactic administration of glycerin laxatives did not reduce the time required to achieve full enteral feeds and did not influence secondary outcomes, including duration of hospital stay, mortality and weight at discharge. Prophylactic administration of glycerin laxatives resulted in failure of fewer infants to pass stool over the first 48 hours. Included trials reported no adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review of available evidence for glycerin laxatives does not support the routine use of prophylactic glycerin laxatives in clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to confirm or refute the effectiveness and safety of glycerin laxatives for prevention or treatment of feeding intolerance in VLBW infants.",

			"abstract": "Norovirus (NV) is an important cause of acute gastroenteritis in children, but is also frequently detected in asymptomatic children, which complicates the interpretation of NV detection results in both the clinical setting and population prevalence studies. A total of 807 faecal samples from children aged <5 years hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis were collected in Thai Binh, Vietnam, from January 2011 to September 2012. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect and quantify NV-RNA in clinical samples. A bimodal distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) values was observed in which the lower peak was assumed to represent cases for which NV was the causal agent of diarrhoea, whereas the higher peak was assumed to represent cases involving an alternative pathogen other than NV. Under these assumptions, we applied finite-mixture modelling to estimate a threshold of Ct <21.36 (95% confidence interval 20.29-22.46) to distinguish NV-positive patients for which NV was the likely cause of diarrhoea. We evaluated the validity of the threshold through comparisons with NV antigen ELISA results, and comparisons of Ct values in patients co-infected with rotavirus. We conclude that the use of an appropriate cut-off value in the interpretation of NV real-time RT-PCR results may improve differential diagnosis of enteric infections, and could contribute to improved estimates of the burden of NV disease.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a small virus belongs to Anelloviridea family. TTV is a disease orphan virus but it has often been associated with a variety of pathologies and co-infections. TTV was recently identified as an infectious agent that could potentially be involved in cases of acute enteritis. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the presence of TTV in stools from diarrheic and not diarrheic people, and to investigate an association between infection, and patient age and gender. STUDY DESIGN: Stool samples from people exhibiting signs of enteritis (954) and from non-diarrheic individuals (76) were collected in the former Chinook Health Region (CHR) in Southwestern Alberta, Canada from May 2008 to April 2009. Viral genetic material was extracted, and detection and quantification of TTV were carried out by real-time PCR. The presence of other viral and bacterial enteric pathogens was also investigated. RESULTS: More (P<0.001) diarrheic people (38.8%) tested positive for TTV DNA than non-diarrheic individuals (18.4%). Furthermore, viral load was greater (P<0.001) in stools from diarrheic (2.0x10(7)copies/g) than non-diarrheic (2.0x10(3)copies/g) people. TTV DNA was detected most often in diarrheic individuals that were 0-5 (57.3%) and greater than 81 (59.0%) years of age. Combined across age, the prevalence of TTV was higher among men than women (P=0.003). Co-infections with other enteric pathogens were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a significant association between TTV prevalence and viral load, and enteritis. Also, TTV prevalence was significantly higher in the very young and elderly suggesting that immunological status is important.",

			"article_name": "Epidemiologic Association Between FUT2 Secretor Status and Severe Rotavirus Gastroenteritis in Children in the United States.",
			"abstract": "IMPORTANCE: A genetic polymorphism affecting FUT2 secretor status in approximately one-quarter of humans of European descent affects the expression of histo-blood group antigens on the mucosal epithelia of human respiratory, genitourinary, and digestive tracts. These histo-blood group antigens serve as host receptor sites necessary for attachment and infection of some pathogens, including norovirus. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether an association exists between FUT2 secretor status and laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections in US children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter case-control observational study involving active surveillance at 6 US pediatric medical institutions in the inpatient and emergency department clinical settings. We enrolled 1564 children younger than 5 years with acute gastroenteritis (diarrhea and/or vomiting) and 818 healthy controls frequency matched by age and month, from December 1, 2011, through March 31, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Paired fecal-saliva specimens were tested for rotavirus and for secretor status. Comparisons were made between rotavirus test-positive cases and healthy controls stratified by ethnicity and vaccination status. Adjusted multivariable analyses assessed the preventive association of secretor status against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. RESULTS: One (0.5%) of 189 rotavirus test-positive cases was a nonsecretor, compared with 188 (23%) of 818 healthy control participants (P < .001). Healthy control participants of Hispanic ethnicity were significantly less likely to be nonsecretors (13%) compared with healthy children who were not of Hispanic ethnicity (25%) (P < .001). After controlling for vaccination and other factors, children with the nonsecretor FUT2 polymorphism appeared statistically protected (98% [95% CI, 84%-100%]) against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was virtually absent among US children who had a genetic polymorphism that inactivates FUT2 expression on the intestinal epithelium. We observed a strong epidemiologic association among children with rotavirus gastroenteritis compared with healthy control participants. The exact cellular mechanism behind this epidemiologic association remains unclear, but evidence suggests that it may be rotavirus genotype specific. The lower prevalence of nonsecretors among Hispanic children may translate to an enhanced burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis among this group. Our findings may have bearing on our full understanding of rotavirus infections and the effects of vaccination in diverse populations.",

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of severe diarrhea caused by rotavirus A (RVA) and Adenovirus serotype 40 and 41 in Congolese children hospitalized with severe gastroenteritis. Stool samples were collected from 655 Congolese children less than 60 months of age hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis between June 2012 and June 2013. Rotavirus and adenovirus antigens were tested using commercially available ELISA kits and the RVA G- and P- genotypes were identified by seminested multiplex RT-PCR. Three hundred and four (46.4%) children were tested positive for RVA. Adenovirus infection was found in 5.5% of the 564 tested children. Rotavirus infection was frequently observed in children between 6-12 months (55.9%). The dry season months recorded increased RVA infection while no seasonality of adenovirus infection was demonstrated. The most common RVA genotypes were G1 (57.5%), G2 (6.4%), G1G2 mixture (15.5%), P[8] (58%), P[6] (13.2%), and P[8]P[6] mixture (26%). Additionally, the genotype G12P[6] was significantly associated with increased vomiting. This first study on Congolese children demonstrates a high prevalence and clinical significance of existing rotavirus genotypes. Adenovirus prevalence is similar to that of other Central African countries. This baseline epidemiology and molecular characterization study will contribute significantly to the RVA surveillance after vaccine implementation in the country.",

Recently, a second type of SaV-A, SaV-A2, was identified in a sewage sample from Bangkok, Thailand. No information is available on the prevalence of SaV-A in Western Europe. OBJECTIVES: Stool samples from patients with symptoms of acute viral gastroenteritis were analyzed for SaV-A and the clinical course of SaV-A-positive individuals was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 3019 fecal samples collected during 2012-2013 from 1941 hospitalized patients with acute gastroenteritis were screened for SaV-A by a newly designed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting a conserved sequence in the 5'-untranslated region. Positive results were verified by sequencing the viral capsid protein 1 gene also allowing typing of the virus. Medical records of SaV-A-infected patients were reviewed for clinical features and laboratory data. RESULTS: SaV-A was detected in five patients. Viral RNA concentrations ranged from 7.1x10(6) to 7.2x10(8)copies/g feces. The viruses from four patients were classified as SaV-A1 while SaV-A2 was present in one patient. After reviewing the medical records, SaV-A could not be considered as the sole possible cause of gastroenteritis symptoms given the presence of other plausible causes in all five patients. CONCLUSION: SaV-A infection can be detected in Germany, Western Europe, albeit at low levels. The detection of SaV-A2 in Europe suggests wider spread of SaV-A2. Presence of SaV-A, even at high concentrations, in a stool sample provides no conclusive evidence that SaV is the major cause of the patient's gastroenteritis symptoms.",

Stool samples collected from outpatients with clinical symptoms of acute gastroenteritis in all age groups at the First People's Hospital in Huzhou, Huzhou, China between March 2014 and February 2015 were analyzed to gain insight into the epidemiology and genetic variation in NoV strains circulating in China. METHOD: Real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed for Norovirus detection. RT-PCR were used for genomic amplification and sequencing. Genogroup and genotype were assigned using the NoV Noronet typing tool and the strains were named according to the time of isolation. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA 5. RESULTS: Of the 809 specimens, 193 (23.9 %) were positive for NoV, with GII.4 and GII.17 the most commonly identified strains. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of five recombinant strains in Huzhou. Recombinants GII.P13/GII.17 and GII.P12/GII.4 were newly detected in China. The GII.P13/GII.17 recombinant was first identified in October 2014 and steadily replaced GII.Pe/GII.4 (GII.4 Sydney 2012) as the predominant circulating NoV genotype. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of the detection of GII.17 in the Huzhou area and of a NoV genotype being detected in greater numbers than GII.4. Furthermore, our results indicated that following the emergence of GII.17 in October 2014, it steadily replaced the previous circulating GII.4 Sydney2012 strain, which was the dominant circulating genotype for the past 2 years. As norovirus are the important cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis, continuous and comprehensive study of the norovirus strains involved in large and cost-effective acute gastroenteritis would help understanding the molecular epidemiology of norovirus infections and development of improved prevention and control measures.",

In 2014, we detected HPeV from 38 patients by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in Osaka City, Japan, and 33 HPeV strains were genotyped based on their VP1 sequences. HPeV genotype 3 (HPeV-3) was the most prevalent and accounted for 22 cases (66.7%) followed by nine HPeV-1 (27.3%), one HPeV-2 (3.0%) and one HPeV-4 (3.0%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that detected HPeV-3 strains were divided into three genetically distinct groups. One was characterized by a novel single amino acid deletion mutation at the N terminus of the 2A protein as well as the VP1 sequence, whereas the others were closely related to HPeV-3 strains detected in Japan in either 2008 or 2011. These HPeV-3 groups were detected from patients with various symptoms including three myositis cases. Recent papers have demonstrated that HPeV-3 was the aetiological agent for epidemic myalgia exclusively among adults from Yamagata Prefecture in Japan. Here, we provide clinical details and episodes of three myositis patients including an adult and two children in Osaka City, Japan. Our results suggest that HPeV-3 is a causative agent of myositis not only in adults but also in children.",

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases and major pediatric conference proceedings were searched. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1326 infants met the inclusion criteria. Compared with standard formula, the use of fermented formula resulted in a similar weight gain and length gain during the study period. Data from one RCT, albeit large, suggest the effectiveness of fermented formula in preventing and treating acute diarrhea. Fermented formula has the potential to reduce some, albeit not well-defined, digestive symptoms. Current evidence does not support the use of fermented formula for preventing cow's milk allergy.

			"article_name": "High frequencies of antibiotic resistance genes in infants' meconium and early fecal samples.",
			"abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota has been identified as an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that can be horizontally transferred to pathogenic species. Maternal GIT microbes can be transmitted to the offspring, and recent work indicates that such transfer starts before birth. We have used culture-independent genetic screenings to explore whether ARGs are already present in the meconium accumulated in the GIT during fetal life and in feces of 1-week-old infants. We have analyzed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (BLr) and tetracycline (Tcr), screening for a variety of genes conferring each. To evaluate whether ARGs could have been inherited by maternal transmission, we have screened perinatal fecal samples of the 1-week-old babies' mothers, as well as a mother-infant series including meconium, fecal samples collected through the infant's 1st year, maternal fecal samples and colostrum. Our results reveal a high prevalence of BLr and Tcr in both meconium and early fecal samples, implying that the GIT resistance reservoir starts to accumulate even before birth. We show that ARGs present in the mother may reach the meconium and colostrum and establish in the infant GIT, but also that some ARGs were likely acquired from other sources. Alarmingly, we identified in both meconium and 1-week-olds' samples a particularly elevated prevalence of mecA (>45%), six-fold higher than that detected in the mothers. The mecA gene confers BLr to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and although its detection does not imply the presence of this pathogen, it does implicate the young infant's GIT as a noteworthy reservoir of this gene.",

We investigated whether EtG in maternal hair measured during the three trimesters of pregnancy correlated with EtG and FAEEs in neonatal meconium. METHODS: In a prospective sample of 80 mother-infant dyads from Barcelona (Spain), we measured EtG and FAEE in maternal hair segments and meconium samples using a validated UHPLC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: Fifty-eight (72.5%) women had EtG concentrations in the hair shafts >7 pg/mg in one or more pregnancy trimesters, and EtG and FAEEs in meconium samples were documented in 50 and 24 of their neonates, respectively. The best significant correlations (p<0.0001) were found between EtG concentration in the proximal 0-3 and 3-6 hair shaft segments corresponding to the last two pregnancy trimesters and EtG in neonatal meconium (rho=0.609 and rho=0.577, respectively). Using the combination of EtG in meconium >/=30 ng/g and a median of EtG >11 pg/mg in maternal hair during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, prenatal ethanol exposure could be predicted with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 73.7%.

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Palmitic acid (PA) comprises 17% to 25% of human milk fatty acids, of which 70% to 75% are esterified to the SN2 position of the triglyceride (SN2-palmitate). In vegetable oils, which are commonly used in infant formulas, palmitate is primarily esterified to other positions, resulting in reduced calcium and fat absorption and hard stools. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of SN2-palmitate on nutrient excretion. METHODS: In total, 171 Chinese infants were included (within 14 days of birth) in this multicenter study. Formula-fed infants were randomly assigned to receive either SN2-palmitate formula (INFAT, n = 57) or control formula (n = 57). The formulas (Biostime, China) differed only in their SN2 PA proportions. Stool was collected at 6 postnatal weeks. RESULTS: The stool dry weight and fat content of the SN2-palmitate group were lower compared with the control group (dry weight 4.25 g vs 7.28 g, P < 0.05; fat 0.8 g vs 1.2 g, P < 0.05). The lipid component was also significantly lower for the SN2-palmitate group (0.79 g vs 1.19 g, P < 0.05). PA, representing  approximately 50% of the saponified fatty acids, was significantly lower in the SN2-palmitate group compared with the control group (0.3 g vs 0.7 g, P < 0.01). Breast-fed infants had a significantly lower stool dry weight, fat content, and saponified fat excretion compared with formula-fed infants (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to breast milk, the SN2-palmitate infant formula primarily reduced calcium-saponified fat excretion. The results of this study further emphasize the nutritional importance of SN2-palmitate structured fat for infants.",

Faecal samples from 120 healthy pregnant mothers within 1 month of delivery and from their infants at 1 month of age and 98 vaginal swabs from the mothers at the time of delivery were collected at a maternity hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The faecal and vaginal samples were assayed by real-time PCR assays to detect Bifidobacterium species and to estimate the bifidobacterial copy numbers. After adjusting for the numbers of each Bifidobacterium species, delivery mode, and antibiotic use in infants by the age of 1 month, total counts of bifidobacteria in the mothers' faeces were associated with increased copy numbers of bifidobacteria in the faeces of breastfed infants. A caesarean section was also significantly associated with a decrease in the copy numbers of bifidobacteria in the faeces of infants. No significant correlation was found between the bifidobacterial copies of the vaginal swabs and those of the infants' faeces. The intestinal bifidobacterial status of exclusively breastfed infants was significantly positive affected by vaginal delivery and high bifidobacterial copy numbers in their mothers' gut.",

In response to the wild poliovirus outbreak in Syria 2013 and high number of refugees coming from Syria to Germany, stool samples from 629 Syrian refugees/asylum seekers aged <3 years were screened for wild poliovirus between November 2013 and April 2014. Ninety-three samples (14.8%) were positive in an enterovirus specific PCR. Of these, 12 contained Sabin-like polioviruses. The remaining 81 samples were characterized as non-polio enteroviruses representing several members of groups A-C as well as rhinovirus. Wild-type poliovirus was not detected via stool screening involving molecular and virological methods, indicating a very low risk for the importation by Syrian refugees and asylum seekers at that time.",

Little is known about the source of HPeV3 infection. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the source of HPeV3 infection and the role of asymptomatic children in the families of infected children. STUDY DESIGN: During a 2014 HPeV3 epidemic in Niigata, Japan, we analyzed (1) clinical information on sick contacts for 43 neonates and young infants with HPeV3-related disease diagnosed by PCR analysis of serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid and (2) stool samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings/cousins of index patients. To confirm transmission, the P1 (VP0, VP3, and VP1) and 3D(pol) regions of HPeVs were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: Sick contact with family members was confirmed for 51% (n=22) of patients. Among the 30 symptomatic family members, 67% (n=20) were siblings, 20% (n=6) were mothers, and 13% (n=4) were other relatives. Stool samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings/cousins of 4 HPeV3-infected patients yielded positive results for HPeVs on PCR analysis. Furthermore, the P1 and 3D(pol) nucleotide sequences of family members were 100% identical to those of the respective index cases. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of genetically identical virus from HPeV3-infected patients and asymptomatic children in their families suggests that the latter are a source of infection in neonates and young infants with HPeV3-related diseases.",

We evaluated serum antibody response to Cryptosporidium gp15 in 150 sets of maternal, preweaning and postinfection/end-of-follow-up sera from children followed up to 2 years of age to determine the influence of maternal and preweaning serological status on childhood cryptosporidiosis. Fifty two percent (N = 78) of mothers and 20% (N = 30) of children were seropositive preweaning. However, most positive preweaning samples from children were collected early in life indicating transplacental transfer and subsequent rapid waning of antibodies. Although 62% (N = 94) of children had a parasitologically confirmed cryptosporidial infection (detected by stool polymerase chain reaction) during the follow-up, only 54% (N = 51) of children were seropositive postinfection. Given there were striking differences in seropositivity depending on when the sample was collected, even though Cryptosporidium was detected in the stool of the majority of the children, this study indicates that antibodies wane rapidly. During follow-up, the acquisition or severity of cryptosporidial infections was not influenced by maternal (P = 0.331 and 0.720, respectively) as well as the preweaning serological status of the child (P = 0.076 and 0.196, respectively).",

As advanced methods, reagents, and disposal kits for detecting and identifying pathogens become commercially available, it is important to test them in settings other than in laboratories with \"state-of-the-art\" equipment and well-trained staff members. In the present study, we sought to detect microsporidia DNA preserved and extracted from FTA (fast technology analysis) cards spotted with human fecal suspensions obtained from Cameroonian volunteers living in the capital city of Yaounde to preclude the need for employing spore-concentrating protocols. Further, we tested whether amplicon nucleotide sequencing approaches could be used on small aliquots taken from the cards to elucidate the diversity of microsporidia species and strains infecting native residents. Of 196 samples analyzed, 12 (6.1%) were positive for microsporidia DNA; Enterocytozoon bieneusi (Type IV and KIN-1), Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. These data demonstrate the utility of the FTA cards in identifying genotypes of microsporidia DNA in human fecal samples that may be applied to field testing for prevalence studies.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea still accounts for considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide. The highest burden is concentrated in tropical areas where populations lack access to clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene. In contrast to acute diarrhoea (<14 days), the spectrum of pathogens that may give rise to persistent diarrhoea (>/=14 days) and persistent abdominal pain is poorly understood. It is conceivable that pathogens causing neglected tropical diseases play a major role, but few studies investigated this issue. Clinical management and diagnostic work-up of persistent digestive disorders in the tropics therefore remain inadequate. Hence, important aspects regarding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical symptomatology and treatment options for patients presenting with persistent diarrhoea and persistent abdominal pain should be investigated in multi-centric clinical studies. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-country, prospective, non-experimental case-control study will assess persistent diarrhoea (>/=14 days; in individuals aged >/=1 year) and persistent abdominal pain (>/=14 days; in children/adolescents aged 1-18 years) in up to 2000 symptomatic patients and 2000 matched controls. Subjects from Cote d'Ivoire, Indonesia, Mali and Nepal will be clinically examined and interviewed using a detailed case report form. Additionally, each participant will provide a stool sample that will be examined using a suite of diagnostic methods (i.e., microscopic techniques, rapid diagnostic tests, stool culture and polymerase chain reaction) for the presence of bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Treatment will be offered to all infected participants and the clinical treatment response will be recorded. Data obtained will be utilised to develop patient-centred clinical algorithms that will be validated in primary health care centres in the four study countries in subsequent studies. DISCUSSION: Our research will deepen the understanding of the importance of persistent diarrhoea and related digestive disorders in the tropics. A diversity of intestinal pathogens will be assessed for potential associations with persistent diarrhoea and persistent abdominal pain. Different diagnostic methods will be compared, clinical symptoms investigated and diagnosis-treatment algorithms developed for validation in selected primary health care centres. The findings from this study will improve differential diagnosis and evidence-based clinical management of digestive syndromes in the tropics.

			"article_name": "Factors Determining Optimal Fatty Acid Absorption in Preterm Infants.",
			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to quantify absorption coefficients of specific fatty acids in preterm infants as a function of diet, formula or breast milk (BM), and postnatal age; to identify the fatty acid structural characteristics that determine optimal fatty acid absorption. METHODS: Fatty acids from dietary and fecal samples were extracted and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Fatty acid absorption coefficients (FA-CFAs) were calculated by comparing the total amount of fatty acids supplied by the diet to the amount quantified in the total fecal output during a 3-day period. RESULTS: A total of 18 infants (BM 8, formula 10) were studied at 2 weeks of age, and 20 infants (BM 10, formula 10) were studied at 6 weeks of age. FA-CFAs decreased with increasing carbon length in formula-fed infants at 2 and 6 weeks. Results were similar but less in magnitude in BM-fed infants at 2 weeks with no difference at 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants fed formula demonstrated lower FA-CFAs as a function of increasing carbon length. This is consistent with limited pancreatic lipase production and with lipase being present in BM but not in formula. The fact that this pattern was seen in BM-fed infants at 2 weeks but not 6 weeks of age suggests that intestinal immaturity may also play a role in impaired fatty acid absorption. These data highlight principles that need to be considered to optimize delivery and absorption of dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in preterm infants.",

Although current evidence would suggest that bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC, no single bacterium has yet been identified. AIMS: The aims of this study were to investigate fecal S100A12 concentrations and the intestinal bacterial community in premature infants (24-32 weeks) and investigate any associations between the microbiota and the development of NEC. METHODS: Meconium and feces were collected from premature newborn infants (between 24 and 32 weeks gestation) over the first 4 weeks of life. Fecal S100A12 concentrations were assayed by immunoassay, and samples were subject to 16S rDNA analysis using next-generation sequencing techniques. RESULTS: Fecal samples were collected from four infants that developed NEC and 18 control infants. Prior to developing NEC, fecal S100A12 concentrations were not elevated; however, following NEC diagnosis, concentrations were highly elevated. The fecal bacterial communities of infants with NEC did not differ significantly from control infants. However, potentially pathogenic bacteria were detected in significantly more infants with NEC than in controls (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: At birth, fecal S100A12 concentrations were not elevated in premature infants subsequently developing NEC in this cohort. Following NEC diagnosis, S100A12 concentrations were highly elevated, suggesting that this potentially could act as a marker of disease progression. Higher detection rates of potentially pathogenic bacteria in NEC infants suggest that a range of potentially pathogenic bacteria may collectively contribute to NEC pathogenesis.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although protection against infectious diseases has been observed among breastfed infants as compared to formula-fed infants, possible benefits of breastfeeding by allergic mothers for allergy prevention remain controversial. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine whether maternal allergy would influence immune markers (secretory immunoglobulin A [sIgA], interleukin-8 [IL-8], soluble CD14 [sCD14]) in colostrum and the associations between maternal allergy and fecal sIgA levels in breastfed infants. METHODS: Study subjects were enrolled from the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese Children (PATCH) birth cohort study. Colostrum samples were obtained from 98 lactating mothers. Stool samples were collected from 108 infants within 5 days after birth and at 2 and 4 months of age. We compared concentrations of sIgA, IL-8, and sCD14 in colostrum between mothers with and without a history of allergic disease and allergic sensitization. We also compared fecal sIgA levels between breastfed and formula-fed infants and between infants with allergic and nonallergic mothers. RESULTS: The sIgA concentrations were significantly higher in colostrum from allergic mothers than from nonallergic mothers (P = .01) and from allergic mothers who were immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitized compared to nonallergic mothers who were not IgE sensitized (P = .023). Breastfed infants had significantly higher fecal sIgA levels as compared to formula-fed infants, regardless of whether their lactating mothers had an allergy (P < .05). CONCLUSION: We found that breastfeeding is associated with increased infants' fecal sIgA levels and may have potential protective effects to the infants during the first 4 months of life, regardless of whether their lactating mothers have allergies.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the mode of delivery and type-of-feeding impact on gut microbiota. We demonstrated higher fecal bifidobacteria in infants who were breast-fed (BF) or fed formula with prebiotics polydextrose (PDX) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) versus formula without prebiotics. Here, we tested feces of that cohort for lactobacilli and Staphylococcus aureus, 2 types of bacteria present in breast milk. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized study, 21- to 30-day-old term infants vaginally delivered and exclusively formula-fed received a cow's milk-based formula (control, n = 80) or the same formula with 4 g/L (1:1 ratio) of PDX/GOS (PDX/GOS, n = 77). A reference BF group (n = 71) was included. Stool samples were obtained at baseline and after 30 and 60 days of feeding to assess fecal bacteria by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Pairwise comparisons between baseline-adjusted means log10 colony-forming unit per gram feces of total lactobacilli counts (8.37 in control, 8.46 in PDX/GOS, and 8.42 in BF) showed a significant difference only between PDX/GOS and control at 30 and 60 days combined (P = 0.035), utilizing generalized estimating equations method. Baseline-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of colonization with S aureus was lower in control (OR 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.22-1.00, P = 0.049) and PDX/GOS (OR 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.94, P = 0.03) groups versus the BF group. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria found in breast milk, such as lactobacilli and S aureus can also be found in infant feces. S aureus, traditionally considered harmful, may aid in educating the coevolving immune system. Modifying formula by adding prebiotics may bring gut microbiota closer to that of BF infants in terms of beneficial microbes.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to examine the changes in bacteria in hospitalized preterm infants during the first month of life. METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected daily from 12 preterm infants. DNA was extracted from swabs from day of birth and weekly thereafter. Bacterial taxa were identified with next generation sequencing using universal bacterial primers targeted at the 16S ribosomal DNA on a 454 Roche titanium platform. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units, and taxonomy was assigned against the Greengenes databank using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology version 1.4. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. Functional assessment of the microbiome was performed with Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). RESULTS: Average birth weight and gestational age were 1055 g and 28 weeks, respectively. There were 6 to 35 different bacterial families identified in the day-of-birth samples, unrelated to the mode of delivery. Richness decreased through hospitalization (week 1, 16.9 +/- 7.7 vs weeks 3-5, 10.7 +/- 3.4, P < 0.001). The Shannon diversity index demonstrated the lowest diversity at birth, an increase at week 2, followed by a rapid decline at weeks 3 to 5, suggesting the development of a more uniform microbiota composition after 2 weeks of stay at a neonatal intensive care unit. Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Enterococcaceae constituted the majority of the bacterial families. Bifidobacterium spp were infrequently detected at extremely low levels. PICRUSt analysis revealed the enhancement of peroxisome, PPAR, and adipocytokine signaling; plant-pathogen interaction; and aminobenzoate degradation pathways in week 1 samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although preterm infants have individualized microbiota that are detectable at birth, the differences decrease during the neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization with increasing prominence of pathogenic microbiota.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Each year in Canada there are 5 million episodes of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) with up to 70% attributed to an unidentified pathogen. Moreover, 90% of individuals with AGE do not seek care when ill, thus, burden of disease estimates are limited by under-diagnosing and under-reporting. Further, little is known about the pathogens causing AGE as the majority of episodes are attributed to an \"unidentified\" etiology. Our team has two main objectives: 1) to improve health through enhanced enteric pathogen identification; 2) to develop economic models incorporating pathogen burden and societal preferences to inform enteric vaccine decision making. METHODS/DESIGN: This project involves multiple stages: 1) Molecular microbiology experts will participate in a modified Delphi process designed to define criteria to aid in interpreting positive molecular enteric pathogen test results. 2) Clinical data and specimens will be collected from children aged 0-18 years, with vomiting and/or diarrhea who seek medical care in emergency departments, primary care clinics and from those who contact a provincial medical advice line but who do not seek care. Samples to be collected will include stool, rectal swabs (N = 2), and an oral swab. Specimens will be tested employing 1) stool culture; 2) in-house multiplex (N = 5) viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel; and 3) multi-target (N = 15) PCR commercially available array. All participants will have follow-up data collected 14 days later to enable calculation of a Modified Vesikari Scale score and a Burden of Disease Index. Specimens will also be collected from asymptomatic children during their well child vaccination visits to a provincial public health clinic. Following the completion of the initial phases, discrete choice experiments will be conducted to enable a better understanding of societal preferences for diagnostic testing and vaccine policy. All of the results obtained will be integrated into economic models. DISCUSSION: This study is collecting novel samples (e.g., oral swabs) from previously untested groups of children (e.g., those not seeking medical care) which are then undergoing extensive molecular testing to shed a new perspective on the epidemiology of AGE. The knowledge gained will provide the broadest understanding of the epidemiology of vomiting and diarrhea of children to date.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent studies have suggested that the gut microflora has metabolic effects. We aimed to evaluate postnatal growth in preterm infants who received different probiotic supplements, and to assess the safety of probiotic administration. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was performed at three tertiary care neonatal units. Preterm infants were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation over 4-6 weeks with placebo (group C) or probiotics (group P). Group P comprised three subgroups: P1 received Bifidobacterium lactis, P2 received Bifidobacterium longum, and P3 received B. lactis and B. longum. We assessed postnatal growth during the supplementation period and up to a corrected gestational age (GA) of 41 weeks when body composition was assessed using whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were performed on suspicion of late-onset sepsis. RESULTS: The study comprised 199 preterm infants with a mean GA of 29.1 +/- 1.4 weeks and a mean birth weight of 1173 +/- 210 g, who received a placebo (group C, n = 52) or probiotics (group P, n = 147) from the first week of life. At the end of the supplementation period, no statistically significant differences were seen between the groups in relation to the mean body weight (group C = 1906 +/- 23 g, group P = 1875 +/- 14 g, p = 0.25), length, or head circumference. The incidence rates of necrotizing enterocolitis and late-onset sepsis were similar in the two groups. At the corrected GA of 41 weeks, there were no differences between the groups with respect to anthropometric measurements or body composition analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants receiving Bifidobacterium supplements did not exhibit better postnatal growth compared with those who received placebo treatment. No adverse effects were associated with probiotic administration. Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT01379417.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Considerable effort has been made to categorise the bacterial composition of the human gut and correlate findings with gastrointestinal disease. The infant gut has long been considered sterile at birth followed by rapid colonisation; however, this view has recently been challenged. We examined first-pass meconium from healthy term infants to confirm or refute sterility. METHODS: Healthy mothers were approached following vaginal delivery. First-pass meconium stools within 24 hours of delivery were obtained from healthy, breastfed infants with tight inclusion/exclusion criteria including rejecting any known antibiotic exposure - mother within 7 days preceding delivery or infant after birth. Stools were processed in triplicate for fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) with 16S rRNA-targeted probes including Bifidobacterium; Bacteroides-Prevotella; Lactobacillaceae/Enterococcaceae; Enterobacteriaceae; Streptococcaceae; Staphylococcaceae and Enterococcaceae. Absolute counts of all bacteria and proportional identification of each bacterial group were calculated. Confirmation of bacterial presence by PCR was undertaken on FISH-positive samples. RESULTS: The mothers of 31 newborn infants were recruited, 15 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and provided a sample within 24 hours of birth, processed in the lab within 4 hours. All babies were 37-40 weeks gestation. 8/15 were male, mean birth weight was 3.4 kg and mean maternal age was 32 years. Meconium samples from 10/15 (66%) infants had evidence of bacteria based on FISH analysis. Of these, PCR was positive in only 1. Positive FISH counts ranged from 2.2-41.8 x 10(4) cells/g with a mean of 15.4 x 10(4) cells/g. (The limit of detection for automated counting is 10(6) cells/g). Cell counts were too low to allow formal diversity analysis. Amplification by PCR was not possible despite positive spiked samples demonstrating the feasibility of reaction. One baby was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae. The others contained 2-5 genera, with Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae and Bacteroides-Prevotella the most prevalent. There was no association between bacterial counts and rupture of membrane duration, time to passage of meconium or time to lab. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that low numbers of bacteria are present in first-pass meconium samples from healthy, vaginally-delivered, breastfed term infants. Only two-thirds of meconium samples had detectable bacteria, though at levels too low for automated counting or for reliable confirmation by PCR. This study suggests that gut bacterial colonisation is extremely limited at birth and occurs rapidly thereafter.",

			"abstract": "Universal rotavirus vaccination with RotaTeq was introduced in Israel in December 2010. We examined hospitalization rates of children under 5 years of age due to all-cause and rotavirus gastroenteritis, both before and 3 years after universal introduction of the vaccination. An ongoing hospital-based surveillance network that was established in November 2007, accessed information regarding hospitalization of children due to gastroenteritis (n = 6205) in 3 hospitals in northern Israel, with an annual average of about 60,000 children under 5 years of age living in the catchment area of these hospitals. Stool samples were tested for rotavirus by immunochromatography. Compared to the period preceding implementation of the universal rotavirus vaccination (2008-2010), hospitalizations due to rotavirus gastroenteritis in children <5 years of age decreased significantly, by 55% (95% CI 43%-67%) during the period of universal vaccination (2011-2013), a decrease that was sustained throughout the 3 year period. This reduction was greater in children aged 0-23 months (60-61%) than in toddlers aged 24-59 months (36%). A 32% (95% CI 21%-45%) decrease in the incidence of all-cause gastroenteritis was also observed. During the period preceding universal vaccination, rotavirus diarrhea showed typical winter seasonality, with highest incidence in December. However, the winter peak was substantially blunted during the period of universal immunization. Surveillance of rotavirus gastroenteritis should continue to assess the long-term impact of such a program. Our findings are of relevance to high and middle-income countries considering the introduction of a universal rotavirus immunization program.",

			"abstract": "Gut colonisation with bifidobacteria in early infancy is essential for the well-being of the infant. Gestational age and mode of delivery are among the factors influencing the colonisation process. The aim was to characterise the bifidobacterial composition in the gut of one-month-old full-term and pre-term Brazilian infants, both being delivered vaginally or by caesarean section. Fourty nine Brazilian (Vicosa, Minas Gerais state) one-month-old infants were divided in two groups: full-term (n = 24) and pre-term (n = 25), and compared to each other. Each group was then characterised according to its mode of delivery. Infant stool samples were available for bifidobacterial characterisation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. All study infants were colonised by bifidobacteria. Bifidobacterium longum colonised all full-term and pre-term newborns. Differences were observed in counts of Bifidobacterium genus and Bifidobacterium longum between full-term and pre-term infants (8.8 log cells/g, IQR 7.9-9.1 vs. 7.1 log cells/g, IQR 6.6-8.6, p = 0.02 and 8.3 log cells/g, IQR 6.7-9.1 vs. 6.4 log cells/g, IQR 6.1-6.7, p = 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the prevalence of Bifidobacterium lactis differed between pre-term caesarean and pre-term vaginally born infants (50.0% vs. 93.8%, p = 0.023). Gut bifidobacterial composition of one-month-old full-term infants differs from that of pre-term newborns in Vicosa, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Gestational age is a factor influencing bacterial numbers and species, while mode of delivery have an impact on the prevalence and quantity of bifidobacteria in studied infants. Bifidobacteria may have an impact on later health of the infants and the species B. longum and B. lactis might provide clues on the potential probiotic applications in pre-term newborns at the risk of developing postnatal complications.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies of the causes of diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries have looked at severe disease in people presenting for care, and there are few estimates of pathogen-specific diarrhoea burdens in the community. METHODS: We undertook a birth cohort study with not only intensive community surveillance for diarrhoea but also routine collection of non-diarrhoeal stools from eight sites in South America, Africa, and Asia. We enrolled children within 17 days of birth, and diarrhoeal episodes (defined as maternal report of three or more loose stools in 24 h, or one loose stool with visible blood) were identified through twice-weekly home visits by fieldworkers over a follow-up period of 24 months. Non-diarrhoeal stool specimens were also collected for surveillance for months 1-12, 15, 18, 21, and 24. Stools were analysed for a broad range of enteropathogens using culture, enzyme immunoassay, and PCR. We used the adjusted attributable fraction (AF) to estimate pathogen-specific burdens of diarrhoea. FINDINGS: Between November 26, 2009, and February 25, 2014, we tested 7318 diarrhoeal and 24 310 non-diarrhoeal stools collected from 2145 children aged 0-24 months. Pathogen detection was common in non-diarrhoeal stools but was higher with diarrhoea. Norovirus GII (AF 5.2%, 95% CI 3.0-7.1), rotavirus (4.8%, 4.5-5.0), Campylobacter spp (3.5%, 0.4-6.3), astrovirus (2.7%, 2.2-3.1), and Cryptosporidium spp (2.0%, 1.3-2.6) exhibited the highest attributable burdens of diarrhoea in the first year of life. The major pathogens associated with diarrhoea in the second year of life were Campylobacter spp (7.9%, 3.1-12.1), norovirus GII (5.4%, 2.1-7.8), rotavirus (4.9%, 4.4-5.2), astrovirus (4.2%, 3.5-4.7), and Shigella spp (4.0%, 3.6-4.3). Rotavirus had the highest AF for sites without rotavirus vaccination and the fifth highest AF for sites with the vaccination. There was substantial variation in pathogens according to geography, diarrhoea severity, and season. Bloody diarrhoea was primarily associated with Campylobacter spp and Shigella spp, fever and vomiting with rotavirus, and vomiting with norovirus GII. INTERPRETATION: There was substantial heterogeneity in pathogen-specific burdens of diarrhoea, with important determinants including age, geography, season, rotavirus vaccine usage, and symptoms. These findings suggest that although single-pathogen strategies have an important role in the reduction of the burden of severe diarrhoeal disease, the effect of such interventions on total diarrhoeal incidence at the community level might be limited.",

			"article_name": "Salivirus in Children and Its Association with Childhood Acute Gastroenteritis: A Paired Case-Control Study.",
			"abstract": "Salivirus was recently discovered in children with gastroenteritis and in sewage. Though a causative role for salivirus in childhood gastroenteritis was suggested in the previous study, the relationship between salivirus and acute gastroenteritis has not yet been clearly clarified. The sewage strain reported by Ng, although represented by incomplete genome sequencing data, was distinct from previously reported saliviruses, and had not previously been detected in humans. A case-control study examining 461 paired stool samples from children with diarrhea and healthy controls (1:1) was conducted in this study. Also, common diarrheal viruses were detected and complete genome of a salivirus was determined. Results showed that salivirus was detected in 16 (3.5%) and 13 (2.8%) of the case and control samples, respectively; no differences in detection rates (p=0.571) or mean values of viral loads (p=0.400) were observed between the groups. Multivariate Cox regression revealed no association between salivirus and gastroenteritis (p=0.774). The data also demonstrated that salivirus infection did not exacerbate clinical symptoms of gastroenteritis in children. Furthermore, complete genome sequence of a salivirus recovered from the feces of a child with diarrhea (i.e., SaliV-FHB) shared a 99% nucleotide identity with the sewage strain. In conclusion, a paired case-control study did not support a causative role for salivirus strains detected in this study with pediatric gastroenteritis. This study also demonstrated that all known saliviruses can be detected in the feces of children with or without gastroenteritis.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that fecal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analysis by electronic nose (eNose) allows for early detection of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). STUDY DESIGN: In 3 neonatal intensive care units, fecal samples of infants born at gestational age </= 30 weeks were collected daily, up to the 28th day of life. Included infants were allocated in 3 subgroups: NEC, sepsis, and matched controls. Three time windows were defined: (1) T-5,-4 (5 and 4 days before diagnosis); (2) T-3,-2 (3 and 2 days before diagnosis); and (3) T-1,0 (day before and day of diagnosis). Three subgroups were analyzed by eNose. RESULTS: Fecal VOC profiles of infants with NEC (n = 13) could significantly be discriminated from matched controls (n = 14) at T-3,-2 (area under the curve +/- 95% CI, P value, sensitivity, specificity: 0.77 +/- 0.21, P = .02, 83%, 75%); the accuracy increased at T-1,0 (0.99 +/- 0.04, P </= .001, 89%, 89%). VOC profiles of infants with NEC were also significantly different from those with sepsis (n = 31) at T-3,-2 (0.80 +/- 0.17, P = .004, 83%, 75%), but not at T-1,0 (0.64 +/- 0.18, P = .216, 89%, 57%). CONCLUSIONS: In this proof of principle study, we observed that fecal VOC profiles of infants with NEC could be discriminated from controls, from 2-3 days predating onset of clinical symptoms. Our observations suggest that VOC-profiling by eNose has potential as a noninvasive tool for the early prediction of NEC.",

No data on the prevalence and genetic variability of norovirus are available for Pakistan, where early childhood mortality due to acute gastroenteritis is common. We tested 255 fecal specimens from children under 5 years of age hospitalized between April 2006 and March 2008 with severe acute gastroenteritis in five hospitals in the four largest cities in Pakistan for norovirus by real-time RT-PCR. Positive samples were further genotyped by conventional RT-PCR targeting the 5'-end of the capsid gene followed by sequencing of the positive PCR products. Overall, 41 (16.1%) samples tested positive for norovirus with an equal frequency in rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative samples. Nine (22%) samples were genogroup (G)I positive, 30 (73%) GII positive and two (5%) samples contained a mixture of GI and GII viruses.

			"abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognised all Cronobacter species as human pathogens. Among premature neonates and immunocompromised infants, these infections can be life-threatening, with clinical presentations of septicaemia, meningitis and necrotising enterocolitis. The neurological sequelae can be permanent and the mortality rate as high as 40-80%. Despite the highlighted issues of neonatal infections, the majority of Cronobacter infections are in the elderly population suffering from serious underlying disease or malignancy and include wound and urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, bacteraemia and septicaemia. However, no age profiling studies have speciated or genotyped the Cronobacter isolates. A clinical collection of 51 Cronobacter strains from two hospitals were speciated and genotyped using 7-loci multilocus sequence typing (MLST), rpoB gene sequence analysis, O-antigen typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The isolates were predominated by C. sakazakii sequence type 4 (63%, 32/51) and C. malonaticus sequence type 7 (33%, 17/51). These had been isolated from throat and sputum samples of all age groups, as well as recal and faecal swabs. There was no apparent relatedness between the age of the patient and the Cronobacter species isolated. Despite the high clonality of Cronobacter, PFGE profiles differentiated strains across the sequence types into 15 pulsotypes. There was almost complete agreement between O-antigen typing and rpoB gene sequence analysis and MLST profiling. This study shows the value of applying MLST to bacterial population studies with strains from two patient cohorts, combined with PFGE for further discrimination of strains.",

We sought to identify clinical characteristics and microbial signatures in the gastrointestinal microbiota preceding diagnosis of LO-BSI in premature infants. METHOD: Daily faecal samples and clinical data were collected over two years from 369 premature neonates (<32 weeks gestation). We analysed samples from 22 neonates who developed LO-BSI and 44 matched control infants. Next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene regions amplified by PCR from total faecal DNA was used to characterise the microbiota of faecal samples preceding diagnosis from infants with LO-BSI and controls. Culture of selected samples was undertaken, and bacterial isolates identified using MALDI-TOF. Antibiograms from bloodstream and faecal isolates were compared to explore strain similarity. RESULTS: From the week prior to diagnosis, infants with LO-BSI had higher proportions of faecal aerobes/facultative anaerobes compared to controls. Risk factors for LO-BSI were identified by multivariate analysis. Enterobacteriaceal sepsis was associated with antecedent multiple lines, low birth weight and a faecal microbiota with prominent Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcal sepsis was associated with Staphylococcus OTU faecal over-abundance, and the number of days prior to diagnosis of mechanical ventilation and of the presence of centrally-placed lines. In 12 cases, the antibiogram of the bloodstream isolate matched that of a component of the faecal microbiota in the sample collected closest to diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The gastrointestinal tract is an important reservoir for LO-BSI organisms, pathogens translocating across the epithelial barrier. LO-BSI is associated with an aberrant microbiota, with abundant staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae and a failure to mature towards predominance of obligate anaerobes.",

SETTING: Community setting in rural India. PARTICIPANTS: LBW infants aged 3-7 days. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were randomised to receive probiotic (VSL#3, 10 billion colony-forming units (cfu)) or placebo for 30 days, and were followed up for 2 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) as per the Integrated Management of Neonatal Childhood Illnesses algorithm, as diagnosed by fieldworkers/physicians. RESULTS: 668 infants were randomised to VSL#3 and 672 to placebo. By intention-to-treat analysis, the risk of PSBI among infants in the overall population of LBW infants was not statistically significant (RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.03)). Probiotics reduced median days of hospitalisation (6 days vs 3 days in probiotics) (p=0.018) but not the risk of hospitalisation (RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.04). The onset of PSBI in 10% of infants occurred on the 40th day in the probiotics arm versus the 25th day in the control arm (p=0.063). CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation of LBW infants with probiotics VSL#3 (10 billion cfu) for 30 days led to a non-significant 21% reduction in risk of neonatal sepsis. A larger study with sufficient power and a more specific primary end point is warranted to confirm the preventive effect of VSL#3 on neonatal sepsis in LBW infants.

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the main causative agents of community-acquired acute diarrhoea in children using conventional methods and PCR. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 100 children under 5 years of age with acute diarrhoea during the autumn-winter period of 2010-2011. Rotaviruses and adenoviruses were detected by the stool antigen immunoassay, and Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, Shigella spp, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Clostridium difficile, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), and diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli were detected by culture methods and PCR. RESULTS: Overall, enteropathogens were identified in 73% of the children. Bacteria, viruses, and mixed infections were noted in 37%, 24%, and 12% of diarrhoeal cases, respectively. The most common enteric pathogens were rotaviruses (31%), followed by C. difficile (17%), Campylobacter jejuni (13%), Salmonella spp (11%), and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (aEPEC) strains (10%). Compared with culture methods, PCR increased the overall detection frequency of the bacterial enteropathogens by 4%. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni suggests that the number of campylobacteriosis cases in Poland may be underestimated; this pathogen should be investigated routinely in children with diarrhoea. Moreover, C. difficile might be considered a causative or contributing agent of diarrhoea in 14.8% of children aged >1 year.",

			"abstract": "AIM: Changes in gut microbiota may contribute to NEC, but most studies focus on bacteria. Case reports suggest a link between cytomegalovirus (CMV) or other enteric viruses and NEC, but there are few case series systematically looking at common potential viral causes. We aimed to assess the presence of candidate viruses in blood or stool of a case series of infants with NEC managed in one surgical centre. METHODS: We identified 22 infants diagnosed with NEC (from November 2011 to March 2014): 17 had suitable blood stored, of whom 14 also had suitable stool samples stored. Blood was analysed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenovirus, and stool by PCR for norovirus, sappovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus and rotavirus. RESULTS: All samples were negative. CONCLUSION: Although case reports indicate an episodic association of enteric viruses in NEC, the inability to detect any of these viruses in our 17 NEC infants suggests that a viral aetiology is unlikely to be causative for most sporadic forms of NEC.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Late onset sepsis (LOS) contributes to mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that microbes causing LOS originate from the gut, and that distortions in the gut microbial community increases subsequent risk of LOS. STUDY DESIGN: We examined the gut microbial community in prospectively collected stool samples from preterm infants with LOS and an equal number of age-matched controls at two sites (Cincinnati, OH and Birmingham, AL), by sequencing the bacterial 16S rDNA. We confirmed our findings in a subset of infants by whole genome shotgun sequencing, and analyzed the data using R and LEfSe. RESULTS: Infants with LOS in Cincinnati, as compared to controls, had less abundant Actinobacteria in the first samples after birth (median 18 days before sepsis onset), and less abundant Pseudomonadales in the last samples collected prior to LOS (median 8 days before sepsis onset). Infants with LOS in Birmingham, as compared to controls, had no differences identified in the first sample microbial communities, but Lactobacillales was less abundant in the last samples prior to LOS (median 4 days before sepsis onset). Sequencing identified detectable levels of the sepsis-causative organism in stool samples prior to disease onset for 82% of LOS cases. CONCLUSIONS: Translocation of gut microbes may account for the majority of LOS cases. Distortions in the fecal microbiota occur prior to LOS, but the form of distortion depends on timing and site. The microbial composition of fecal samples does not predict LOS onset in a generalizable fashion.",

			"abstract": "Preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are exposed to multidrug-resistant bacteria previously adapted to the hospital environment. The aim of the present study was to characterize the bacterial antibiotic-resistant high-risk lineages colonizing preterm infants during their NICU stay and their persistence in faeces after 2 years. A total of 26 preterm neonates were recruited between October 2009 and June 2010 and provided 144 faecal samples. Milk samples (86 mother's milk, 35 human donor milk and 15 formula milk) were collected at the same time as faecal samples. An additional faecal sample was recovered in 16 infants at the age of 2 years. Samples were plated onto different selective media, and one colony per morphology was selected. Isolates were identified by 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence and MALDI-TOF. Antibiotic susceptibility (agar dilution), genetic diversity (RAPD, PFGE and MLST) and virulence factors (only in enterococcal and staphylococcal isolates) were determined by PCR. A high proportion of antibiotic-resistant high-risk clones was detected in both faecal and milk samples during the NICU admittance. Almost all infants were colonized by Enterococcus faecalis ST64 and Enterococcus faecium ST18 clones, while a wider genetic diversity was observed for the Gram-negative isolates. Multidrug-resistant high-risk clones were not recovered from the faecal samples of the 2-year-olds. In conclusion, the gut of preterm infants admitted to the NICU might be initially colonized by antibiotic-resistant and virulent high-risk lineages, which are later replaced by antibiotic-susceptible community ones.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common and serious gastrointestinal disorder among preterm neonates. We aimed to assess a specific gut microbiota profile associated with NEC. METHODS: Stool samples and clinical data were collected from 4 geographically independent neonatal intensive care units, over a 48-month period. Thirty stool samples from preterm neonates with NEC (n = 15) and controls (n = 15) were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and culture-based methods. The results led us to develop a specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for Clostridium butyricum, and we tested stool samples from preterm neonates with NEC (n = 93) and controls (n = 270). We sequenced the whole genome of 16 C. butyricum strains, analyzed their phylogenetic relatedness, tested their culture supernatants for cytotoxic activity, and searched for secreted toxins. RESULTS: Clostridium butyricum was specifically associated with NEC using molecular and culture-based methods (15/15 vs 2/15; P < .0001) or qPCR (odds ratio, 45.4 [95% confidence interval, 26.2-78.6]; P < .0001). Culture supernatants of C. butyricum strains from preterm neonates with NEC (n = 14) exhibited significant cytotoxic activity (P = .008), and we identified in all a homologue of the beta-hemolysin toxin gene shared by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, the etiologic agent of swine dysentery. The corresponding protein was secreted by a NEC-associated C. butyricum strain. CONCLUSIONS: NEC was associated with C. butyricum strains and dysbiosis with an oxidized, acid, and poorly diversified gut microbiota. Our findings highlight the plausible toxigenic mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of NEC.",

			"abstract": "Microbial colonization of the human gastrointestinal tract plays an important role in establishing health and homeostasis. However, the time-dependent functional signatures of microbial and human proteins during early colonization of the gut have yet to be determined. To this end, we employed shotgun proteomics to simultaneously monitor microbial and human proteins in fecal samples from a preterm infant during the first month of life. Microbial community complexity increased over time, with compositional changes that were consistent with previous metagenomic and rRNA gene data. More specifically, the function of the microbial community initially involved biomass growth, protein production, and lipid metabolism, and then switched to more complex metabolic functions, such as carbohydrate metabolism, once the community stabilized and matured. Human proteins detected included those responsible for epithelial barrier function and antimicrobial activity. Some neutrophil-derived proteins increased in abundance early in the study period, suggesting activation of the innate immune system. Likewise, abundances of cytoskeletal and mucin proteins increased later in the time course, suggestive of subsequent adjustment to the increased microbial load. This study provides the first snapshot of coordinated human and microbial protein expression in a preterm infant's gut during early development.",

However, SaV infection has not been reported in the Philippines. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and genetic diversity of SaV in hospitalized children aged less than 5 years with acute gastroenteritis. STUDY DESIGN: Stool samples were collected from children with acute gastroenteritis at three hospitals in the Philippines from June 2012 to August 2013. SaV was detected by reverse transcription real-time PCR, and the polymerase and capsid gene sequences were analyzed. Full genome sequencing and recombination analysis were performed on possible recombinant viruses. RESULTS: SaV was detected in 7.0% of the tested stool samples (29/417). In 10 SaV-positive cases, other viruses were also detected, including rotavirus (n=6), norovirus (n=2), and human astrovirus (n=2). Four known SaV genotypes (GI.1 [7], GI.2 [2], GII.1 [12], and GV [2]) and one novel recombinant (n=3) were identified by polymerase and capsid gene sequence analysis. Full genome sequencing revealed that the 5' nontranslated region (NTR) and nonstructural protein region of the novel recombinant were closely related to the GII.1 Bristol/98/UK variant, whereas the structural protein region and 3' NTR were closely related to the GII.4 Kumamoto6/Mar2003/JPN variant. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: SaV was regularly detected in hospitalized children due to acute gastroenteritis during the study period. A novel recombinant, SaV GII.1/GII.4, was identified in three cases at two different study sites.",

Specific and non-specific metabolites of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides have been widely investigated in urine, where some of the suitable biomarkers present rates of detection higher than 80%, which stand for an ongoing chronic exposure to traces of these chemicals. Hair is a promising emerging matrix, but some issues on its suitability and the biological relevance needs further research.

The study was conducted using 110 stool samples from the same number of children under five years old who were inpatients at three paediatric hospitals in Havana, Cuba, between October and December 2011. The samples were tested for rotavirus and other enteric pathogens using traditional and molecular microbiological methods. Pathogens were detected in 85 (77.3 %) of the children. Rotavirus was the most commonly found, appearing in 54.5 % of the children, followed by bacteria (29 %) and parasites (10.9 %). Other viral pathogens detected included adenovirus (6.4 %) and astrovirus (3.6 %). In rotavirus-positives cases, at least one other pathogen was detected, usually a bacterium (26.6 %). More than three episodes of watery diarrhea in 24 hours were observed in 78.3 % of the cases. Dehydration was found in 30 (50 %) rotavirus-positive children, of whom seven (11.6 %) were transferred to an intensive care unit due to complications of metabolic acidosis. Rotavirus was most commonly observed among children under 12 months old (65 %). The highest incidence of infection occurred in children who were under the care of a relative at home (78.3 %), had not been breastfed (65 %), or had been breastfed for less than six months (28.3 %). The genotype combinations most frequently found were G9P8 (28.3 %) and G1P8 (10 %).

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether antiretroviral (ARV) medications can be detected in meconium from second or third trimester, labor and delivery (L&D), or postnatal exposures. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty ARV medications were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 598 meconium samples from uninfected infants born to pregnant women with HIV enrolled in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study. RESULTS: ARV detection in meconium following third trimester exposure was 85.7%-94.4% for all ARVs except stavudine (0%, n = 2), likely because of low doses and a high limit for quantification. Of 107 samples with some second trimester only ARV exposures, meconium was positive for only lopinavir, tenofovir, or efavirenz in 11.8%-14.3% of exposed neonates; administration of these ARVs occurred between gestational weeks 25-28 in the positive samples. Days without lopinavir or tenofovir before delivery significantly correlated with decreasing concentrations of lopinavir and tenofovir in meconium. Tenofovir and lamivudine concentrations significantly correlated with increasing gestational age among infants with continuous second and third trimester exposure. Zidovudine given during L&D or for neonatal prophylaxis was detected in 95.1% and 94.6% of meconium samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in ARV treatments during pregnancy offered a unique opportunity to investigate ARV detection in meconium. ARVs in meconium primarily reflect third trimester ARV exposures, although 6 of 107 second trimester only exposures were detected. Zidovudine administration during L&D was detected in meconium indicating potential urine contamination or rapid incorporation into meconium. These data will improve interpretation of meconium drug test results.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Premature infants are often given glycerin enemas or suppositories to facilitate meconium evacuation and transition to enteral feeding. The purpose of this study was to assess the available evidence for this treatment strategy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, Central, and trial registries for randomized controlled trials of premature infants treated with glycerin enemas or suppositories. Data were extracted in duplicate and meta-analyzed using a random effects model. RESULTS: We identified 185 premature infants treated prophylactically with glycerin enemas in one trial (n = 81) and suppositories in two other trials (n = 104). All infants were less than 32 weeks gestation and had no congenital malformations. Treatment was associated with earlier initiation of stooling in one trial (2 vs 4 days, P = .02) and a trend towards earlier meconium evacuation in another (6.5 vs 9 days, P = .11). Meta-analysis demonstrated no effect on transition to enteral feeding (0.7 days faster, P = .43) or mortality (P = 0.50). There were no reports of rectal bleeding or perforation but there was a trend towards increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis with glycerin enemas or suppositories (risk ratio = 2.72, P = .13). These three trials are underpowered and affected by one or more major methodological issues. As a result, the quality of evidence is low to very low. Three other trials are underway. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the use glycerin enemas or suppositories in premature infants in inconclusive. Meta-analyzed data suggest that treatment may be associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. Careful monitoring of ongoing trials is required.",

			"abstract": "The accumulation of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium of term newborns has been described as one potential biomarker of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. FAEEs accumulate in multiple alcohol-exposed fetal tissues and in the placenta. Limited research has focused on the identification of the premature newborn exposed to alcohol in utero. We hypothesized that maternal alcohol use occurs in a significant proportion of premature deliveries and that this exposure can be detected as elevated placental FAEEs. The goals of this study were to 1) determine the prevalence of maternal alcohol use in the premature newborn and 2) investigate whether placental FAEEs could identify those newborns with fetal alcohol exposure. This prospective observational study evaluated 80 placentas from 80 women after premature delivery. Subjects were interviewed for alcohol intake and placental FAEEs were quantified via GC/MS. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curves were generated to evaluate the ability of placental FAEEs to predict maternal drinking during pregnancy. Adjusted ROC curves were generated to adjust for gestational age, maternal smoking, and illicit drug use. 30% of the subjects admitted to drinking alcohol during pregnancy and approximately 14% answered questions indicative of problem drinking (designated AUDIT+). The specific FAEEs ethyl stearate and linoleate, as well as combinations of oleate + linoleate + linolenate (OLL) and of OLL + stearate, were significantly (p<0.05) elevated in placentas from AUDIT+ pregnancies. Adjusted ROC Curves generated areas under the curve ranging from 88-93% with negative predictive values of 97% for AUDIT+ pregnancies. We conclude that nearly one third of premature pregnancies were alcohol-exposed, and that elevated placental FAEEs hold great promise to accurately determine maternal alcohol use, particularly heavy use, in pregnancies complicated by premature delivery.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infectious diarrhea leads to significant mortality in children, with 40 % of these deaths occurring in Africa. Classic human astroviruses are a well-established etiology of diarrhea. In recent years, seven novel astroviruses have been discovered (MLB1, MLB2, MLB3, VA1/HMO-C, VA2/HMO-B, VA3/HMO-A, VA4); however, there have been few studies on their prevalence or potential association with diarrhea. METHODS: To investigate the prevalence and diversity of these classic and recently described astroviruses in a pediatric population, a case-control study was performed. Nine hundred and forty nine stools were previously collected from cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea and matched controls of patients less than 5 years of age in Kenya and The Gambia. RT-PCR screening was performed using pan-astrovirus primers. RESULTS: Astroviruses were present in 9.9 % of all stool samples. MLB3 was the most common astrovirus with a prevalence of 2.6 %. Two subtypes of MLB3 were detected that varied based on location in Africa. In this case-control study, Astrovirus MLB1 was associated with diarrhea in Kenya, whereas Astrovirus MLB3 was associated with the control state in The Gambia. Classic human astrovirus was not associated with diarrhea in this study. Unexpectedly, astroviruses with high similarity to Canine Astrovirus and Avian Nephritis Virus 1 and 2 were also found in one case of diarrhea and two control stools respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Astroviruses including novel MLB- and VA-clade members are commonly found in pediatric stools in Kenya and The Gambia. The most recently discovered astrovirus, MLB3, was the most prevalent and was found more commonly in control stools in The Gambia, while astrovirus MLB1 was associated with diarrhea in Kenya. Furthermore, a distinct subtype of MLB3 was noted, as well as 3 unanticipated avian or canine astroviruses in the human stool samples. As a result of a broadly reactive PCR screen for astroviruses, new insight was gained regarding the epidemiology of astroviruses in Africa, where a large proportion of diarrheal morbidity and mortality occur.",

In contrast to vaginally delivered infants, the gut microbiota of infants delivered by C-section showed significantly less resemblance to their mothers. Nutrition had a major impact on early microbiota composition and function, with cessation of breast-feeding, rather than introduction of solid food, being required for maturation into an adult-like microbiota.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 80 healthy twins and their mothers to determine the frequency of excretion of ciprofloxacin-resistant, potentially pathogenic E. coli. Stool specimens were cultured selectively for ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Isolates were categorized on the basis of additional resistance and virulence profiles. We also prospectively collected clinical metadata. RESULTS: Fifteen children (19%) and 8 mothers (20%) excreted ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli at least once. Overall, 33% of 40 families had at least 1 member whose stool specimen yielded ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli on culture. Fifty-seven submitted stool specimens (2.8%) contained such organisms; clones ST131-H30 and ST405 accounted for 52 and 5 of the positive specimens, respectively. Length of hospital stay after birth (P = .002) and maternal colonization (P = .0001) were associated with subsequent childhood carriage of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli; antibiotic use, acid suppression, sex, mode of delivery, and maternal perinatal antibiotic use were not.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) treatment among HIV-infected pregnant women results in fetal tenofovir (TFV) exposure. Fetal TFV toxicity was demonstrated in animals, but most clinical investigations have not observed toxicity in humans. METHODS: We evaluated HIV-exposed, uninfected infants in the Surveillance Monitoring for Antiretroviral Therapy Toxicities cohort of the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study whose mothers were prescribed TDF for >/= 8 third trimester weeks. Infant dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were obtained at 0-4 weeks to measure whole body bone mineral content. Meconium TFV concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Fifty-eight TFV-exposed infants had meconium TFV quantified. Detectable concentrations were 11-48,100 ng/g; 3 infants had undetectable concentrations. Maternal TDF prescription duration ranged from 8 to 41 gestational weeks; infant gestational ages were 36-41 weeks. Meconium TFV concentrations were not correlated with TFV exposure duration or timing and did not vary by concomitant prescription of protease inhibitors. Increased meconium TFV concentrations were associated with greater gestational ages (rho = 0.29, P = 0.03) and lower maternal plasma HIV RNA before delivery (rho = -0.29, P = 0.04). Meconium TFV concentrations were not associated with infant weight, length (n = 58) or bone mineral content (n = 49). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we explored associations between meconium TFV concentrations and infant growth and bone measurements; we did not observe a meconium concentration-dependent relationship for these infant outcomes. These findings support other clinical research failing to show dose-response relationships for growth and bone outcomes among intrauterine TFV-exposed infants. High meconium TFV concentrations correlated with low maternal viral load, suggesting maternal TDF adherence significantly contributes to meconium TFV concentrations.",

			"abstract": "Although viruses are well-established causes of acute gastroenteritis, few data on the circulation of these pathogens in Porto Velho, state of Rondonia, Brazil, are available. Thus, faecal samples from hospitalised diarrhoeic children, under six years of age, were collected and tested for the presence of norovirus (NoV), adenovirus (AdV) and astrovirus (AstV) from February 2010-February 2012. Specimens were screened by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and viruses were found in 10.7% (63/591) of the cases. NoV, AdV and AstV were detected in 7.8%, 2% and 0.8% of the samples, respectively. NoV infection was observed at all ages and was most prevalent in zero-18-month-old children (84.7%; p = 0.002). A higher incidence of NoV was detected from February-April 2010, when it was found in 52.2% of the cases. Co-infections involving these viruses, rotavirus and enteropathogenic bacteria were detected in 44.4% (28/63) of the children with viral diarrhoea. Nosocomial infections were demonstrated in 28.6% (18/63) of the cases in which viruses were detected. The present paper reports, for the first time, the circulation of NoV and AstV among the paediatric population of Porto Velho and it contributes to our understanding of the roles of these pathogens in gastrointestinal infections.",

			"abstract": "Alcohol is the most popular legal drug used in our society today, and its consumption by pregnant women remains an important public health problem. Gestational alcohol consumption can result in a continuum of adverse fetal outcomes known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Effective strategies are needed to prevent the increasing adoption of risky drinking behaviors. Because ethanol itself is only measurable for a few hours after ethanol intake in conventional matrices including blood, urine, and sweat, these matrices are only useful to detect recent ethanol exposure. Since approximately early 2000, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites have received increasing attention because of their specificity and, in some cases, wide time window of detection in non-conventional matrices including hair and meconium. In the attempt to update analytical methods for the determination of non-oxidative markers of alcohol, the objective of this study is to review published studies that measure fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEE), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), and phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in alternative biological matrices, focusing on the extraction and detection methods and full analytical conditions used.",

A randomized, double-blind, 28 day parallel feeding trial compared gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance and hydration in healthy term newborn infants fed either a commercialized soy formula (with history of safe use) containing sucrose as 20% of total carbohydrate, no supplemental short-chain FOS (scFOS) and no mixed carotenoids (lutein, lycopene, beta-carotene) as a control (CF, n = 62 infants) or one of two experimental soy-based formulas, EF1 (n = 64) and EF2 (n = 62) containing scFOS (2.5 g/L) and mixed carotenoids. EF1 differed from EF2 by containing sucrose. Results indicated no significant study group differences (p > 0.05) in study completion rates (CF = 81, EF1 = 86, &amp; EF2 = 87%), growth, mean rank stool consistency, stool frequency, formula intake, spit-up/vomit, and safety measures (urine specific gravity, USG; hydration status and adverse events).

We determined the composition of bile acids in samples that were collected from the gallbladder and intestine. METHODS: The bile-acid profiles of intestinal contents and the gallbladder were obtained from nine fetuses who died from abortion or respiratory failure within 72 h after birth. Intestinal content samples were collected from seven intestinal locations. The bile-acid profiles of meconium were also obtained from seven full-term live births for comparison. The profiles were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The bile acids in meconium collected from stillborn and live births were mainly chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, conjugated with taurine, glycine, and sulfate. The same bile acids were found in the gallbladder, except that sulfate was not found. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfate-conjugated bile acid is found in urine, but rarely in stool. In this study, the gallbladder bile acid contained no sulfate conjugates, but these were present in intestinal contents and meconium. These results indicate that sulfate-conjugated bile acids are not excreted into the intestine through the biliary tract but originate from swallowed amniotic fluid that contains fetal urine.",

This study investigated the epidemiological situation of viruses that cause diarrhea in Japanese pediatric patients. This study enrolled a total of 2,381 fecal specimens collected between 2009 and 2013 from Japanese children with acute gastroenteritis. There is currently a 70.4% prevalence of viruses causing diarrhea among these Japanese pediatric outpatients. Norovirus was detected in 39.3% of the patients, whereas the prevalence of rotavirus, human parechovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, and Aichi virus was 20.1, 6.6, 6.1, 5.6, 4.8, 2.3, and 0.1%, respectively. Co-infections were observed at the prevalence rates of 13.4 and 0.5% for double infections and triple infections, respectively. Mixed viral infections were found commonly in Japanese outpatients, and the norovirus seemed to play a major role in co-infections. Viral diarrhea cases were detected mostly in children younger than 3 years of age. The norovirus and rotavirus can be detected throughout the year, with a peak during the cold and dry seasons, whereas other common viruses are found during no specific season. Surveillance data revealed that a wide variety of viruses has caused diarrhea to circulate currently in Japanese pediatric outpatients, with very high detection rates; and norovirus and rotavirus are the most important pathogens. The data obtained from this study are valuable for compiling the overall picture of several viruses that causes diarrhea and associates with acute gastroenteritis in the Japanese pediatric population.",

METHODS: This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in premature infants with a birth weight <1500 g and a gestational age <32 weeks who received a visceral osteopathic treatment 3 times during their first week of life or no treatment. RESULTS: Passage of the last meconium occurred after a median of 7.5 days (95% confidence interval: 6-9 days, n = 21) in the intervention group and after 6 days (95% confidence interval: 5-9 days, n = 20,) in the control group (p = 0.11). However, osteopathic treatment was associated with a 8 day longer time to full enteral feedings (p = 0.02), and a 34 day longer hospital stay (Median = 66 vs. 100 days i.e.; p=0.14). Osteopathic treatment was tolerated well and no adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Visceral osteopathic treatment of the abdomen did not accelerate meconium excretion in VLBW (very low birth weight)-infants. However infants in the osteopathic group had a longer time to full enteral feedings and a longer hospital stay, which could represent adverse effects. Based on our trial results, we cannot recommend visceral osteopathic techniques in VLBW-infants. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials.gov: NCT02140710.",

			"abstract": "Monozygotic and dizygotic twin studies investigating the relative roles of host genetics and environmental factors in shaping gut microbiota composition have produced conflicting results. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiota composition of a healthy dichorionic triplet set. The dichorionic triplet set contained a pair of monozygotic twins and a fraternal sibling, with similar pre- and post-natal environmental conditions including feeding regime. V4 16S rRNA and rpoB amplicon pyrosequencing was employed to investigate microbiota composition, and the species and strain diversity of the culturable bifidobacterial population was also examined. At month 1, the monozygotic pair shared a similar microbiota distinct to the fraternal sibling. By month 12 however, the profile was more uniform between the three infants. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the microbiota composition revealed strong clustering of the monozygotic pair at month 1 and a separation of the fraternal infant. At months 2 and 3 the phylogenetic distance between the monozygotic pair and the fraternal sibling has greatly reduced and by month 12 the monozygotic pair no longer clustered separately from the fraternal infant. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of the bifidobacterial population revealed a lack of strain diversity, with identical strains identified in all three infants at month 1 and 12. The microbiota of two antibiotic-treated dichorionic triplet sets was also investigated. Not surprisingly, in both triplet sets early life antibiotic administration appeared to be a major determinant of microbiota composition at month 1, irrespective of zygosity. By month 12, early antibiotic administration appeared to no longer exert such a strong influence on gut microbiota composition. We hypothesize that initially host genetics play a significant role in the composition of an individual's gut microbiota, unless an antibiotic intervention is given, but by month 12 environmental factors are the major determinant.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Israel has used an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)-only schedule since 2005 (95% coverage). Silent reintroduction of wild type poliovirus 1 (WPV1) into Israel in early 2013 was detected in Southern Israel via routine environmental surveillance without clinical cases. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the rate of WPV1 excretion by age and residence and inform decision-making regarding supplemental immunization with OPV. STUDY DESIGN: A convenience sample of Bedouin and Jewish residential areas in the epicenter of the incident, focusing on under 8 year-olds who not previously given OPV. Fecal samples were directly tested for WPV1 RNA using a novel qRT-PCR assay. Positive samples were confirmed by gold standard cell culture and subject to genotyping. RESULTS: Overall, 2196 non-duplicate fecal samples were collected and analyzed. WPV1 was detected in 61 samples (2.8%), 55 of which (90.2%) were from Bedouins. WPV1 excretion rates were 5.4% among Bedouins and 0.6% among Jewish individuals. Respective age-specific rates among Bedouin and Jewish children were 4.9% and 0.2% for 0-2 years and 7.2% and 1.7% for 2-8 years. Molecular testing had 89.5% sensitivity (higher than culture) and 100% specificity. CONCLUSION: The rapid performance of a field study to evaluate WPV1 excretion unequivocally demonstrated substantial WPV1 infection rates among children under 8 years in Southern Israel, thus informing the decision to vaccinate this age group with bOPV and risk communication to both healthcare personnel and the public. Rapid development and implementation of molecular screening can thus underpin risk assessment and management in complex epidemiological situations.",

Tests were performed with three different types of columns: reversed phase, ion exchange and HILIC. As a unique method could not be determined for the simultaneous analysis of all compounds, three columns were selected and suitable chromatographic methods were optimized. Similar results were noticed for the separation of the target compounds dissolved in either meconium extract or solvent for reversed phase and ion exchange columns. However, for HILIC, the matrix had a significant influence on the peak shape and robustness of the method. Finally, the analytical methods were applied to \"real\" meconium samples.",

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of children with gastrointestinal hemangiomas culled from our Vascular Anomalies Center database. We detailed the location of visceral and cutaneous tumors, as well as radiologic and procedural methods used for diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: A total of 9 of the 16 children (14 girls and 2 boys) with hollow visceral hemangiomas also had cutaneous lesions. The most common extravisceral sites were regional facial lesions (n = 6), multifocal lesions (n = 2), and a solitary chest lesion (n = 1). Presenting symptoms were melena and hematochezia in the first 4 months of life (n = 14); several infants required multiple blood transfusions. The most frequent locations were small bowel and mesentery. One-half of the patients (n = 8) were diagnosed by laparotomy; the majority (n = 12) had suspicious radiologic findings. Corticosteroid and/or propranolol were the most common therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Melena and hematochezia, sometimes with profound anemia, in the first 4 months of life, suggest the possibility of intestinal infantile hemangioma even in the absence of cutaneous tumor. Intestinal bleeding, particularly in association with a regional facial lesion, should initiate workup: ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging display diagnostic features.

Transmission of intestinal parasites is more frequent in tropical and sub-tropical areas where sanitation is poor and socioeconomic conditions are deficient. Panama is a country where climate and social conditions could be reflected in a high number of people infected with intestinal parasites. The presence, prevalence, and distribution of intestinal parasites in this country have been approached to date only in very restricted areas and population groups, but the impact of intestinal parasite infections at the national level is unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between 2008 and 2010 to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites across Panama. Overall, 14 municipalities in seven provinces of Panama were surveyed. The presence of eggs, cysts, and larvae was assessed by microscopy in 1123 human fecal samples using a concentration technique. A questionnaire to identify risk factors associated with the frequency of intestinal parasites in the study population was also prepared and performed. Overall, 47.4% of human samples presented parasites. Variables including community type, age group, occupation, co-presence of commensals and socioeconomic factors (use of shoes and type of sanitation) were significantly associated with intestinal parasites (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The preliminary data obtained in the current study, showing a high prevalence of fecal-oral transmitted parasites in Panama, place intestinal parasitism as a major health problem in this country.

To gain insight into the epidemiology of the infection in a certain geographic area, molecular methods are needed to determine the species/genotypes and subtypes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From 2004 to 2009, 161 cryptosporidiosis cases were detected in two hospitals in Barcelona. Diagnosis was performed by microscopic observation of oocysts in stool specimens following modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Most cases (82%) occurred in children. The number of cases increased in summer and autumn. Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium was performed in 69 specimens, and C. hominis and C. parvum were identified in 88.4% and 10.1% of the cases, respectively. C. meleagridis was detected in one specimen. Subtyping based on the gp60 polymorphism showed six subtypes, four C. hominis and two C. parvum. Subtype IbA10G2 was the most prevalent subtype corresponding to 90% of all C. hominis isolates. This is the first report on the distribution of specific Cryptosporidium subtypes from humans in Spain. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In our geographic area, the anthroponotic behavior of C. hominis, the lower infective dose, and the higher virulence of certain subtypes may contribute to the high incidence of human cryptosporidiosis caused by the IbA10G2 subtype.

The current study examined this issue by using material from alleged food poisoning incidents in the state of Victoria, Australia, for the period 2008-2012. Norovirus was identified, by either ORF (open reading frame) 1 or ORF 2 RT-PCR methodology, in 159 of 379 (42.0%) sporadic gastroenteritis incidents, thereby showing that norovirus was an important cause of sporadic gastroenteritis. The number of sporadic norovirus incidents did not vary significantly from year to year, indicating that the pool of circulating norovirus remained constant. Norovirus ORF 1 genotypes identified included GI.1, GI.2, GI.3, GI.4, GI.b, GI.d, GII.2, GII.4 (including variants 2006a, 2006b, 2007, and 2009), GII.16, GII.22, GII.b, GII.e, and GII.g.

METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial, women received probiotic milk or placebo from 36 weeks of gestation up to 3 months postnatally while breast-feeding. The probiotic milk contained Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L acidophilus La-5, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12. Stool samples were collected from the mothers at 30 to 36 weeks of gestation and 3 months after birth, and from the child at age 10 days, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years, and bacteria were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, stool samples from 3-month-old and 2-year-old children were characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA gene deep sequencing to estimate the bacterial classes and genera, and the alpha- and beta-diversity. RESULTS: Three months after birth, both the prevalence and the relative abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria were significantly increased among the mothers in the probiotic group compared with among those in the placebo group. Only the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG bacteria colonized the children at 10 days and at 3 months of age. There were no significant differences in the abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria between the groups at 1 and 2 years of age. For the bacterial classes and genera, and alpha- and beta-diversity, there were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Different probiotic bacteria seem to have different ability to transfer from the mother to the child. We found no evidence that the probiotics altered the microbial composition or alpha- and beta-diversity of the children.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic characteristics and compare the roles of these five viruses in outpatient children with diarrhea in Shanghai. A total of 436 fecal samples were collected from pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis from January 2010 to December 2011. The selected samples were subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or PCR to detect and genotype RV, NoV, SaV, HAstV and HAdV. RV (43.3 %, 189/436) was the most prevalent virus, followed by NoV (28.9 %, 126/436), HAdV (7.1 %, 31/436). HAstV (1.8 %, 8/436) and SaV (0.5 %, 2/436). The percentage of multiple infection cases was 14.9 % (65/436), and RV + NoV was the predominant mixed infection. The RV genotype combinations of P[8]G3 (52/189, 27.5 %), P[8]G1 (51/189, 26.9 %) and P[8]G9 (48/189, 25.4 %) occurred most frequently. The predominant NoV genotype was GII.4 (73.0 %, 92/126), and the majority of GII.4 clustered as GII.4-2006b (65.2 %, 60/92). Two of the SaV cases were identified as GI.2 and GII.1. All HAstV-positive samples belonged to HAstV-1. The predominant HAdV type was HAdV-41 (45.2 %, 14/31). This study clearly shows the diversity of the viral causative agents of acute gastroenteritis in outpatient children in Shanghai, which will provide baseline information for future vaccination strategies and development in this area.",

Preparations of cell-free culture supernatants were processed and tested, and revealed that cell-free culture supernatants of isolates L. paracasei MSMC39-1, L. casei MSMC39-3, and W. confusa MSMC57-1 decreased the production of TNF-alpha significantly and were heat resistant. Only L. paracasei MSMC39-1 supernatant was proteinase-K sensitive. The effects of viable bacteria, heat-killed bacteria, and sonicated bacteria were compared. The heat-killed preparations of isolate W. confusa MSMC57-1 decreased the production of TNF-alpha. Sonicated cell preparations did not significantly alter TNF-alpha production.

The incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis and the prevalence of circulating rotavirus strains has been monitored in three sentinel hospitals since June 2006. The average percentage of rotavirus positive cases among all children under 5 years old hospitalized for gastroenteritis during the pre-vaccine period (2006-2010) was 44%. This percentage dropped to 29%, 15% and 24% in the 3 years post vaccine introduction (2011, 2012 and 2013), which is a decline of 34%, 66%, and 45%, respectively. Declines in prevalence were greatest among children 0-1 years of age (53%) and were most prominent during the winter and autumn rotavirus season. The prevalence of the G2P[4] and G9P[8] genotype sharply increased in the post vaccine period (2011-2013) compared to the previous seasons (2006-2010). Rotavirus vaccines have reduced greatly the number of children hospitalized due to rotavirus infection at the three sentinel hospitals; it is however unclear if the predominance of G2P[4] and G9P[8] genotypes is related to the vaccine introduction, or if this is attributable to normal genotype fluctuations. Continued surveillance will be pivotal to answer this question in the future.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for children, although sparse data is available on the etiology of diarrhea in China. This study was conducted to determine main causes that underlie childhood diarrhea and related diseases. METHOD: Surveillance data for diarrhea was collected from 213 participating hospitals between 2009 and 2013. These stool specimens, from children aged 0-59 months, were then analyzed for a panel of etiological agents consisting of 5 viruses, 8 bacteria and 3 protozoa. The proportion of children who tested positive for each pathogen was calculated and seasonal patterns for major organisms were determined. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 44.6% of the 32,189 samples from children with diarrhea. The most commonly detected pathogens were rotavirus (29.7% of cases), norovirus (11.8%), Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC; 5.0%), adenovirus (4.8%), non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS; 4.3%), and Shigella spp. (3.6%). A strong seasonal pattern was observed for these organisms, including rotavirus (winter), norovirus (autumn), and DEC, NTS, and Shigella (summer). CONCLUSION: A wide range of enteropathogens were detected in this five-year surveillance study; rotavirus and norovirus were most common among children under the age five. These findings should serve as robust evidence for public health entities when planning and developing national intervention programs in China.",

In this study, the in vitro growth of purified HMOs and other related carbohydrates was evaluated using individual strains of Enterobacteriaceae and an Enterobacteriaceae consortia enriched from piglet feces. None of the Enterobacteriaceae strains grew on 2'-fucosyllactose, 6'-sialyllactose, or lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT); however, several strains were capable of utilizing galactooligosaccharides, maltodextrin, and the mono- and disaccharide components of HMOs for growth. The enriched fecal consortia also did not grow on 2'-fucosyllactose or 6'-sialyllactose, but there was limited growth on LNnT. It was concluded that 2'-fucosyllactose and 6'-sialyllactose supplementation of preterm infant formula should not lead to an increase in Enterobacteriaceae; however, supplementation with LNnT may require further study.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Noroviruses bind to gut histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), but only 70%-80% of individuals have a functional copy of the FUT2 (\"secretor\") gene required for gut HBGA expression; these individuals are known as \"secretors.\" Susceptibility to some noroviruses depends on FUT2 secretor status, but the population impact of this association is not established. METHODS: From December 2011 to November 2012, active AGE surveillance was performed at 6 geographically diverse pediatric sites in the United States. Case patients aged <5 years were recruited from emergency departments and inpatient units; age-matched healthy controls were recruited at well-child visits. Salivary DNA was collected to determine secretor status and genetic ancestry. Stool was tested for norovirus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Norovirus genotype was then determined by sequencing. RESULTS: Norovirus was detected in 302 of 1465 (21%) AGE cases and 52 of 826 (6%) healthy controls. Norovirus AGE cases were 2.8-fold more likely than norovirus-negative controls to be secretors (P < .001) in a logistic regression model adjusted for ancestry, age, site, and health insurance. Secretors comprised all 155 cases and 21 asymptomatic infections with the most prevalent norovirus, GII.4. Control children of Meso-American ancestry were more likely than children of European or African ancestry to be secretors (96% vs 74%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: FUT2 status is associated with norovirus infection and varies by ancestry. GII.4 norovirus exclusively infected secretors. These findings are important to norovirus vaccine trials and design of agents that may block norovirus-HBGA binding.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate FC concentrations in healthy children between 1 and 18 months of age. METHODS: Healthy children aged 1-18 months were enrolled in this study at the Department of Children's Health Care in Shanghai, China. Children's stool samples were collected and analyzed, and FC concentration was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The children's weights and lengths were measured. Parents were asked to complete a brief questionnaire regarding several clinical and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: The FC concentrations were unevenly distributed; the median FC concentration was 174.3 mug/g (range: 6.0-1097.7 mug/g) or 2.241 log10 mug/g (range: 0.775-3.041 log10 mug/g) for all 288 children. The children were divided into several age groups: 1-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months and 12-18 months. The median FC concentrations for these age groups were 375.2 mug/g (2.574 log10 mug/g), 217.9 mug/g (2.338 log10 mug/g), 127.7 mug/g (2.106 log10 mug/g), 96.1 mug/g (1.983 log10 mug/g) and 104.2 mug/g (2.016 log10 mug/g), respectively. A significant correlation between age and FC concentration was found (r=-0.490, p<0.001). A simple correlation analysis of weight-for-length Z-scores or weight-for-age Z-scores vs. FC concentrations showed that these variables were negatively correlated (Spearman's rho=-0.287, p<0.001; Spearman's rho=-0.243, p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The FC levels of children aged 1-18 months exhibit a downward trend with increasing age and are greater than the normal levels observed in healthy adults. In healthy children aged <6 months, FC levels are high. In children aged 6-18 months, FC concentrations are relatively low but are still higher than those of children aged >4 years.",

			"abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory disease of the newborn bowel, primarily affecting premature infants. Early intestinal colonization has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC. The objective of this prospective case-control study was to evaluate differences in the intestinal microbiota between infants who developed NEC and unaffected controls prior to disease onset. We conducted longitudinal analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of 312 samples obtained from 12 NEC cases and 26 age-matched controls with a median frequency of 7 samples per subject and median sampling interval of 3 days. We found that the microbiome undergoes dynamic development during the first two months of life with day of life being the major factor contributing to the colonization process. Depending on when the infant was diagnosed with NEC (i.e. early vs. late onset), the pattern of microbial progression was different for cases and controls. The difference in the microbiota was most overt in early onset NEC cases and controls. In proximity to NEC onset, the abundances of Clostridium sensu stricto from Clostridia class were significantly higher in early onset NEC subjects comparing to controls. In late onset NEC, Escherichia/Shigella among Gammaproteobacteria, showed an increasing pattern prior to disease onset, and was significantly higher in cases than controls six days before NEC onset. Cronobacter from Gammaproteobacteria was also significantly higher in late onset NEC cases than controls 1-3 days prior to NEC onset. Thus, the specific infectious agent associated with NEC may vary by the age of infant at disease onset. We found that intravenously administered antibiotics may have an impact on the microbial diversity present in fecal material. Longitudinal analysis at multiple time points was an important strategy utilized in this study, allowing us to appreciate the dynamics of the premature infant intestinal microbiome while approaching NEC at various points.",

GDM attracts increasing attention due to its potential harm to the heath of both the fetus and the mother. We designed this case-control study to investigate the metabolome response of newborn meconium and urine to maternal GDM. GDM mothers (n = 142) and healthy controls (n = 197) were recruited during June-July 2012 in Xiamen, China. The newborns' metabolic profiles were acquired using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The data showed that meconium and urine metabolome patterns clearly discriminated GDM cases from controls. Fourteen meconium metabolic biomarkers and three urinary metabolic biomarkers were tentatively identified for GDM. Altered levels of various endogenous biomarkers revealed that GDM may induce disruptions in lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and purine metabolism. An unbalanced lipid pattern is suspected to be a GDM-specific feature. Furthermore, the relationships between the potential biomarkers and GDM risk were evaluated by binary logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. A combined model of nine meconium biomarkers showed a great potential in diagnosing GDM-induced disorders.",

This dispute has lasted for centuries, but since the 1960s, detrimental effects of meconium itself on the lungs have been demonstrated in animal experiments. In clinical MAS, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn is the leading cause of death in MAS. Regarding the complex chemical composition of meconium, it is difficult to identify a single agent responsible for the pathophysiology. However, considering that meconium is stored in the intestines, partly unexposed to the immune system, aspirated meconium could be recognized as 'danger', representing damaged self. The common denominator in the pathophysiology could therefore be activation of innate immunity. Thus, a bulk of evidence implies that meconium is a potent activator of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, complement, prostaglandins and reactive oxygen species. We hypothesize that the two main recognition systems of innate immunity, the Toll-like receptors and the complement system, recognize meconium as 'danger', which leads not only to lung dysfunction but also to a systemic inflammatory response. This might have therapeutic implications in the future.",

This pilot study evaluated therapeutic potential of N-acetylcysteine in modulation of meconium-induced inflammation and oxidative lung injury. Oxygen-ventilated adult rabbits were intratracheally given 4 ml/kg of meconium (25 mg/ml) or saline (Sal, n = 6). Thirty minutes later, meconium-instilled animals were treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine (10 mg/kg, Mec + NAC, n=6) or were non-treated (Mec, n = 6). All animals were oxygen-ventilated for additional 5 hours. Total and differential blood leukocyte counts were determined at baseline, and at 1, 3 and 5 h of the treatment. After sacrificing animals, left lung was saline-lavaged and total and differential cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were determined. Right lung was used for biochemical analyses and for estimation of wet-dry weight ratio. In lung tissue homogenate, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), dityrosine, lysine-lipid peroxidation (LPO) products, and total antioxidant status (TAS) were detected. In isolated lung mitochondria, TBARS, dityrosine, lysine-LPO products, thiol group content, conjugated dienes, and activity of cytochrome c oxidase were estimated. To evaluate systemic effects of meconium instillation and NAC treatment, TBARS and TAS were determined also in plasma. To evaluate participation of eosinophils in the meconium-induced inflammation, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) was detected in plasma and lung homogenate. Meconium instillation increased oxidation markers and ECP in the lung and decreased TAS (all P<0.05). NAC treatment reduced ECP and oxidation markers (all P<0.05, except of dityrosine in homogenate and conjugated dienes in mitochondria) and prevented a decrease in TAS (P<0.01) in lung homogenate compared to Mec group.

One hundred and ninety seven positive faecal samples were obtained from patients between 2006 and 2008. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify the VP7 and VP4 gene segments of these samples, and G and P typing was carried out subsequently. The most common strain type was G1P[8], and the emergent global G9-type was identified in both years. RVA strain type G2P[4], previously reported in Ireland in 1999, was also detected.

Molecular analysis of the VP7 genes revealed G1 strains circulating within lineage Ic as previously reported in Ireland. In addition, new sublineage within lineage I of G1 strains was also identified. Analysis of G4 strain NRVL-Hum-49 revealed similarity with other human G4 viruses in lineage Ib. G9 strain NRVL-Hum-74 clustered with a unique G9 strain, CIT-254, in lineage IIIc. This data supports the observations made that the profile of RVA strains in Ireland appears to be dynamic. This study demonstrates that the circulation of human rotavirus is changing continuously in Ireland, and continued surveillance of the circulating strains is needed to detect the appearance of new strains, or new variants which may lead to vaccine breakthrough.",

Transmitted via the faecal-oral route, infection with the parasite can occur through ingestion of water, food or other fomites contaminated with its infective oocyst stage. In the months of November and December 2012, there were 18 notified cases of cryptosporidiosis from Broome, Western Australia. The 5-year average for the Kimberley region for this period is <1 case. Interviews conducted by Broome local government staff on the notified cases revealed that 11/18 cases had been swimming at the Broome public swimming pool. Molecular analyses of extracted DNA performed on 8/18 microscopy-positive faecal samples from interviewed cases and three water samples from different locations at the hypervariable glycoprotein 60 (gp60) gene, identified the C. hominis IbA10G2 subtype in all human samples and one water sample.",

However, because little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in the healthy asymptomatic population, the clinical value of these additional findings is unclear. A case-control study was carried out in a population of patients served by general practitioners in the Netherlands. A total of 2710 fecal samples from case and matched control subjects were subjected to multiplex real-time PCR for the 11 most common bacterial and four protozoal causes of GE. Of 1515 case samples, 818 (54%) were positive for one or more target organisms. A total of 49% of the controls were positive. Higher positivity rates in cases compared to controls were observed for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Clostridium difficile, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli/Shigella spp., enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and Giardia lamblia. However, Dientamoeba fragilis and Shiga-like toxigenic E. coli were detected significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while no difference in prevalence was found for typical EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. The association between the presence of microorganisms and GE was the weakest in children aged 0 to 5 years. Higher relative loads in cases further support causality. This was seen for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic E. coli, and C. parvum/hominis, and for certain age categories of those infected with C. difficile, enteroaggregative E. coli, and atypical EPEC. For D. fragilis and Shiga-like toxigenic E. coli/enterohemorrhagic E. coli, pathogen loads were lower in cases. Application of molecular diagnostics in GE is rapid, sensitive and specific, but results should be interpreted with care, using clinical and additional background information.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Escherichia coli are frequently isolated from diarrheic children in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, Nigeria, but their virulent properties are not routinely evaluated. Therefore, the etiology of childhood diarrheal disease attributable to diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) in Abuja, Nigeria remains unknown. METHODOLOGY: Stool specimens from 400 acute diarrheic children between 0 and 60 months of age were studied. E. coli strains isolated were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for nine virulence genes and HEp-2 cell adherence to detect and identify five distinct diarrheagenic E. coli categories. RESULTS: Diarrheagenic E.coli was detected in 51 (12.8%) of the diarrheic children. The observed DEC pathotypes were enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) in 18 (4.5%) children, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) in 16 (4.0%), enteroaggrative E. coli (EAEC) in 8 (2.0%), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) in 6 (1.5%), and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) in 3 (0.8%). Four (1.0 %) EPEC strains with only the eae+ gene that adhered diffusely to HEp-2 cell were identified as atypical EPEC. All the DEC categories except atypical EPEC were identified in children between 6 and 12 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the need for routine evaluation of diarrheic children for virulence properties of infectious DEC. Atypical EPEC are emerging among the DEC pathotypes isolated from childhood acute gastroenteritis in Abuja, Nigeria.",

To monitor the molecular epidemiology of NoVs genogroup II (GII) in Novosibirsk, Russia, a total of 10,198 stool samples from young children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis and two asymptomatic comparison groups were collected from 2003 to 2012. All samples were screened for the presence of NoV GII, rotavirus, and astrovirus by RT-PCR. The prevalence of NoV in gastroenteritis cases was 13.1%, varying from 7.1% to 21.3% in different seasons. Rotavirus and/or astrovirus were detectable in 25% of the NoV-positive samples. NoV was detected throughout the year with a seasonal increase during winter months. Based on sequence analysis of regions D and/or C within the VP1 gene, 892 identified NoV strains were divided into nine genotypes-GII.3 (51%), GII.4 (44%), GII.6 (2%), as well as GII.1, GII.2, GII.5, GII.7, GII.16, and GII.21 (totally, 3%).

Based on phylogenetic analysis of the ORF1/ORF2 junction region sequences, GII.P21/GII.3 recombinant and GII.P4/GII.4 were prevalent genotypes (totally, 93%) and their ratio changed every season. The median age of children with NoV infection was 6.6 months (range, <1-35 months), but it was different depending on NoV genotype. Children infected with the NoV GII.3 were younger (median 6.2 months) than GII.4-positive patients (median 9.1 months).

These microbes can also be detected in mother's milk, suggesting a potential role of human milk in the colonisation of infant's gut. However, little is known about the timing of bacteria appearance in human milk, and whether human milk is the first source of inoculation. Here, we investigated whether specific strains are shared sustainably between maternal milk and infant's gut. Faecal samples and human milk were collected from 102 healthy mother-infant pairs (infant's faeces: meconium, 7, 30 days of age; mother's milk: once before delivery, colostrum, 7, 30 days after delivery). Bifidobacterial strains were isolated from these samples, and were discriminated by means of multilocus sequencing typing. No bifidobacteria were detected from human milk collected before delivery, or colostrum. Strains were isolated only from human milk samples obtained 7 days after birth or later. On the other hand, bifidobacterial strains were obtained from infant's faeces throughout the study period, sometimes as early as the first day of life (meconium). We have found that bifidobacterial species belonging to Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum could be identified as monophyletic between infant's faeces and their mother's milk. These strains were confirmed to be sustainably shared between maternal milk and infant's gut. Moreover, monophyletic strains were isolated at the same time point or earlier from infant's faeces than from human milk, and none were isolated earlier from human milk than from infant's faeces. Although it remains unclear whether human milk is the first source of microbes for infants, our results confirm that human milk is a reservoir of bifidobacteria, and specific strains are shared between infant's intestine and human milk during breastfeeding.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a stool color card used for a mass screening of biliary atresia conducted over 19 years. In addition, the age at Kasai procedure and the long-term probabilities of native liver survival were investigated. STUDY DESIGN: From 1994 to 2011, the stool color card was distributed to all pregnant women in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. Before or during the postnatal 1-month health checkup, the mothers returned the completed stool color card to the attending pediatrician or obstetrician. All suspected cases of biliary atresia were referred for further examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by laparotomy or operative cholangiography for high-risk cases before the Kasai procedure. Patients with biliary atresia were followed from the date of their Kasai procedure until liver transplantation, death, or October 31, 2013, whichever comes sooner. RESULTS: A total of 313,230 live born infants were screened; 34 patients with biliary atresia were diagnosed. The sensitivity and specificity of stool color card screening at the 1-month check-up was 76.5% (95% CI 62.2-90.7) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.9-100.0), respectively. Mean age at the time of Kasai procedure was 59.7 days. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the native liver survival probability at 5, 10, and 15 years was 87.6%, 76.9%, and 48.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of the stool color card have been demonstrated by our 19-year cohort study.

Risk of MAS, complications of MAS and endotracheal suction, mortality, duration of neonatal intensive care unit stay, and neurodevelopmental outcome at 9 months were assessed. RESULTS: Maternal age, consistency of meconium, mode of delivery, birth weight, sex, and Apgar scores were similar in the groups. In total, 39 (32%) neonates developed MAS and 18 (14.8%) of them died. There were no significant differences in MAS, its severity and complications, mortality, and neurodevelopmental outcome for the 2 groups. One infant had a complication of endotracheal suctioning, which was mild and transient.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is the main cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in children in Africa. Monovalent human rotavirus vaccine (RV1) was added into Malawi's infant immunisation schedule on Oct 29, 2012. We aimed to assess the impact and effectiveness of RV1 on rotavirus gastroenteritis in the 2 years after introduction. METHODS: From Jan 1, 2012, to June 30, 2014, we recruited children younger than 5 years who were admitted into Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, with acute gastroenteritis. We assessed stool samples from these children for presence of rotavirus with use of ELISA and we genotyped rotaviruses with use of RT-PCR. We compared rotavirus detection rates in stool samples and incidence of hospital admittance for rotavirus in children from Jan 1 to June 30, in the year before vaccination (2012) with the same months in the 2 years after vaccination was introduced (2013 and 2014). In the case-control portion of our study, we recruited eligible rotavirus-positive children from the surveillance platform and calculated vaccine effectiveness (one minus the odds ratio of vaccination) by comparing infants with rotavirus gastroenteritis with infants who tested negative for rotavirus, and with community age-matched and neighbourhood-matched controls. FINDINGS: We enrolled 1431 children, from whom we obtained 1417 stool samples (99%). We detected rotavirus in 79 of 157 infants (50%) before the vaccine, compared with 57 of 219 (40%) and 52 of 170 (31%) in successive calendar years after vaccine introduction (p=0.0002). In the first half of 2012, incidence of rotavirus hospital admission was 269 per 100,000 infants compared with 284 in the same months of 2013 (rise of 5.8%, 95% CI -23.1 to 45.4; p=0.73) and 153 in these months in 2014 (a reduction from the prevaccine period of 43.2%, 18.0-60.7; p=0.003). We recruited 118 vaccine-eligible rotavirus cases (median age 8.9 months; IQR 6.6-11.1), 317 rotavirus-test-negative controls (9.4 months; 6.9-11.9), and 380 community controls (8.8 months; 6.5-11.1). Vaccine effectiveness for two doses of RV1 in rotavirus-negative individuals was 64% (95% CI 24-83) and community controls was 63% (23-83). The point estimate of effectiveness was higher against genotype G1 than against G2 and G12. INTERPRETATION: Routine use of RV1 reduced hospital admissions for several genotypes of rotavirus in children younger than 5 years, especially in infants younger than 1 year. Our data support introduction of rotavirus vaccination at the WHO recommended schedule, with continuing surveillance in high-mortality countries.

However, the mechanisms underlying these relations remain elusive. The goal of the present study was to prospectively investigate the development of the intestinal microbiota as a potential pathway linking maternal prenatal stress and infant health. The development of the infant intestinal microbiota was followed over the first 110 days after birth in a healthy cohort of 56 vaginally born Dutch infants. Additionally, the relation between infant intestinal microbiota and gastrointestinal and allergic symptoms was examined. Results showed that maternal prenatal stress, i.e., either reported stress or elevated basal maternal salivary cortisol concentrations or both, was strongly and persistently associated with the infants' microbiota composition as determined by a phylogenetic microarray. Infants of mothers with high cumulative stress (i.e., high reported stress and high cortisol concentrations) during pregnancy had significantly higher relative abundances of Proteobacterial groups known to contain pathogens (related to Escherichia, Serratia, and Enterobacter), and lower relative abundances of lactic acid bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus, Lactoccus, Aerococcus) and Bifidobacteria, altogether characteristics of a potentially increased level of inflammation. Furthermore, this aberrant colonization pattern was related to more maternally reported infant gastrointestinal symptoms and allergic reactions. In conclusion, clear links were found between maternal prenatal stress and the infant intestinal microbiota and health. Although causality cannot be concluded, the results suggest a possible mechanism by which maternal prenatal stress influences the offspring development. These results suggest a potential for bacterial interventions to enhance offspring health and development in pregnant women with stress.",

Unfortunately, necrotizing enterocolitis can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases and clinical conditions especially during the early course of the disease. This diagnostic uncertainty is particularly relevant to clinical evaluation and medical management and potentially leads to unnecessary and extended periods of cessation of enteral feedings and prolonged courses of parenteral nutrition and antibiotics. Biomarkers are molecular indicators of a disease process, diagnosis, prognosis and can be used to monitor the effects of disease management. Historically, there has been a paucity of reliable and robust biomarkers for necrotizing enterocolitis. However, several studies have recently identified promising biomarkers.

A better understanding of the clinical signs and symptoms associated with the disease may result in an improved ability to more effectively intervene in patient care. One of the clinical signs that have not been fully explored is the stooling pattern of preterm infants. This retrospective case-control study included 258 premature infants born prior to 29 weeks of gestation: 129 infants with NEC and 129 gestational age-matched controls. Data were collected from the medical record for the first 28 postnatal days. The relationships between the stooling pattern of premature infants and NEC were assessed via nonparametric techniques and linear mixed models. We identified few differences in the stooling pattern among infants with NEC and their unaffected counterparts. During the first week following birth, infants with NEC passed stool more frequently than controls. However, we found that these infants were taking nothing by mouth for fewer days in the first week following birth compared with controls. We also found that infants who developed NEC were fed smaller proportions of breast milk than healthy controls. Aberrant gut motility has been associated with prematurity and inflammatory bowel disease. However, our analyses did not identify any major differences in the stooling pattern among NEC case patients and controls. While further analyses may be needed, clinical suspicion for NEC should not be overwhelmingly influenced by the stooling pattern observed during the early neonatal period.",

A significant percentage of them become colonized by resistant intestinal bacteria such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) and may transmit the strains to others and to medical care settings when they return home. Despite the threats to global healthcare caused by an upsurge in antimicrobial resistance, no effort has been centered on prevention of colonization while traveling. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 430 Finns before and after traveling outside Scandinavia. All specimens were analyzed for ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Questionnaires were used to survey volunteers about use of antimicrobials as well as other potential risk factors. The results were subjected to multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent (90/430) of the travelers became colonized by ESBL-PE and none by CPE. Geographic region, occurrence of travelers' diarrhea (TD), age, and use of antimicrobial (AB) for TD were identified as independent risk factors predisposing to contracting ESBL-PE. Eleven percent of those in subgroup TD-AB-, 21% in TD+AB-, and 37% in TD+AB+ acquired ESBL-PE. The risk proved to be highest in South Asia (46%); 23% became colonized in subgroup TD-AB-, 47% in TD+AB-, and 80% in TD+AB+. In Southeast Asia, the rates were 14%, 37%, and 69%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TD and antimicrobials for TD proved to be independent risk factors, with up to 80% of TD+AB+ travelers contracting ESBL-PE. In modern pre-travel counseling for those visiting high-risk regions, travelers should be advised against taking antibiotics for mild or moderate TD.",

STUDY DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of children, primarily African American and of low socioeconomic status, that was recruited at birth. FAEEs were quantified with gas chromatography via a flame ionization detector. Meconium was analyzed for FAEEs in 216 newborns; 191 of these infants were assessed for IQ at ages 9, 11, and 15 years with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition. RESULTS: Longitudinal mixed model analyses indicated that, after we controlled for maternal and child covariates, greater concentrations of FAEEs (ethyl myristate, ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate, and ethyl linolenate) were associated with lower Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition Verbal Comprehension Index, Working Memory Index, and Full-Scale IQ scores. Associations of FAEEs with Verbal Comprehension Index, Working Memory Index, and Full-Scale IQ did not vary over time. No associations of FAEEs with Perceptual Reasoning and Processing Speed Indices were found. CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of FAEEs in meconium are potential markers for identifying newborns at risk for poor cognitive development related to prenatal alcohol exposure.",

This study aimed to identify DCC-level risk factors for GE and major enteropathogen occurrence. A dynamic network of 100 and 43 DCCs participated in a syndromic and microbiological surveillance during 2010-2013. The weekly incidence of GE events and weekly prevalence of five major enteropathogens (rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum) were modelled per DCC using mixed-effects negative binomial/Poisson regression models. Sixteen hundred children were surveyed up to 3 years, during which 1829 GE episodes were reported and 5197 faecal samples were analysed. Identified risk factors were: large DCC capacity, crowding, having animals, nappy changing areas, sandpits, paddling pools, cleaning potties in normal sinks, cleaning vomit with paper towels (but without cleaner), mixing of staff between child groups, and staff members with multiple daily duties. Protective factors were: disinfecting fomites with chlorine, cleaning vomit with paper towels (and cleaner), daily cleaning of bed linen/toys, cohorting and exclusion policies for ill children and staff. Targeting these factors may reduce the burden of DCC-related GE.",

			"abstract": "A better understanding of physician practices in requesting stool samples for patients with acute gastroenteritis (AG) is needed to more accurately interpret laboratory-based surveillance data. A survey was conducted in General Practitioners (GPs) between August 2013 and July 2014 to estimate the proportion of stool samples requested for patients with AG and to identify factors associated with GP requests for a stool sample. National health insurance (NHI) data together with surveillance data from a French Sentinel GP network were also used to estimate the proportion of stool samples requested. This proportion was estimated at 4.3% in the GP survey and 9.1% (95% confidence interval 8.7-9.6) using NHI data. Multivariate analysis indicated that the ratio of stool samples requested was almost five times higher in patients with bloody diarrhoea and 10-20 times higher in patients with a long duration of illness before consultation. Laboratory-based surveillance data underestimates the actual burden of disease as fewer than one in 10 AG cases consulting their GP will be requested to submit a stool sample for laboratory testing. This underestimation varies by pathogen as stool samples are more frequently requested for severe illness.",

This study retrospectively analysed 1577 pathogens isolated from inpatients and outpatients in six hospitals located in Northern (Inner Mongolia), Northeastern (Hebei), Eastern (Shanghai and Jiangsu), Southern (Hainan) and Central (Hubei) China between 2008 and 2013. Of the 1577 enteric pathogens, Salmonella presented with the highest frequency (36.0%), followed by diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (23.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.0%), Shigella (13.1%), and Aeromonas (4.6%). The predominant pathogens varied in different regions of China, with Salmonella most prevalent in Shanghai and Hainan, diarrhoeagenic E. coli most prevalent in Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu and Hubei, and Shigella most prevalent in Hebei. Enteric pathogens were more frequently isolated in males (56.9%) than in females (43.1%). The highest proportion of all enteric pathogens was found in infants (67.6%) with a peak in summer and autumn (68.5%). Antimicrobial susceptibility assay demonstrated that Shigella was more resistant to ampicillin, ceftriaxone and sulfamethoxazole than Salmonella. Of the top two serotypes in Salmonella, Typhimurium was more resistant to ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol than Enteritidis (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the resistance rates of Shigella flexneri against ampicillin/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol were significantly higher than those of Shigella sonnei (P < 0.001).

CF is considered a very rare disease in Asians, and fewer than 30 Chinese CF patients are reported in the literature. We enrolled seven patients of Chinese Han origin diagnosed with CF at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, to characterize gene mutations and phenotypes of CF in Chinese patients. METHODS: We analysed the clinical presentation and screened the coding region of the CFTR gene for each patient. RESULTS: Patients were 0-6 years old at onset of symptoms and were 10-28 years old at the time of diagnosis with CF. None of the seven patients had a family history of CF, and only one patient had parents who were consanguineous. Two patients had gastrointestinal symptoms but stool Sudan III results were normal. Four of the seven CF patients also had allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The concentration of chloride in patients' sweat ranged from 66 mmol/l to 154 mmol/l. In total, we identified 11 different mutations in seven CF patients, including one novel mutation ( big up tri, openE7-E11). Only one of these mutations (R553X) is present in the Caucasian CFTR common mutation-screening panel; and none of the 11 mutations are common in Caucasian CF patients. CONCLUSIONS: CF in China is difficult to diagnose because of a combination of low awareness, atypical clinical symptoms, and a lack of sweat and genetic testing facilities in most hospitals. The mutations identified in Chinese CF patients are different from the common Caucasian gene mutations.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meconium drug testing is performed to detect potentially harmful drug exposures in a newborn. Interpretation of meconium drug testing results can be complicated based on the patterns and proportional concentrations of the drug(s) and/or drug metabolite(s) detected. METHODS: The objective of this study was to analyze meconium drug testing patterns in a de-identified dataset from a national reference laboratory (n = 76,631) and in a subset of the data, wherein specimens originated at a single academic medical center for which detailed chart review was possible (n = 3635). Meconium testing was performed using 11 immunoassay-based drug screens. Specimens that were positive for one or more drug screens were reflexed to corresponding confirmation tests performed by gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, targeted to identify and quantitate specific parent drug(s) and metabolite(s). RESULTS: The positivity rate was the highest for the cannabis metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (25.2%, n = 18,643), followed by opiates/oxycodone (23.2%, n = 17,778), amphetamine/methamphetamine (6.7%, n = 5134), cocaine metabolites (5.5%, n = 4205), methadone (5.3%, n = 4093), benzodiazepines (3.4%, n = 2603), barbiturates (1.1%, n = 834), propoxyphene (1.0%, n = 749), and phencyclidine (0.1%, n = 44). Based on documented pharmacy history, drugs administered to either the mother or newborn during the birth hospitalization were detected in meconium, providing evidence that drugs can be incorporated into meconium rapidly. Drugs administered directly to the newborn after birth were recovered in meconium as both parent drug and metabolites, providing evidence of neonatal metabolism. Overall, patterns observed in meconium exhibited many similarities to those patterns commonly reported with urine drug testing. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of meconium drug testing results requires comparison of results with clinical and analytical expectations, including maternal admissions to drug use, pharmacy history, recognized metabolic patterns for drugs of interest, cutoff concentrations, and other performance characteristics of the test. Concentrations of drug(s) and drug metabolites(s) may not reliably predict timing of drug use, extent of drug use, or frequency of drug exposures.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The very-preterm infant gut microbiota is increasingly explored due to its probable role in the development of life threatening diseases. Results of high-throughput studies validate and renew the interest in approaches with lower resolution such as PCR-Temporal Temperature Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE) for the follow-up of dominant microbiota dynamics. We report here an extensive longitudinal study of gut colonization in very preterm infants. We explored by 16S rDNA-based PCR-TTGE a total of 354 stool specimens sampled during routine monitoring from the 1(st) to the 8(th) week of life in 30 very pre-term infants born before 30 weeks of gestational age. RESULTS: Combining comparison with a diversity ladder and sequencing allowed affiliation of 50 Species-Level Operational Taxonomic Units (SLOTUs) as well as semi-quantitative estimation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Coagulase-negative staphylococci, mainly the Staphylococcus epidermidis, was found in all the infants during the study period and was the most represented (75.7% of the SLOTUs) from the first days of life. Enterococci, present in 60% of the infants were early, highly represented and persistent colonizers of the premature gut. Later Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Clostridium appeared and were found in 10 (33%) and 21 infants (70%), respectively. We showed a high representation of Veillonella in more than a quarter of the infants and being able to persistently colonize premature gut. The genera Anaerococcus, Aquabacterium, Bacillus, Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus, Oceanobacillus, Propionibacterium, Pseudomonas, Rothia, Sarcina, Sneathia and Streptococcus were observed as transient or persistent colonizers, each genus being found in a minority of infants. CONCLUSIONS: Despite low resolution, PCR-TTGE remains complementary to high-throughput sequencing-based approaches because it allows the follow-up of dominant bacteria in gut microbiota in a large longitudinal cohorts of preterm neonates. We described the development of pre-term gut microbiota that should be now replaced regarding the functional role of major OTUs.",

This study evaluated growth and safety in infants fed formula supplemented with a mixture of bovine milk-derived oligosaccharides (BMOS). This mixture, which was generated from whey permeate, contains galactooligosaccharides and other oligosaccharides from bovine milk, such as 3'- and 6'-sialyllactose. We hypothesized that growth in infants fed BMOS-supplemented formula would be noninferior to that in infants fed standard formula. METHODS: Healthy term infants </=14 days old were randomly assigned to standard formula (control; n = 84); standard formula with BMOS (IF-BMOS; n = 99); or standard formula with BMOS and probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus) (IF-BMOS + Pro; n = 98). A breastfed reference group was also enrolled (n = 30). The primary outcome was mean weight gain/day from enrollment to age 4 months (noninferiority margin: -3.0 g/day). RESULTS: 189 (67.3%) formula-fed infants were included in the primary analysis. Mean differences in weight gain between the control and IF-BMOS and IF-BMOS + Pro groups were <1 g/day, with 97.5% confidence intervals above -3.0 g/day, indicating noninferior weight gain in the BMOS formula groups. Compared with control, infants in the BMOS groups had more frequent (p < 0.0001) and less hard (p = 0.0003) stools. No significant differences were observed between the control and BMOS groups in caregivers' reports of flatulence, vomiting, spitting up, crying, fussing, and colic. When based on clinical evaluation by the investigator, the incidence of colic was higher (p = 0.01) in IF-BMOS than in control; the incidence of investigator-diagnosed colic was not significantly different in control and IF-BMOS + Pro (p = 0.15). Stool bifidobacteria and lactobacilli counts were higher with IF-BMOS + Pro compared with control (p < 0.05), whereas Clostridia counts were lower (p < 0.05) in both BMOS groups compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Infant formula containing BMOS either with or without probiotics provides adequate nutrition for normal growth in healthy term infants. Further studies are needed to fully explore the digestive tolerance of BMOS formula. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01886898 . Registered 24 June 2013.",

METHODS: We followed a community-based birth cohort of 194 children in Ecuador with the aim to estimate (1) the incidence of norovirus gastroenteritis from birth to age 3 years, (2) the protective effect of norovirus infection against subsequent infection/disease, and (3) the association of infection and disease with FUT2 secretor status. RESULTS: Over the 3-year period, we detected a mean of 2.26 diarrheal episodes per child (range, 0-12 episodes).

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The present study, conducted between January 2004 and April 2007, explored the impact of household hygiene on the risk of bacterial diarrhea, using data from a prospective birth cohort of 348 infants in five villages in the Nile Delta in Egypt. METHODOLOGY: Neonates were enrolled at birth and followed up until 24 months of age. Children were visited twice a week to survey them for acute diarrhea. A detailed observational household hygiene survey was completed in-house every six months. Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of developing bacterial diarrhea was calculated for exposure to different hygiene variables and examined for specific bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Exclusive breastfeeding reduced the risk of bacterial diarrhea by 70%, while bacterial diarrhea cases were 2.6 times higher in the warm season. Risk of Campylobacter diarrhea increased with the absence of barriers to keep birds and animals out of the eating area, the presence of garbage containers and a bathing facility within the compound, and the presence of feces on the floor of the bathing facility. Use of municipal water for drinking and cooking was associated with a lower risk of Campylobacter diarrhea. Risk of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhea increased with uncovered garbage containers and the presence of liquid materials in the garbage containers, but decreased with the use of tap water in the washing facility. CONCLUSION: The results highlight some potential targets for interventions, such as expanding municipal water supply to all houses and comprehensive mass-media awareness programs to change hygiene-promoting behaviors and practices.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus (HAdV) causes acute diarrhoea sporadically, as well as in outbreaks. Understanding the prevalence and types of HAdV in diarrhoea is important for control and preventive measures, especially in the African region where there is a high burden of diarrhoeal disease. The present study assessed the prevalence, molecular characteristics, seasonality and associated clinical features of HAdV infection Tanzanian children below two years of age with and without diarrhoea between 2010-2011. METHODS: Stool specimens, demographic and clinical information were collected in 690 cases and 545 controls. All stool samples were screened for HAdV-antigen using ELISA. Positive samples subsequently underwent real-time PCR and sequencing for molecular typing. RESULTS: HAdV was detected in 37 children, corresponding to a prevalence of 3.5% (24/690) in diarrhoeic and 2.4% (13/545) in non-diarrhoeic children (P > 0.05). Among HAdV-infected children, the median age was significantly lower in diarrhoeic than in non-diarrhoeic children (10 vs. 14 months, P<0.001). More than half of HAdV infected (54.2%) were dehydrated as compared to diarrhoeic children without HAdV (45.8%, P = 0.01). The proportion of the enteric HAdV type 40/41 in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic children was (50.0%, 12/24) and (46.2%, 6/13) respectively. Other HAdV types detected were; 1, 2, 7, 18, 19 and 31. The prevalence of adenovirus was not significantly different between rainy and dry seasons. HAdV was not detected in the 33 known HIV positive children. There was no significant association between HAdV infection and gender, nutritional status of the child and parent educational level. CONCLUSION: The present study provides further evidence of the contribution of adenovirus in causing gastroenteritis in young children, with symptomatic infection being significantly more prevalent in children below one year. We found similar prevalence of adenovirus in non-diarrhoeic children and in diarrhoeic children. This first report on molecular epidemiology of human adenovirus in Tanzania observed diversity of HAdV types that circulate the study setting. The study findings suggest that HAdV is not an important cause of diarrhoea in young HIV-positive children.",

			"abstract": "Human fecal samples contain endogenous human metabolites, gut microbiota metabolites, and other compounds. Profiling the fecal metabolome can produce metabolic information that may be used not only for disease biomarker discovery, but also for providing an insight about the relationship of the gut microbiome and human health. In this work, we report a chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the amine- and phenol-containing metabolites in fecal samples. Differential (13)C2/(12)C2-dansyl labeling of the amines and phenols was used to improve LC separation efficiency and MS detection sensitivity. Water, methanol, and acetonitrile were examined as an extraction solvent, and a sequential water-acetonitrile extraction method was found to be optimal. A step-gradient LC-UV setup and a fast LC-MS method were evaluated for measuring the total concentration of dansyl labeled metabolites that could be used for normalizing the sample amounts of individual samples for quantitative metabolomics. Knowing the total concentration was also useful for optimizing the sample injection amount into LC-MS to maximize the number of metabolites detectable while avoiding sample overloading. For the first time, dansylation isotope labeling LC-MS was performed in a simple time-of-flight mass spectrometer, instead of high-end equipment, demonstrating the feasibility of using a low-cost instrument for chemical isotope labeling metabolomics. The developed method was applied for profiling the amine/phenol submetabolome of fecal samples collected from three families. An average of 1785 peak pairs or putative metabolites were found from a 30 min LC-MS run. From 243 LC-MS runs of all the fecal samples, a total of 6200 peak pairs were detected. Among them, 67 could be positively identified based on the mass and retention time match to a dansyl standard library, while 581 and 3197 peak pairs could be putatively identified based on mass match using MyCompoundID against a Human Metabolome Database and an Evidence-based Metabolome Library, respectively. This represents the most comprehensive profile of the amine/phenol submetabolome ever detected in human fecal samples. The quantitative metabolome profiles of individual samples were shown to be useful to separate different groups of samples, illustrating the possibility of using this method for fecal metabolomics studies.",

Co-infections were identified in 3.7% of the study population and 23.5% of HBoV-positive specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 14 HBoV strains to be clustered into species HBoV1 with only minor variations among them. Overall, the detection of HBoV appears to partially contribute to the overall detection gap for enteric infections, single HBoV infection rarely results in severe clinical outcomes, and HBoV sequencing data appears to support conserved genomes across strains identified in this study.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intussusception, a condition where one segment of intestine invaginates into another, occurs predominantly in infants and young children. A number of potential causes have been identified including infectious agents and rotavirus vaccination. Following the introduction of rotavirus vaccination of infants in Western Australia, a laboratory surveillance programme testing notified intussusception cases for infectious agents was commenced. This led to a PCR-based study of the association between gastrointestinal viruses and intussusception. OBJECTIVES: Conduct viral testing on stool samples from intussusception patients to determine viruses that may have an association with intussusception. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using stool samples collected from children with intussusception (n=74) and matched controls (n=289) between 2008 and 2011. Samples were tested for rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, astrovirus, parechovirus and bocavirus. Adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus species were determined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Human adenovirus C was detected in significantly more cases than controls with 31/74 (41.9%) cases testing positive compared to 39/289 (13.49%) controls (OR=4.38, p<0.001). A significant difference was seen in Enterovirus B detections with 11/74 (14.9%) cases testing positive compared to 21/289 (7.3%) controls (OR=2.24, p=0.04). Rotavirus was detected in 7/74 (9.46%) cases and 11/289 (3.81%) controls, which was also a significant difference (OR=2.88, p=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that intussusception is associated with non-enteric adenovirus infections, and Enterovirus B infections. While a statistical association was seen with rotavirus and intussusception, we were not able to determine if this was related to vaccine strain or wild type rotavirus.",

Several studies in the past have detected and quantified tobacco smoke biomarkers in infant meconium samples. Aim of this study was to measure prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke by detecting nicotine and cotinine in meconium and to try to evaluate the extent of exposure to smoke through passive smoking as well as the relationship between tobacco biomarker meconium concentrations and neonatal outcomes. Tobacco smoke biomarkers nicotine and cotinine were detected and quantitated in meconium from tobacco exposed and non-exposed Greek neonates using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The study included 45 neonates from active, passive and non-smoking women during pregnancy. The results showed significant values of nicotine and cotinine concentration in neonates from both active and passive smokers which reached 125 ng g(-1) for nicotine and 98.5 ng g(-1) for cotinine and varied according to the type and level of exposure. In general nicotine and cotinine concentrations correlated with the degree of active smoking by the mother. Similarly, nicotine and cotinine were measured in the meconium of infants of passive smokers at concentrations comparable to those of infants whose mothers were moderate smokers. Our findings show that exposure of the fetus to tobacco biomarkers can be substantial even in passive maternal smoking and there is a statistically significant negative correlation between nicotine or cotinine concentrations in meconium and birth weight or gestational age at birth.",

			"abstract": "PURPOSE: Meconium is a biomarker matrix that can be used to assess cumulative exposures in epidemiologic studies of prenatal risk factors. Depending on when meconium is collected, different exposure windows during pregnancy can be measured. However, little guidance exists regarding the extent to which timing of meconium collection will influence resulting effect estimates. METHODS: We performed a simulation study of prenatal tobacco smoke exposure (assessed from meconium nicotine) and birth weight. We discuss four typical meconium collection methods capturing different exposure windows and assess the biases induced by these methods. RESULTS: In simulations assuming that exposure to tobacco smoke only during late gestation was of etiologic relevance to birth weight, use of a meconium collection method that captured exposure windows other than late gestation resulted in biased estimates of the true nicotine-birth weight association. CONCLUSIONS: Using meconium collection methods that do not reflect an exposure window of etiologic relevance can lead to biased results and erroneous conclusions regarding the nature of prenatal exposure-outcome associations. Understanding how prenatal exposure patterns vary across the pregnancy and exposure windows of etiologic relevance is essential in determining when and how to collect meconium for use in biomarker studies of prenatal exposure.",

			"abstract": "In a cross sectional study, we show that infants who received single dose of live attenuated OPV and BCG vaccines within 48h of birth, have higher excretion of human cathelicidin LL37 (p<0.05) in stool at 6wk of age. This response remained unchanged in multivariate analysis after adjusting for sex, mode of delivery, infant age, mother age birth weight and breast milk feeding pattern. This analysis also reveals that irrespective of vaccination, girl infants have higher human-beta-defencin2 (HBD2) and exclusively breastfed infants have higher total and anti-polio specific IgA to all three subtypes in stool (p<0.05). However, vaccination induces anti-polio IgA responses only to infants who are exclusively breastfed. Thus on-birth live attenuated vaccination may provide non-specific beneficial effect against infections while exclusive breastfeeding enhance protection by boosting vaccine induced IgA. The result also suggests that in polio endemic area, exclusive breastfeeding may be sufficient for mucosal anti-polio responses during early infancy.",

This cross-sectional, hospital-based surveillance study (NCT01201252) was designed to investigate RVGE disease burden. It was conducted from July 2009-July 2010 at 3 referral hospitals in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Children who had been hospitalized for acute GE were enrolled with informed consent. Stool samples were tested for RV using enzyme immunoassay and RV-positive samples were further typed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization to determine the G and P types. GE data were collected from medical charts and GE severity was assessed through clinical examination. Treatment and outcome were prospectively recorded. Among 6323 children hospitalized due to any reason, 771 (12.2%) presented acute GE and were enrolled, of whom 758 (98.3%) were included in the final analysis. Acute GE and RVGE accounted for 12.0% (758/6323) and 6.0% (381/6323) of all hospitalizations, respectively. RVGE accounted for 50.3% (381/758) of GE hospitalizations and predominantly affected, children younger than 2 years (66.1%; 252/381). The severity of GE before hospitalization was significantly associated with RV-positive status (P = 0.0031). The majority (>95%) of children received intravenous hydration during hospitalization. RVGE occurred throughout the year, with a subtle winter peak in February 2010 (63.6%; 56/88). G1WTP[8]WT was the most commonly detected RV strain (56.3%) in 268 analyzed samples.

As a result of the cholera outbreak that spread throughout PNG in 2009-2011, we conducted diarrhoeal surveillance in Eastern Highlands Province. METHODOLOGY: Following informed consent and a brief questionnaire, participants provided a stool sample or duplicate rectal swabs. Samples were tested for common bacterial pathogens Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Campylobacter spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica using established culture methods. Enteric parasites were detected using microscopy. RESULTS: A total of 216 participants were enrolled; where age was recorded, 42% were under 5 years of age, 6.7% were 5 to 17 years of age and 51.3% >/=18 years of age. One or more pathogens were detected in 68 (31.5%) participants, with Shigella (primarily S. flexneri) being the most commonly isolated (47 of 216 participants). Enteric parasites were detected in 23 of the 216 participants, occurring as a co-infection with another pathogen in 12 of 23 cases. No Vibrio cholerae was detected. Shigella isolates were commonly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol. CONCLUSIONS: Shigellae, specifically S. flexneri, are important pathogens in the highlands of PNG. While most studies in low-income settings focus on childhood aetiology, we have demonstrated the importance of Shigella in both children and adults. Enteric parasites remain present and presumably contribute to the burden of gastrointestinal illness. While improvements in sanitation and hygiene would help lower the burden of all aetiologies of infectious diarrhoea, additional control strategies targeting Shigella may also be warranted.",

			"article_name": "Antibiotics for meconium-stained amniotic fluid in labour for preventing maternal and neonatal infections.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis is more likely to occur when meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is present. Meconium may enhance the growth of bacteria in amniotic fluid by serving as a growth factor, inhibiting bacteriostatic properties of amniotic fluid. Many adverse neonatal outcomes related to MSAF result from meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). MSAF is associated with both maternal and newborn infections. Antibiotics may be an effective option to reduce such morbidity. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and side effects of prophylactic antibiotics for MSAF during labour in preventing maternal and neonatal infections. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment during labour for women with MSAF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies with 362 pregnant women. Both studies compared ampicillin-sulbactam (N = 183) versus normal saline (N = 179) in pregnant women with MSAF. Prophylactic antibiotics appeared to have no statistically significant reduction in the incidence of neonatal sepsis (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.76), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.78) and postpartum endometritis (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.38). However, there was a significant decrease in the risk of chorioamnionitis (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.62). No serious adverse effects were reported. Drug resistance, duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of admission to NICU/hospital were not reported. Most of the domains for risk of bias were at low risk of bias for one study and at unclear risk of bias for the other study. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was low for neonatal sepsis, postpartum endometritis, and neonatal mortality and morbidity prior to discharge (Neonatal intensive care admissions) and of moderate quality for chorioamnionitis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence indicates that compared to placebo, antibiotics for MSAF in labour may reduce chorioamnionitis. There was no evidence that antibiotics could reduce postpartum endometritis, neonatal sepsis and NICU admission. This systematic review identifies the need for more well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to assess the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in the incidence of maternal and neonatal complications.",

Feeding high sn-2 palmitate or the prebiotic oligofructose (OF) may soften stools, reduce stool soaps, and decrease fecal calcium loss. METHODS: We investigated the effect of high sn-2 palmitate alone and in combination with OF on stool palmitate soap, total soap and calcium concentrations, stool consistency, gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance, anthropometrics, and hydration in FF infants. This double-blind trial randomized 165 healthy term infants 25-45 days old to receive Control formula (n = 54), formula containing high sn-2 palmitate (sn-2; n = 56), or formula containing high sn-2 palmitate plus 3 g/L OF (sn-2+OF; n = 55). A non-randomized human milk (HM)-fed group was also included (n = 55). The primary endpoint, stool composition, was determined after 28 days of feeding, and was assessed using ANOVA accompanied by pairwise comparisons. Stool consistency, GI tolerance and hydration were assessed at baseline, day 14 (GI tolerance only) and day 28. RESULTS: Infants fed sn-2 had lower stool palmitate soaps compared to Control (P = 0.0028); while those fed sn-2+OF had reduced stool palmitate soaps compared to both Control and sn-2 (both P < 0.0001). Stool total soaps and calcium were lower in the sn-2+OF group than either Control (P < 0.0001) or sn-2 (P < 0.0001). The HM-fed group had lower stool palmitate soaps, total soaps and calcium (P < 0.0001 for each comparison) than all FF groups. The stool consistency score of the sn-2+OF group was lower than Control and sn-2 (P < 0.0001), but higher than the HM-fed group (P < 0.0001). GI tolerance was similar and anthropometric z-scores were <0.2 SD from the WHO growth standards in all groups, while urinary hydration markers were within normal range for all FF infants. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing sn-2 palmitate in infant formula reduces stool palmitate soaps. A combination of high sn-2 palmitate and OF reduces stool palmitate soaps, total soaps and calcium, while promoting softer stools.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The symptoms observed in children with human parechovirus (HPeV) infection vary widely from asymptomatic or mild gastrointestinal infections to more severe central nervous system infections and sepsis-like disease. Many of the disease associations are, however, only suggestive. In this study, we examined the connection between HPeV and acute otitis media, lower respiratory infections and suspected central nervous system infections. METHODS: An HPeV specific real-time reverese transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to detect HPeV RNA. We analyzed altogether 200 middle-ear fluid samples, 192 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 79 cerebrospinal fluid specimens and 50 serum and 5 fecal or fecal culture samples. Positive samples were typed by sequencing the VP1 region. RESULTS: Seven (8%) of 85 children with suspected central nervous system infections were positive for HPeV. Of these, 4 (all in autumn 2012 and from children <3 months of age) were typed to be HPeV4, whereas 1 child had HPeV3. HPeV4 was detected from stool, serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The children with acute otitis media tested HPeV positive in 2.5% episodes. In the lower respiratory cases, HPeV was absent. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported in this study suggest that HPeV4 can cause sepsis-like disease in young infants and be present in cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, this report shows that HPeV findings in children with more severe symptoms occur also in Finland.",

Thus, to investigate lipid digestion and absorption and mimic the situation in newborns, a young porcine exocrine pancreatic insufficient (EPI) model was adapted and validated in the present study. A total of thirteen EPI pigs, aged 8 weeks old, were randomised into three groups and fed either a milk-based formula or a milk-based formula supplemented with either bacterial or fungal lipase. Digestion and absorption of fat was directly correlated with the addition of lipases as demonstrated by a 30% increase in the coefficient of fat absorption. In comparison to the control group, a 40 and 25% reduction in total fat content and 26 and 45% reduction in n-3 and n-6 fatty acid (FA) content in the stool was observed for lipases 1 and 2, respectively. Improved fat absorption was reflected in the blood levels of lipid parameters. During the experiment, only a very slight gain in body weight was observed in EPI piglets, which can be explained by the absence of pancreatic protease and amylase in the gastrointestinal tract. This is similar to newborn babies that have reduced physiological function of exocrine pancreas. In conclusion, we postulate that the EPI pig model fed with infant formula mimics the growth and lipid digestion and absorption in human neonates and can be used to elucidate further importance of fat and FA in the development and growth of newborns, as well as for testing novel formula compositions.",

			"abstract": "The salivary scavenger and agglutinin (SALSA), also known as gp340 and dmbt1, is an antimicrobial and inflammation-regulating molecule located at the mucosal surfaces. The present study revealed that SALSA was present in the amniotic fluid (AF) and exceptionally enriched in both meconium and feces of infants. Based on immunological and mass spectrometric analysis, SALSA was estimated to constitute up to 4-10% of the total protein amount in meconium, making it one of the most abundant proteins. SALSA proteins in the AF and intestinal samples were polymorphic and exhibited varying polypeptide compositions. In particular, a different abundance of peptides corresponding to functionally important structures was found in the AF and intestinal SALSA. The AF form of SALSA had a more intact structure and contained peptides from the zona pellucida domain, which is involved in cell differentiation and oligomerization. In contrast, the intestinal SALSA was more enriched with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. The AF, but not the meconium SALSA, bound to Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. gordonii, and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, differential binding was observed also to known endogenous ligands C1q, mannose-binding lectin, and secretory IgA. Our results have thus identified mucosal body compartments, where SALSA is particularly abundant, and suggest that SALSA exhibits varying functions in the different mucosal locations. The high levels of SALSA in AF and the infant intestine suggest a robust and important function for SALSA during the fetal development and in the mucosal innate immune defense of infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) began polio eradication activities in 1996. By 2001, DRC was no longer polio endemic. However, wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission was reestablished in 2006 continuing through 2011 (last WPV case onset 20 December 2011), and vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) outbreaks occurred during 2004-2012 (last VDPV2 case onset 4 April 2012). Gaps in acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance have been consistently documented. METHODS: AFP surveillance indicators were assessed at the national, provincial, and zone de sante (ZS) levels for 2010-2012. A spatiotemporal analysis of compatible, WPV type 1 (WPV1), and VDPV2 cases was performed. RESULTS: During 2010-2012, AFP cases were reported from all provinces but not every ZS, particularly in Equateur province and Province Orientale. A spatiotemporal relationship between compatible, WPV1, and VDPV2 cases was noted. Nonpolio AFP rates met objectives at national and provincial levels but were sub-optimal in certain ZS. National and provincial trends in timely stool collection, stool condition, adequate stool, and 60-day follow-up exams improved. CONCLUSIONS: DRC's AFP surveillance system is functional and improved during 2010-2012. Maintaining improvements and strengthening AFP case detection at the ZS level will provide further support for the apparent interruption of WPV and VDPV2 transmission.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persons with primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDD) who receive oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) may transmit immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) and cause paralytic polio. The objective of this study was to identify children with PIDD in Bangladesh, and estimate the proportion with chronic poliovirus excretion. METHODS: Patients admitted at 5 teaching hospitals were screened for PIDD according to standardized clinical case definitions. PIDD was confirmed by age-specific quantitative immunoglobulin levels. Stool specimens were collected from patients with confirmed PIDD. RESULTS: From February 2011 through January 2013, approximately 96 000 children were screened, and 53 patients were identified who met the clinical case definition for PIDD. Thirteen patients (24%) had age-specific quantitative immunoglobulins results that confirmed PIDD. Of these, 9 (69%) received OPV 3-106 months before stool specimen collection. Among 11 patients, stool specimens from 1 patient tested positive for polioviruses 34 months after OPV ingestion. However, the poliovirus isolate was not available for genetic sequencing, and a subsequent stool specimen 45 days later was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of chronic poliovirus excretion among children with PIDD in Bangladesh seems to be low. The national polio eradication program should incorporate strategies for screening for poliovirus excretion among patients with PIDD.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2009, enhanced poliovirus surveillance was established in polio-endemic areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India, to assess poliovirus infection in older individuals. METHODS: In Uttar Pradesh, stool specimens from asymptomatic household and neighborhood contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed polio were tested for polioviruses. In Bihar, in community-based surveillance, children and adults from 250 randomly selected households in the Kosi River area provided stool and pharyngeal swab samples that were tested for polioviruses. A descriptive analysis of surveillance data was performed. RESULTS: In Uttar Pradesh, 89 of 1842 healthy contacts of case patients with polio (4.8%) were shedding wild poliovirus (WPV); 54 of 85 (63.5%) were >/=5 years of age. Shedding was significantly higher in index households than in neighborhood households (P<.05). In Bihar, 11 of 451 healthy persons (2.4%) were shedding WPV in their stool; 6 of 11 (54.5%) were >/=5 years of age. Mean viral titer was similar in older and younger children. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of persons>/=5 years of age were asymptomatically shedding polioviruses. These findings provide indirect evidence that older individuals could have contributed to community transmission of WPV in India. Polio vaccination campaigns generally target children<5 years of age. Expanding this target age group in polio-endemic areas could accelerate polio eradication.",

			"abstract": "Infant colic is a common gastrointestinal disorder of newborns, mostly related to imbalances in the composition of gut microbiota and particularly to the presence of gas-producing coliforms and to lower levels of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli. Probiotics could help to contain this disturbance, with formulations consisting of Lactobacillus strains being the most utilized. In this work, the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium breve B632 that was specifically selected for its ability to inhibit gas-producing coliforms, was challenged against the Enterobacteriaceae within continuous cultures of microbiota from a 2-month-old colicky infant. As confirmed by RAPD-PCR fingerprinting, B. breve B632 persisted in probiotic-supplemented microbiota cultures, accounting for the 64% of Bifidobacteria at the steady state. The probiotic succeeded in inhibiting coliforms, since FISH and qPCR revealed that the amount of Enterobacteriaceae after 18 h of cultivation was 0.42 and 0.44 magnitude orders lower (P < 0.05) in probiotic-supplemented microbiota cultures than in the control ones. These results support the possibility to move to another level of study, that is, the administration of B. breve B632 to a cohort of colicky newborns, in order to observe the behavior of this strain in vivo and to validate its effect in colic treatment.",

			"abstract": "Human milk is considered to be the optimal source of infant nutrition. Some of the benefits of breastfeeding have been ascribed to human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). For instance, HMO can affect faecal characteristics such as stool consistency and stool frequency. Such effects on stool characteristics can be beneficial for young infants as hard stools and even constipation is common in that age group. Prebiotics in infant milk formulas have been introduced to exert similar functionalities. A specific mixture of prebiotics consists of a combination of short chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS) in a ratio of 9:1. This specific mixture has been developed to closely resemble the molecular size composition of HMO. Many studies have been done with scGOS/lcFOS, and indicators for digestive comfort have often been included as secondary outcomes. This review summarizes the effects of scGOS/lcFOS (9:1) on stool consistency, stool frequency and transit time in healthy term and preterm infants. In several of the studies with scGOS/lcFOS in a ratio of 9:1 in infant milk formulas, positive effects of this mixture on stool characteristics such as stool consistency and stool frequency were observed. As stool consistency was shown to be correlated to whole gut transit time, scGOS/lcFOS can be hypothesised to have a role in reducing the risk of constipation.",

Ventilatory pressures, oxygenation, right-to-left pulmonary shunts, and leukocyte count were measured. At the end of experiment, trachea and lung were excised. The left lung was saline-lavaged and a total and differential count of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was determined. Right lung tissue strips were used for detection of lung edema (expressed as wet/dry weight ratio) and peroxidation (expressed by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS). In lung and tracheal strips, airway reactivity to acetylcholine was measured. In addition, TBARS and total antioxidant status were determined in the plasma. Meconium instillation induced polymorphonuclear-derived inflammation and oxidative stress. N-acetylcysteine improved oxygenation, reduced lung edema, decreased polymorphonuclears in BAL fluid, and diminished peroxidation and meconium-induced airway hyperreactivity compared with untreated animals.

Oxidation markers (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and total antioxidant status) and aldosterone, as a non-specific marker of cardiovascular injury, were determined in plasma. Meconium instillation did not evoke any significant cardiovascular changes, but induced oxidative stress and elevated plasma aldosterone. N-acetylcysteine significantly reduced the mentioned markers of injury. However, its administration was associated with short-term increases in blood pressure and in several parameters of heart rate variability. Considering these effects of N-acetylcysteine, its intravenous administration in newborns with MAS should be carefully monitored.",

			"abstract": "Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) play a key role in shaping and maintaining a healthy infant gut microbiota. This article demonstrates the potential of combining recent advances in glycomics and genomics to correlate abundances of fecal microbes and fecal HMOs. Serial fecal specimens from two healthy breast-fed infants were analyzed by bacterial DNA sequencing to characterize the microbiota and by mass spectrometry to determine abundances of specific HMOs that passed through the intestinal tract without being consumed by the luminal bacteria. In both infants, the fecal bacterial population shifted from non-HMO-consuming microbes to HMO-consuming bacteria during the first few weeks of life. An initial rise in fecal HMOs corresponded with bacterial populations composed primarily of non-HMO-consuming Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaeae. This was followed by decreases in fecal HMOs as the proportion of HMO-consuming Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae increased. Analysis of HMO structures with isomer differentiation revealed that HMO consumption is highly structure-specific, with unique isomers being consumed and others passing through the gut unaltered. These results represent a proof-of-concept and are consistent with the highly selective, prebiotic effect of HMOs in shaping the gut microbiota in the first weeks of life. The analysis of selective fecal bacterial substrates as a measure of alterations in the gut microbiota may be a potential marker of dysbiosis.",

From January 2007 to December 2009, 545 mother-infant pairs were recruited. The geometric mean concentrations of Pb and As in the meconium of babies of foreign-born mothers (22.9 and 38.1 microg/kg dry weight, respectively) were significantly greater than those of babies of Taiwan-born mothers (17.5 and 33.0 microg/kg dry weight, respectively). Maternal age (>/=30 y), maternal education, use of traditional Chinese herbs during pregnancy, and fish cutlet consumption (>/=3 meals/wk) were risk factors associated with concentrations of key prenatal neurotoxins. The Taiwan government should focus more attention on providing intervention programs for immigrant mothers to help protect the health of unborn babies.

Six-month-old infants in anthroposophic families had a significantly higher abundance of Bifidobacterium and lower abundances of Bacteroides and Veillonella. Caesarean section and breastfeeding had a significant impact on the microbiota: caesarean section was primarily associated with delayed colonization of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, whereas breastfed children had a higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and a lower abundance of Clostridiales. However, despite large differences in lifestyle exposures, we determined no significant differences in the gut microbiota between the anthroposophic and non-anthroposophic mothers or their infants' before 6 months of age.",

RESULTS: Enteroscopically the white villi type (n = 8) showed white plaques and white-tipped villi were scattered in the small bowel, while non-white villi type (n = 6) showed that apparently normal but under more detailed observation, low and round villi with a normal color were diffused. The serum albumin levels and fecal alpha1-antitrypsin clearance before treatment were significantly worse in the non-white villi type (p = 0.017 and 0.039, respectively), whereas the serum immunoglobulin A and M levels were significantly lower in the white villi type (p = 0.010 and 0.046, respectively). At gastroscopy, a non-cirrhotic snakeskin appearance was significantly observed in the non-white villi type (p = 0.015).

OBJECTIVE: We analyzed seasonality and genotypic pattern for sporadic cases by norovirus GII-4 variants. STUDY DESIGN: To determine the epidemic status of GII.4 variants in South Korea during 2006-2013, 7301 fecal specimens were collected from children who were younger than 5 years and had sporadic acute gastroenteritis (AGE). RESULTS: During the study period, NoVs were the most prevalent viral agent, detected in 877 (12.0%) of the 7301 fecal specimens from children with sporadic AGE. NoV GII strains predominantly accounted for 97.6% of all sporadic NoV infections. NoV GII.4 was the most prevalent genotype and comprised 67.6% of the NoV GII strains. However, seasonal prevalence of GII.4 strains varied depending on the spread of GII.4 variants. GII.4-2006b variant most predominantly circulated from 2006-2007 to 2009-2010 and persisted during other seasons. GII.4-2009 variant was first detected in January 2010 and predominant in 2011-2012. However, it was rapidly displaced by GII.4-2012 variant, which emerged in May 2012 and substantially circulated in 2012-2013. CONCLUSIONS: The frequent emergence and rapid spread of GII.4 variants significantly affect the magnitude of sporadic NoV infections in children. Hence, to minimize the disease burden of NoV infections, GII.4 strains should be considered as a primary target for vaccine development against NoVs.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biliary atresia (BA) is the leading cause of pediatric end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in the United States. Early diagnosis leads to improved outcomes, but diagnosis is often delayed, leading to increased rates of transplantation and mortality. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the natural history and transplant-related outcomes of patients with BA in a US cohort studied for 20 years. Data regarding proportions of individuals in different health states, including transplant and death, were obtained from published literature. Costs were derived from the literature and the Johns Hopkins database of charges using the cost-to-charge ratio. Strategy A represented the status quo and assumed no screening. Strategy B used nationwide screening with the stool color card developed by the Taiwan Health Bureau. The cost associated with both strategies was compared with the number of life-years gained, deaths, and the number of transplants for a 20-year interval. A dominant strategy was one that was associated with lower cost alongside improved outcomes, including increases in life-years gained, reductions in number of deaths, and reductions in number of transplants. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In strategy A, the 20-year cost was $142,479,725 with 3702 life-years, 74 deaths and 158 liver transplants. For strategy B, the cost was $133,893,563 with 3731.7 life-years, 71 deaths and 147 liver transplants. There was a >97% probability that screening with the stool color card would be cost saving and associated with an increase in life-years gained. Among all parameters, only stool color card specificity was associated with the potential for screening to no longer be cost saving. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with no screening, screening with the stool color card is a dominant strategy associated with lower costs and better outcomes. These findings suggest that screening with the stool color card could be an important, economically feasible strategy for improving outcomes in BA in the United States.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: An increasing number of studies that are using high-throughput molecular methods are rapidly extending our knowledge of gut microbial colonization in preterm infants whose immaturity and requirement for extensive treatment may result in altered colonization process. We aimed to describe the profile of gut microbiota in 50 extremely low birth weight (<1200 g) critically ill infants at three different time points during the first two months of life by using 16S rRNA gene specific sequencing.   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool samples were collected at the age of one week, one month and two months. Bacterial community profiling was done using universal amplification of 16S rRNA gene and 454 pyrosequencing. RESULTS: The diversity of gut microbiota in preterm neonates in the first week of life was low but increased significantly over two months. The gut microbiota was dominated by facultative anaerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae) and lacked colonization with bacteria known to provide resistance against pathogens (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus) throughout the study. Colonization of Escherichia coli and uncultured Veillionella was positively correlated with maturity. Infants born to mothers with chorioamnionitis had significantly higher bacterial diversity than those without. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence and abundance of potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae with low prevalence and abundance of colonization resistance providing taxa bifidobacteria, Bacteroides and lactobacilli may lead to high infection risk via microbial translocation from the gut. Additionally, our data suggest that maternal chorioamnionitis may have an effect on the diversity of infants' gut microbiota; however, the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated.",

			"abstract": "This article presents results from 47 meconium samples, which were analyzed for fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) for detection of gestational alcohol consumption. A validated microwave assisted extraction (MAE) method in combination with GC-MS developed in the Institute of Forensic Science (Santiago de Compostela) was used for FAEE and the cumulative concentration of ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate and ethyl stearate with a cut-off of 600ng/g was applied for interpretation. A simple method for identification and quantification of EtG has been evaluated by ultrasonication followed solid phase extraction (SPE). Successful validation parameters were obtained for both biochemical markers of alcohol intake. FAEE and EtG concentrations in meconium ranged between values lower than LOD and 32,892ng/g or 218ng/g respectively. We have analyzed FAEE and EtG in the same meconium aliquot, enabling comparison of the efficiency of gestational ethanol exposure detection. Certain agreement between the two biomarkers was found as they are both a very specific alcohol markers, making it a useful analysis for confirmation.",

			"abstract": "Probiotics, defined as living bacteria that are beneficial for human health, mainly function through their immunomodulatory abilities. Hence, these microorganisms have proven successful for treating diseases resulting from immune deregulation. The aim of this study was to find novel candidates to improve on and complement current probiotic treatment strategies. Of 60 lactic acid bacterial strains that were isolated from fecal samples of healthy, full-term, breast-fed infants, three were chosen because of their ability to activate human immune cells. These candidates were then tested with regard to immunomodulatory properties, antimicrobial effects on pathogens, required pharmacological properties and their safety profiles. To identify the immunomodulatory structures of the selected isolates, activation of specific innate immune receptors was studied. The three candidates for probiotic treatment were assigned Enterococcus faecium NM113, Enterococcus faecium NM213 and Lactobacillus casei NM512. Compared with the established allergy-protective strain Lactococcus lactis G121, these isolates induced release of similar amounts of IL-12, a potent inducer of T helper 1 cells. In addition, all three neonatal isolates had antimicrobial activity against pathogens. Analysis of pharmacological suitability showed high tolerance of low pH, bile salts and pancreatic enzymes. In terms of safe application in humans, the isolates were sensitive to three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin). In addition, the Enterococcus isolates were free from the four major virulence genes (cylA, agg, efaAfs and ccf). Moreover, the isolates strongly activated Toll-like receptor 2, which suggests lipopeptides as their active immunomodulatory structure. Thus, three novel bacterial strains with great potential as probiotic candidates and promising immunomodulatory properties have here been identified and characterized.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gross blood in stools is a peculiar entity in preterm infants, but little is known about its etiology. As gut microbiota can be distorted in preterm infants, we aimed to evaluate the gut microbiota in infants with gross blood in stools. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, controlled, single-center study, we enrolled all infants born before 34 weeks of gestational age presenting gross blood in stools that was either completely isolated or associated with mild clinical symptoms or radiological signs. Each case was paired with two controls who were hospitalized in the same unit and were matched for gestational age and birth weight. The diversity of the gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene PCR and temporal temperature gel electrophoresis. We calculated a diversity score corresponding to the number of operational taxonomic units present in the microbiota. RESULTS: Thirty-three preterm infants with gross blood in stools were matched with 57 controls. Clinical characteristics were similar in cases and controls. There was no statistically significant difference in the diversity score between the two groups, but microbiota composition differed. The proportion of infants with Escherichia coli was significantly higher in cases than in controls (p=0.045) and the opposite pattern occurred for Staphylococcus sp. (p=0.047). CONCLUSION: Dysbiosis could be a risk factor for gross blood in stools in preterm infants. Additional, larger studies are needed to confirm the implications of the presence of different genotypes of E. coli and to evaluate preventive actions such as the prophylactic use of probiotics and/or prebiotics.",

			"article_name": "Patterned progression of bacterial populations in the premature infant gut.",
			"abstract": "In the weeks after birth, the gut acquires a nascent microbiome, and starts its transition to bacterial population equilibrium. This early-in-life microbial population quite likely influences later-in-life host biology. However, we know little about the governance of community development: does the gut serve as a passive incubator where the first organisms randomly encountered gain entry and predominate, or is there an orderly progression of members joining the community of bacteria? We used fine interval enumeration of microbes in stools from multiple subjects to answer this question. We demonstrate via 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing of 922 specimens from 58 subjects that the gut microbiota of premature infants residing in a tightly controlled microbial environment progresses through a choreographed succession of bacterial classes from Bacilli to Gammaproteobacteria to Clostridia, interrupted by abrupt population changes. As infants approach 33-36 wk postconceptional age (corresponding to the third to the twelfth weeks of life depending on gestational age at birth), the gut is well colonized by anaerobes. Antibiotics, vaginal vs. Caesarian birth, diet, and age of the infants when sampled influence the pace, but not the sequence, of progression. Our results suggest that in infants in a microbiologically constrained ecosphere of a neonatal intensive care unit, gut bacterial communities have an overall nonrandom assembly that is punctuated by microbial population abruptions. The possibility that the pace of this assembly depends more on host biology (chiefly gestational age at birth) than identifiable exogenous factors warrants further consideration.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Estimates of population-based incidence for rotavirus inpatient and outpatient visits, as well as their associated medical costs, can provide valuable information to assess the potential benefits of rotavirus vaccination. METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for rotavirus gastroenteritis at 6 medical institutions for children younger than 5 years from July 2012 to June 2013 in Beijing Municipality and Gansu Province. We collected stool samples of diarrhea patients for testing rotavirus, and epidemiological, clinical and cost data. RESULTS: The proportion of rotavirus-positive for inpatient and outpatient visits from Beijing was 28.7% (138/481) and 19.4% (133/687); a statistically lower proportion than observed in Gansu among inpatient visits (45.2%, 245/542, P < 0.001) and among outpatient visits (28.8%, 66/229, P = 0.003), respectively. The G9P[8] genotype was most prevalent in Beijing (60.6%) and in Gansu (77.6%). The median Vesikari scale value was 16 for rotavirus inpatients and 15 for nonrotavirus inpatients. Population-based estimated rates of rotavirus-related hospitalizations were 14.4 (95% CI, 13-16) per 10,000 children, and the rate of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the outpatient setting was 149 (95% CI, 145-153) per 10,000 children younger than 5 years. The estimated total number of rotavirus-related inpatient visits were 3790 (95% CI, 2488-3827) cases and 29,101 (95% CI: 27,748-29,279) outpatient visits. The total cost of rotavirus infection was $1.4 million (95% CI, $0.9-1.4 million) for hospitalizations and $4.2 million (95% CI, $4.0-4.2 million) for outpatient visits per year in Beijing and Gansu. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children younger than 5 years worldwide,accounting for an estimated 25 million clinic visits, 2 million hospitalizations and 453,000 deaths each year. In China, the world's most populous nation, surveillance at sentinel hospitals showed that approximately 48% of AGE hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years were attributed to rotavirus from 2003 to 2007, and 13,387 rotavirus deaths were estimated in China in 2002 alone.The Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine, consisting of serotype G10P[12], was licensed in 2000 but is not included in the National Expanded Program of Immunization vaccine recommendations for Chinese children. License applications for new rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix, produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, and RotaTeq, produced by Merck and Company) have been submitted for administering these vaccines to Chinese infants [corrected].",

Results showed that all nine isolates belonged to the genus Lactobacillus. They were able to tolerate pH 3 for 3 h, 0.3% bile salts for 4 h, and 1.9 mg/mL pancreatic enzymes for 3 h. They exhibited good ability to attach to intestinal epithelial cells and were not resistant to the tested antibiotics. They also showed good antimicrobial activities against the tested pathogenic strains of humans, and most of them exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity than the reference strain L. casei Shirota. Thus, the nine Lactobacillus strains could be considered as potential antimicrobial probiotic strains against human pathogens and should be further studied for their human health benefits.",

Two hundred and fifty eligible neonates were randomized to study group (Antibiotic group-receiving first-line antibiotics for 3 days) and control group (No Antibiotic group). Both groups were evaluated clinically and by laboratory parameters (sepsis screen and blood cultures) for development of sepsis. All neonates were monitored for respiratory, neurological, and other systemic complications and received supportive treatment according to standard management protocol of the unit. One hundred and twenty one neonates were randomized to 'Antibiotic' group and 129 to 'No Antibiotic' group. The overall incidence of suspect sepsis was 9.6 % in the study population with no significant difference between 'No Antibiotic' and 'Antibiotic' groups (10.8 vs. 8.2 %, p = 0.48, odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.32-1.73). Incidence of culture-proven sepsis was also not significantly different between the two groups (5.42 vs. 4.13 %, p = 0.63, OR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.23-2.43). The incidence of mortality, meconium aspiration syndrome, and other complications was comparable amongst the two groups. CONCLUSION: Routine antibiotic prophylaxis in neonates born through MSAF did not reduce the incidence of sepsis in this study population. (Clinicaltrials.gov no. - NCT01290003).",

Infants were randomized to be fed formula supplemented with either 4 g (EF4) or 8 g (EF8) GOS/L or a CF until day of life (DOL) 119. Infants were to be seen at DOL 14, 35, 56, 84, and 119. Parents were to record detailed 24-hour information about intake, tolerance to feedings, and stool patterns and consistency each day from enrollment to DOL 35, and for 3 days before DOL 56, 84, and 119. Stool consistency was scored on a 5-point scale as watery (1), loose/mushy, soft, formed, or hard (5).

Thus, a statistically rigorous analytical framework to simultaneously examine both host and microbial responses to dietary/environmental factors using exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells was developed. Differential expression of  approximately 1200 genes, including genes regulating intestinal proliferation, differentiation and barrier function, was observed between BF and FF term infants. Canonical correlation analysis uncovered a relationship between microbiome virulence genes and host immunity and defense genes. Lastly, exfoliated cells from preterm and term infants were compared. Pathways associated with immune cell function and inflammation were up-regulated in preterm, whereas cell growth-related genes were up-regulated in the term infants. Thus, coordinate measurement of the transcriptomes of exfoliated epithelial cells and microbiome allows inquiry into mutualistic host-microbe interactions in the infant, which can be used to prospectively study gut development or, retrospectively, to identify potential triggers of disease in banked samples.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal infections are caused by a broad spectrum of pathogens. Conventional diagnostic procedures are resource and time consuming due to single pathogen testing, often in different laboratories. METHOD: We analyzed 312 consecutive stool samples from pediatric patients (n = 127) with gastroenteritis or from adult travelers returning from the tropics with suspected parasite infestation (n = 185) using commercial multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) (xTAG gastrointestinal pathogen panel, Luminex) covering 15 diarrhea-causing pathogens. The results of the positive samples and a representative number of negative samples were compared to standard methods, including NAT, direct antigen detection (DAD), bacterial culture and microscopy. RESULTS: Of the 185 samples from adult travelers, 21 (11 %) were multiplexNAT-positive, with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (4 %) being the predominant pathogen. Microscopic examination revealed Blastocystis hominis in 23 % not covered by the panel. MultiplexNAT scored positive in 66 pediatric samples (52 %), with rotavirus (27 %) being the most prevalent. All adenovirus-, rotavirus-, Clostridium difficile- and Cryptosporidium-positive samples were confirmed in external laboratories, but only 40 % of norovirus- and 29 % of Giardia-positive samples. Analysis of frozen specimens by bacterial culture showed the highest discrepancies with the multiplexNAT. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates broad detection of relevant gastroenteritis pathogens by multiplexNAT with a short turnaround time. This is important for diagnosis, infection control and empiric management of gastroenteritis patients, but may be selectively complemented by bacterial culture and resistance testing.",

There is an urgent need to better understand the contributions of novel, potentially uncultured, diarrheal pathogens to severe diarrheal disease, as well as distortions in normal gut microbiota composition that might facilitate severe disease. RESULTS: We use high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare fecal microbiota composition in children under five years of age who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD) with the microbiota from diarrhea-free controls. Our study includes 992 children from four low-income countries in West and East Africa, and Southeast Asia. Known pathogens, as well as bacteria currently not considered as important diarrhea-causing pathogens, are positively associated with MSD, and these include Escherichia/Shigella, and Granulicatella species, and Streptococcus mitis/pneumoniae groups. In both cases and controls, there tend to be distinct negative correlations between facultative anaerobic lineages and obligate anaerobic lineages. Overall genus-level microbiota composition exhibit a shift in controls from low to high levels of Prevotella and in MSD cases from high to low levels of Escherichia/Shigella in younger versus older children; however, there was significant variation among many genera by both site and age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the current understanding of microbiota-associated diarrhea pathogenicity in young children from developing countries. Our findings are necessarily based on correlative analyses and must be further validated through epidemiological and molecular techniques.",

Several in vitro studies suggest that LF could promote an environment in the gut of neonates that favors colonization with beneficial bacteria. However, clinical studies on the correlation between the concentration of LF in breast milk and feces of infants and the gut microbiota in infants are lacking. In our study we analyzed the content of LF and the microbiota of breast milk and feces of infants of 48 mother-infant pairs (34 full-term and 14 pre-term infants) at birth and 30 days after delivery. In the term group, a significant decrease of mean LF concentration between colostrum (7.0 +/- 5.1 mg/ml) and mature milk (2.3 +/- 0.4 mg/ml) was observed. In pre-term group, breast milk LF levels were similar to those observed in full-term group. Fecal LF concentration of healthy infants was extremely high both in term and pre-term infants, higher than the amount reported in healthy children and adults. In term infants mean fecal LF levels significantly increased from birth (994 +/- 1,828 mug/ml) to 1 month of age (3,052 +/- 4,323 mug/ml). The amount of LF in the feces of 30 day-old term infants was significantly associated with maternal mature milk LF concentration (p = 0.030) confirming that breast milk represents the main source of LF found in the gut of infants. A linear positive correlation between colostrum and mature milk LF concentration was observed (p = 0.008) indicating that milk LF levels reflect individual characteristics. In pre-term infants higher mean concentrations of fecal LF at birth (1,631 +/- 2,206 mug/ml) and 30 days after delivery (7,633 +/- 9,960 mug/ml) were observed in comparison to full-term infants. The amount of fecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli resulted associated with the concentration of fecal LF 3 days after delivery (p = 0.017 and p = 0.026, respectively). These results suggest that high levels of fecal LF in neonates, particularly in the first days of life, could represent an important factor in the initiation, development and/or composition of the neonatal gut microbiota. Since early host-microbe interaction is a crucial component of healthy immune and metabolic programming, high levels of fecal LF in neonates may beneficially contribute to the immunologic maturation and well-being of the newborn, especially in pre-term infants.",

			"abstract": "The state and development of the intestinal epithelium is vital for infant health, and increased understanding in this area has been limited by an inability to directly assess epithelial cell biology in the healthy newborn intestine. To that end, we have developed a novel, noninvasive, molecular approach that utilizes next generation RNA sequencing on stool samples containing intact epithelial cells for the purpose of quantifying intestinal gene expression. We then applied this technique to compare host gene expression in healthy term and extremely preterm infants. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate repeatable detection of human mRNA expression, and network analysis shows immune cell function and inflammation pathways to be up-regulated in preterm infants. This study provides incontrovertible evidence that whole-genome sequencing of stool-derived RNA can be used to examine the neonatal host epithelial transcriptome in infants, which opens up opportunities for sequential monitoring of gut gene expression in response to dietary or therapeutic interventions.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: We recently reported significant association of non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) with acute diarrhea in children. Persistent diarrhea (PD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants below two years of age in developing countries. Understanding age-dependent frequency and duration of NPEV infections is important to determine their association with persistent diarrhea and disease burden. OBJECTIVES: A cohort of 140 infants was followed for 6 months to 2 years of age to determine the frequency, duration, and association with PD of NPEV infections in comparison with rotavirus and other agents. STUDY DESIGN: Stool samples were collected every 14 days, and diarrheal episodes and their duration were recorded. Enteroviruses were characterized by RT-PCR and VP1 gene sequence analysis, rotavirus by electropherotyping, and other agents by PCR. RESULTS: Of 4545 samples, negative for oral polio vaccine strains, 3907 (85.96%) and 638 (14.04%) were NPEV-negative and NPEV-positive, respectively, representing 403 (8.87%) infection episodes. About 68% of NPEV infections occurred during the first year with every child having at least one episode lasting between four days and four months. Approximately 38% and 22% of total diarrheal episodes were positive for NPEV and RV, respectively. While about 18% of NPEV infection episodes were associated with diarrhea, 6% being persistent, 13% of total diarrheal episodes were persistent involving infections by monotype NPEV strains or sequential infections by multiple strains and other agents. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report revealing NPEVs as the single most frequently and persistently detected viral pathogen in every PD episode.",

			"abstract": "The role of bacteria in the causation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is gaining acceptance. Mainstream research favouring respiratory compromise has failed to provide a plausible pathogenetic mechanism despite many years of investigation and thousands of research papers. Bacterial colonisation of the colon of the human infant is influenced by many factors including age, mode of delivery, diet, environment, and antibiotic exposure. The gut microbiome influences development of the immune system. The gut microflora could be important in protection against the bacteria and/or their toxins purportedly involved in SIDS pathogenesis. The aim was to perform a preliminary investigation of the gut microflora in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with live comparison babies. The intestinal contents from 52 SIDS, and 102 faecal samples from age-matched live comparison infants were screened by PCR to target 16s RNA genes of Clostridium innocuum, Cl. Perfringens, Cl. difficile, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Staphylococcus aureus. Gut colonisation of the babies with these bacteria was analysed in relation to age, gender and type of feeding; and for SIDS babies sleeping position. Cl. difficile, Cl. innocuum and B. thetaiotaomicron were significantly associated with SIDS with 25%, 46% and 30% of cases PCR positive for these respective bacteria compared with only 6%, 23% and 8.8% respectively in the comparison group. SIDS babies had dual colonisation by both Cl. perfringens and Cl. difficile significantly more often than comparison babies and also with triple colonisation by Cl. perfringens, Cl. difficile and Cl. innocuum. SIDS babies were more often colonised by S. aureus than comparison babies. In addition, SIDS babies found prone were significantly more likely to be colonised by S. aureus than for other positions recorded (OR = infinity; CI = 2.04 - infinity). No significant differences between breast and bottle-fed SIDS babies was observed in regard to each clostridial bacterium, or S. aureus, however Cl. innocuum was found to be significantly associated with formula feeding in the comparison cohort. Comparison of breast and formula feeding of SIDS babies with live comparison babies revealed significant differences with regards to some of the clostridial bacteria. Age-specific differences in gut bacterial microbiome were observed in both SIDS and comparison healthy babies. This study gives an insight into differences in the gut bacterial microbiome of SIDS babies compared with healthy babies. These differences could be important in contributing to a baby's susceptibility to infection and therefore to SIDS. The association of S. aureus colonisation with prone sleep position supports the hypothesis that prone sleep position could increase the risk of ingestion/inhalation of bacteria contaminating the sleeping surface and could account for the increased risk of SIDS in babies who are put to sleep prone. The study provides impetus for broader studies into the gut microbiome of babies and could lead to effective approaches to SIDS prevention.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Category II fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings are considered indeterminate; thus, improved risk stratification of category II FHR tracings is needed. We estimated whether the presence of meconium increased the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This study was conducted within a prospective cohort of 5000 women with singleton pregnancies who were admitted in labor at term. Pregnancies with category II FHR in the 60 minutes before delivery were included. FHR data were extracted by trained nurses who were blinded to clinical outcome. The exposure was the presence of meconium. The primary outcome was a composite neonatal morbidity defined as >/=1 of the following: neonatal death, neurologic morbidity, respiratory morbidity, hypotension that required treatment, and sepsis. Secondary outcomes were nursery admission, cord pH, 5-minute Apgar score, and components of the composite. Logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 3257 women with category II FHR tracings, 693 women (21.3%) had meconium, and 2564 women (78.7%) did not. Meconium was associated with higher risk of the composite morbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-3.48) and increased risks of the secondary outcomes. The associations remained significant when infants with meconium aspiration syndrome were excluded. Thick meconium was associated significantly with the composite morbidity. CONCLUSION: The presence of meconium is associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidity in women with category II FHR pattern. This clinical factor may assist clinicians in managing category II FHR patterns in labor.",

Strain CU3-7(T) showed the highest level of sequence similarity with Bifidobacterium adolescentis KCTC 3216(T) (98.4 %), followed by Bifidobacterium ruminantium KCTC 3425(T) (97.9 %). Analysis of hsp60 sequences showed that strain CU3-7(T) was closely related to B. adolescentis KCTC 3216(T) (94.0 %) and B. ruminantium KCTC 3425(T) (92.5 %). The DNA-DNA hybridization values with the closely related strains were all below the cut-off value for species delineation, 17.0 % with B. ruminantium KCTC 3425(T) and 14.9 % with B. adolescentis KCTC 3216(T).

The DNA G+C content was 58.6 mol%. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomy, strain CU3-7(T) should be classified as the type strain of a novel species within the genus Bifidobacterium, for which the name Bifidobacterium faecale sp. nov. is proposed ( = KACC 17904(T) = JCM 19861(T)).",

The objective of this study was to review the results of meconium drug screening in multiple births to compare drug(s) and/or drug metabolite(s) detected. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from a national reference laboratory and an academic medical center. The data were de-identified for the reference laboratory dataset. For the academic center data, a detailed chart review of the newborn and mother's medical record was performed on cases for which one or more drug(s) and/or metabolites(s) were identified and confirmed in meconium. Meconium was analyzed for amphetamine, methamphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoid metabolites, cocaine metabolites, methadone, opiates, oxycodone, phencyclidine and propoxyphene. One hundred and forty-two of 1,084 sets of twins and 2 of 20 sets of triplets had mismatched results. The incidence of mismatched results among the individual drug or drug classes tested was 0.9% (208 of 23,848 total results). For the panel of drug testing performed, mismatches were seen in 13% (142 of 1,084) sets of twins and 10% (2 of 20) sets of triplets. Barbiturates (33%), opiates (30%) and benzodiazepines (28%) were the most common mismatches in the national reference laboratory dataset. Benzodiazepines (89%) and opiates (51%) were most common in the academic medical center dataset with most explained by iatrogenic medications administered to one infant but not the other. Mismatches for cannabinoids most often occurred when tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites were present at a low concentration (near lower reporting limit) in one infant but not the other. Mismatched results of meconium drug testing in multiples not explainable by differences in prescribed medications are uncommon and most often occur when an analyte is barely above reporting cutoff in only one infant. Administration of iatrogenic medications to one infant but not the other(s) is another frequent cause of such mismatches.",

			"abstract": "Non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) have often been identified in association with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in most polio surveillance studies worldwide. In a polio endemic country like Nigeria, there is need for distinction of AFP due to poliovirus and those potentially due to NPEVs. This study was undertaken to characterize the enterovirus (EV) types circulating in both children with and without AFP in Nigeria. Of fecal sample from 966 children with AFP, 96 (10%) were positive for NPEVs in RD cells, while 42 (5.5%) of 756 samples from non-AFP children was positive. Genotyping of all NPEV isolates was done by partial VP1 gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. EV-B was the predominant species detected (84%) and infection was common in children with AFP with CVB3, E6, and E11 constituting the predominant types detected. The CVB3 isolates cluster with Chinese CVB3 isolate recently detected in a newborn with AFP. There was also a remarkable clustering of isolates such as E6, E12, E13, E24, E30 and E33 to types previous detected in West Africa suggesting a probable circulation of these lineages in the region. Taken together, this study reveals a diverse species EV-B types in AFP cases and highlights the fact that other neurotropic EVs circulate in asymptomatic persons. Improved continuous surveillance of NPEV is warranted as in the likely attainment of polio eradication, other neurotropic EVs may emerge causing similar paralytic diseases.",

			"article_name": "Microbial succession in the gut: directional trends of taxonomic and functional change in a birth cohort of Spanish infants.",
			"abstract": "In spite of its major impact on life-long health, the process of microbial succession in the gut of infants remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze the patterns of taxonomic and functional change in the gut microbiota during the first year of life for a birth cohort of 13 infants. We detect that individual instances of gut colonization vary in the temporal dynamics of microbiota richness, diversity, and composition at both functional and taxonomic levels. Nevertheless, trends discernible in a majority of infants indicate that gut colonization occurs in two distinct phases of succession, separated by the introduction of solid foods to the diet. This change in resource availability causes a sharp decrease in the taxonomic richness of the microbiota due to the loss of rare taxa (p = 2.06e-9), although the number of core genera shared by all infants increases substantially. Moreover, although the gut microbial succession is not strictly deterministic, we detect an overarching directionality of change through time towards the taxonomic and functional composition of the maternal microbiota. Succession is however not complete by the one year mark, as significant differences remain between one-year-olds and their mothers in terms of taxonomic (p = 0.009) and functional (p = 0.004) microbiota composition, and in taxonomic richness (p = 2.76e-37) and diversity (p = 0.016). Our results also indicate that the taxonomic composition of the microbiota shapes its functional capacities. Therefore, the observed inter-individual variability in taxonomic composition during succession is not fully compensated by functional equivalence among bacterial genera and may have important physiological consequences. Finally, network analyses suggest that positive interactions among core genera during community assembly contribute to ensure their permanence within the gut, and highlight an expansion of complexity in the interactions network as the core of taxa shared by all infants grows following the introduction of solid foods.",

			"abstract": "Rotaviruses (RVs) are leading causes of severe diarrhea and vomiting in infants and young children. RVs with G10P[11] genotype specificity have been associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic neonatal infections in Vellore, India. To identify possible viral genetic determinants responsible for differences in symptomology, the genome sequences of G10P[11] RVs in stool samples of 19 neonates with symptomatic infections and 20 neonates with asymptomatic infections were determined by Sanger and next-generation sequencing. The data showed that all 39 viruses had identical genotype constellations (G10-P[11]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A1-N1-T1-E2-H3), the same as those of the previously characterized symptomatic N155 Vellore isolate. The data also showed that the RNA and deduced protein sequences of all the Vellore G10P[11] viruses were nearly identical; no nucleotide or amino acid differences were found that correlated with symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection. Next-generation sequencing data revealed that some stool samples, both from neonates with symptomatic infections and from neonates with asymptomatic infections, also contained one or more positive-strand RNA viruses (Aichi virus, astrovirus, or salivirus/klassevirus) suspected of being potential causes of pediatric gastroenteritis. However, none of the positive-strand RNA viruses could be causally associated with the development of symptoms. These results indicate that the diversity of clinical symptoms in Vellore neonates does not result from genetic differences among G10P[11] RVs; instead, other undefined factors appear to influence whether neonates develop gastrointestinal disease symptoms. IMPORTANCE: Rotavirus (RV) strains have been identified that preferentially replicate in neonates, in some cases, without causing gastrointestinal disease. Surveillance studies have established that G10P[11] RVs are a major cause of neonatal infection in Vellore, India, with half of infected neonates exhibiting symptoms. We used Sanger and next-generation sequencing technologies to contrast G10P[11] RVs recovered from symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates. Remarkably, the data showed that the RNA genomes of the viruses were virtually indistinguishable and lacked any differences that could explain the diversity of clinical outcomes among infected Vellore neonates. The sequencing results also indicated that some symptomatic and some asymptomatic Vellore neonates were infected with other enteric viruses (Aichi virus, astrovirus, salvirus/klassevirus); however, none could be correlated with the presence of symptoms in neonates. Together, our findings suggest that other poorly defined factors, not connected to the genetic makeup of the Vellore G10P[11] viruses, influence whether neonates develop gastrointestinal disease symptoms.",

A viral etiology is most common, and rotavirus and norovirus are reported to be the leading causative agents. There are still few epidemiological data on the simultaneous occurrence of these viruses in Morocco. The aim of this study was to provide useful epidemiological data on the gastroenteritis associated with rotavirus and norovirus among children aged less than 5 years. METHODS: From January to December 2011, 335 samples were tested for rotavirus and norovirus using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-multiplex PCR) and real-time RT-PCR. Partial sequences of the norovirus were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the genotype. RESULTS: The overall rates of rotavirus and norovirus infections were 26.6% and 16.1%, respectively. Mixed viral infections were detected in 9 of 335 stool specimens (2.7%).The most common genotype combination in the rotavirus strains was G1[P8] (51.7%), followed by G2[P4] (10.1%), G2[P8] (4.5%), G9[P8] (3.4%), G4[P8] (3.4%), and G1[P6] (2.3%). Among patients positive for norovirus, 42 (77.8%) tested positive for GII and 12 (22.2%) for GI. Thirty-three (78.6%) of the norovirus GII-positive cases were successfully characterized. Genotype GII.4 was the most prevalent (n = 27; 81.8%), followed by GII.3 (n = 2; 6.1%), GII.13 (n = 2; 6.1%), GII.16 (n = 1; 3%), and GII.17 (n = 1; 3%). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in Morocco, norovirus is the most frequent cause of acute gastroenteritis after rotavirus, but further enteric viruses need to be integrated in the surveillance system so that a conclusion could be drawn.",

RESULTS: We found that NV, SV and RV infections altogether accounted for 45% of cases of GE. Notably, NV was found in 24% (79/330) of the children, followed by SV (17%, 57/330) and RV (8%, 25/330).

This study evaluated the effects of a term infant formula containing high sn-2 palmitate term infant formula (sn-2) or an identical formula supplemented with oligofructose (OF) at 2 concentrations (sn-2+3 g/L OF, sn-2+5 g/L OF) on stool composition, stool characteristics, and fecal bifidobacteria. METHODS: Healthy, term formula-fed infants 7 to 14 days old (n = 300) were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive standard formula (control), sn-2, sn-2+3 g/L OF, or sn-2+5 g/L OF for 8 weeks. Human milk (HM)-fed infants (n = 75) were studied in parallel. Stool samples were collected from all subjects at week 8 for fatty acid soaps and mineral content, and from a subset at baseline and week 8 for bifidobacteria. Stool characteristics were assessed via 3-day diary. RESULTS: The sn-2 group had 46% less stool soap palmitate (P < 0.001) and softer stools than control (20% more mushy soft stools, P = 0.026; 50% fewer formed stools, P = 0.003). Addition of OF resulted in even fewer formed stools versus control (65% fewer for sn-2+3 g/L OF, 79% fewer for sn-2+5 g/L OF), with 5 g/L OF more closely resembling that of HM-fed infants. Both sn-2 (P < 0.05) and sn-2 with OF groups (P < 0.01) had significantly higher fecal bifidobacteria concentrations than control at week 8, not differing from HM-fed infants. CONCLUSIONS: High sn-2-palmitate formulas led to reduced stool soaps, softer stools, and increased bifidobacteria, whereas addition of OF further improved stool consistency. Those modifications brought outcomes in formula-fed infants closer to that in HM-fed infants.",

			"abstract": "Meconium is the earliest stool of newborns, and is a complex matrix that reflects the degree of exposure of the fetus to xenobiotics. To investigate fetal exposure to volatile organic compounds, an analytical method was developed to identify and quantify BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o,m,p-xylene) and two chlorinated solvents (trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene) in meconium. Headspace-solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was selected because it is simple, sensitive, can be automated, and requires no extensive sample preparation. Several extraction variables were optimized (fiber type, incubation time, temperature of fiber, and use of salt). Because meconium is a complex matrix, quantification by SPME was considered carefully because of potential interference, for example competitive adsorption. Calibration in water was compared with calibration in meconium using external and internal methods (with isotope-labeled compounds). In meconium, limits of quantification were determined to be in the range 0.064-0.096 ng g(-1) for the investigated compounds. All target compounds were determined in \"real-case\" meconium samples.",

			"abstract": "It is important to evaluate the impact of pesticides on human health because exposure to these compounds has been linked to harmful effects in many research studies. This exposure may be particularly harmful during the early stages of development (e.g. the prenatal period). The aim of the present study was to develop an analytical strategy for quantifying a number of pesticides and their metabolites in meconium (the neonate's first faeces), in order to characterize the extent of foetal exposure. The meconium sample was dried and grinded in order to homogenize the sample, prior to solid-liquid extraction and a purification by solid-phase extraction using a weak anion mixed-mode polymeric sorbent. Analyte separation and quantification was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Five pesticide families (carbamates, organophosphates, pyrethroids, phenylureas and phenoxy herbicides) and their metabolites could be quantified in meconium with limits of quantification ranging between 0.2 ng/g and 200 ng/g. This method was applied to a set of 171 meconium samples collected in the Picardie region of northern France. The highest prevalence was observed for metabolites of organophosphates and carbamates (57.9% and 22.8%, respectively). The parent pesticides were rarely present and were only found at very low concentrations, except for the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and cypermethrin, which were found in 7.6% of meconium samples at concentrations of between 43.8 and 480 ng/g. The most frequently detected contaminant was the organophosphate metabolite dimethyl thiophosphate detected in 49.1% of the samples and quantified with a median concentration of 344 ng/g. These data evidence significant foetal exposure to organophosphate pesticides, pyrethroids and carbamates.",

			"abstract": "Molecular methods such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are rapidly replacing traditional tests to detect fecal viral pathogens in childhood diarrhea. This technique has now increased the analytical sensitivity so drastically that positive results are found in asymptomatic children, leading to complex interpretation of real-time PCR results and difficult distinction between asymptomatic shedding and etiological cause of disease. We performed a review of the literature including pediatric studies using real-time PCR and a minimal inclusion period of one year to exclude bias by seasonality. We searched for studies on rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, and sapovirus, known to be the most common viruses to cause gastroenteritis in the pediatric population. For these viruses, we summarized the detection rates in hospitalized and community-based children with clinical symptoms of gastroenteritis, as well as subjects with asymptomatic viral shedding. Moreover, insight is given into the different viral sero- and genotypes causing pediatric gastroenteritis. We also discuss the scoring systems for severity of disease and their clinical value. A few published proposals have been made to improve the clinical interpretation of real-time PCR results, which we recapitulate and discuss in this review. We propose using the semi-quantitative measure of real-time PCR, as a surrogate for viral load, in relation to the severity score to distinguish asymptomatic viral shedding from clinically relevant disease. Overall, this review provides a better understanding of the scope of childhood gastroenteritis, discusses a method to enhance the interpretation of real-time PCR results, and proposes conditions for future research to enhance clinical implementation.",

METHODS: Subjects were 24 0/7-31 6/7 wk of gestational age who received >/= 50% breast milk and a total of >/= 100 ml/kg of feeds by 10 d. Rectal (fecal) swabs were collected at 10 and 30 d and analyzed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. At both time points, we examined the rectal microbiome from infants who received only 2 d of antibiotics and those who received at least 7 d of antibiotics. RESULTS: In the 29 infants enrolled in our study, we found a decrease in diversity index from 10 d samples in those who received more antibiotics. Such difference in diversity and richness was not as pronounced in 30 d samples. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were most abundant in the 10 d samples. While these two phyla remained dominant in 30 d samples, there was an increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.

In adults, particularly amongst the elderly, it can lead to outbreaks at a time when demands on clinical services are at their peak. AIM: To evaluate seasonal screening of young children and elderly patients with suspected viral gastroenteritis using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for enteric viruses within a general hospital setting. METHODS: Stool samples from 200 children aged five years and under were screened for rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus and norovirus using multiplex PCR and a combined rotavirus/adenovirus immunochromatographic test (ICT) during the winter of 2012. Diarrhoeal samples submitted to the laboratory from 195 adults aged 65 years and over attending as inpatients were also evaluated by multiplex PCR. FINDINGS: One or more enteric viruses were detected by PCR in 56% of children. Rotavirus was the most prevalent virus, found in 19% of samples. Enteric (diarrhoea-associated) adenovirus was detected in 5% of samples and non-enteric adenovirus was detected in 14% of samples. Astrovirus, norovirus and sapovirus were detected in 18%, 12% and 10% of samples, respectively. The ICT yielded a slightly lower rate for rotavirus and enteric adenovirus, but gave more rapid results. Norovirus, rotavirus and adenovirus were detected in 15%, 2.5% and 1% of elderly adults attending hospital as inpatients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid screening of young children (for rotavirus, adenovirus and norovirus) and symptomatic, elderly adults (for norovirus) during winter months may help to limit nosocomial spread.",

A cross-sectional study was undertaken of hospitalised children <15 years of age in two hospitals investigated for healthcare-associated diarrhoea between November 2011 and June 2012. Stool specimens were analysed for the presence of C. difficile using a two-step testing algorithm including polymerase chain reaction (PCR). C. difficile was cultured and PCR ribotyping performed. Demographic data, illness characteristics and risk factors were compared between children with and without CDI. Non-duplicate stool specimens were collected from 320 children with a median age of 1.2 years (range 3 days to 15 years). Forty-six patients (14 %) tested met the definition for CDI. The overall incidence of CDI was 2.0 per 10,000 bed days. The percentage of positive tests among neonates was only 2.6 %. PCR ribotyping showed a range of strains, with ribotype 014 being the most common. Significant risk factors for CDI were treatment with proton pump inhibitors [risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.09-5.59; p = 0.002], presence of underlying malignancy (RR 2.71, 95 % CI 1.65-4.62; p = 0.001), receiving chemotherapy (RR 2.70, 95 % CI 1.41-4.83; p = 0.003) and exposure to antibiotics (RR 1.17, 95 % CI 0.99-1.17; p = 0.03). C. difficile is an important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhoea in this paediatric population. The notion that neonatal populations will always have high rates of colonisation with C. difficile may not be correct.

We correlated self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy and patient characteristics with objective alcohol indicators measured in fetal meconium. METHODS: A total of 557 women singleton births and available psychological tests, obstetric data and meconium samples were included in statistical analysis. Alcohol metabolites (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG)), were determined from meconium and correlated with patient characteristics. RESULTS: We found that 21.2% of the 557 participants admitted low-to-moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Of the parameters analyzed from meconium, only EtG showed an association with alcohol history (P < 0.01). This association was inverse in cases with EtG value above 120 ng/g. These values indicate women with most severe alcohol consumption, who obviously denied having consumed alcohol during pregnancy. No other associations between socioeconomic or psychological characteristics and the drinking status (via meconium alcohol metabolites) could be found. CONCLUSION: Women who drink higher doses of ethanol during pregnancy, according to metabolite measures in meconium, might be less likely to admit alcohol consumption.

			"abstract": "Use of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) for monitoring beach water quality is based on their co-occurrence with human pathogens, a relationship that can be dramatically altered by fate and transport processes after leaving the human intestine. We conducted a prospective cohort study at Avalon Beach, California (USA), where the indicator relationship is potentially affected by the discharge of sewage-contaminated groundwater and by solar radiation levels at this shallow, relatively quiescent beach. The goals of this study were to determine: 1) if swimmers exposed to marine water were at higher risk of illness than non-swimmers; 2) if FIB measured in marine water were associated with swimmer illness, and; 3) if the associations between FIB and swimmer health were modified by either submarine groundwater discharge or solar radiation levels. There were 7317 individuals recruited during the summers of 2007-08, 6165 (84%) of whom completed follow-up within two weeks of the beach visit. A total of 703 water quality samples were collected across multiple sites and time periods during recruitment days and analyzed for FIB using both culture-based and molecular methods. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) indicated that swimmers who swallowed water were more likely to experience Gastrointestinal Illness (GI Illness) within three days of their beach visit than non-swimmers, and that this risk was significantly elevated when either submarine groundwater discharge was high (AOR [95% CI]:2.18 [1.22-3.89]) or solar radiation was low (2.45 [1.25-4.79]). The risk of GI Illness was not significantly elevated for swimmers who swallowed water when groundwater discharge was low or solar radiation was high. Associations between GI Illness incidence and FIB levels (Enterococcus EPA Method 1600) among swimmers who swallowed water were not significant when we did not account for groundwater discharge, but were strongly associated when groundwater discharge was high (1.85 [1.06, 3.23]) compared to when it was low (0.77 [0.42, 1.42]; test of interaction: P = 0.03). These results demonstrate the need to account for local environmental conditions when monitoring for, and making decisions about, public health at recreational beaches.

Next generation molecular sequencing methodologies in tandem with modeling complex communities allow insights into the role of the microbiome in health and disease states. Infection-related disease states in which dysbiosis is integral include late-onset sepsis (LOS) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which still cause deaths and morbidity. Understanding microbiomic interactions may lead to alternative prevention, monitoring or treatment strategies, and modulation of long-term health outcomes especially in the preterm population. Recent studies have advanced understanding of the microbiome in NEC and LOS. RECENT FINDINGS: Mechanisms of host-microbiome interaction have been demonstrated. Patterns of microbiomic change in association with NEC and LOS have been observed, with community changes dominated by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes appearing to precede NEC, and very early microbiomic signatures influencing LOS. Data on viral and fungal elements are emerging. SUMMARY: Greater understanding of the neonatal bowel microbiome may allow tailored clinical practice and therapeutic intervention.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal self-reports, used for the detection of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), may lack validity, necessitating the use of an objective biomarker. The detection of fatty acid ethyl esters (products of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism) in meconium has been established as a novel biomarker of PAE. The purpose of the current study was to compare the prevalence of PAE as reported via maternal self-reports with the results of meconium testing, and to quantify the disparity between these two methods. METHODS: A systematic literature search for studies reporting on the prevalence of PAE, using maternal self-reports in combination with meconium testing, was conducted using multiple electronic bibliographic databases. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated based on eight studies, using the Mantel-Haenszel method, assuming a random effects model. A random effects meta-regression was performed to test for a difference. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of PAE as measured by meconium testing was 4.26 (95% CI: 1.34-13.57) times the pooled prevalence of PAE as measured by maternal self-reports. Large variations across the studies in regard to the difference between estimates obtained from maternal self-reports and those obtained from meconium testing were observed. CONCLUSIONS: If maternal self-reports are the sole information source upon which health care professionals rely, a number of infants who were prenatally exposed to alcohol are not being recognized as such. However, further research is needed in order to validate existing biomarkers, as well as discover new biomarkers, for the detection of PAE.",

METHODS: We examined prospectively collected stools from premature infants with sepsis to find pathogens that subsequently invaded their bloodstreams, and sought the same organisms in stools of infants without sepsis. Culture-based techniques were used to isolate stool bacteria that provisionally matched the bloodstream organisms, which were then genome sequenced to confirm or refute commonality. RESULTS: Of 11 children with late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections, 7 produced at least 1 stool that contained group B Streptococcus (GBS), Serratia marcescens, or Escherichia coli before their sepsis episode with provisionally matching organisms. Of 96 overlap comparison subjects without sepsis temporally associated with these cases, 4 were colonized with provisionally matching GBS or S. marcescens. Of 175 comparisons of stools from randomly selected infants without sepsis, 1 contained a GBS (this infant had also served as an overlap comparison subject and both specimens contained provisionally matching GBS). Genome sequencing confirmed common origin of provisionally matching fecal and blood isolates. The invasive E. coli were present in all presepticemic stools since birth, but gut colonization with GBS and S. marcescens occurred closer to time of bloodstream infection. CONCLUSIONS: The neonatal gut harbors sepsis-causing pathogens, but such organisms are not inevitable members of the normal microbiota. Surveillance microbiology, decolonization, and augmented hygiene might prevent dissemination of invasive bacteria between and within premature infants.",

			"article_name": "Early life establishment of site-specific microbial communities in the gut.",
			"abstract": "Fecal sampling is widely utilized to define small intestinal tissue-level microbial communities in healthy and diseased newborns. However, this approach may lead to inaccurate assessments of disease or therapeutics in newborns because of the assumption that the taxa in the fecal microbiota are representative of the taxa present throughout the gastrointestinal tract. To assess the stratification of microbes in the newborn gut and to evaluate the probable shortcoming of fecal sampling in place of tissue sampling, we simultaneously compared intestinal mucosa and fecal microbial communities in 15 neonates undergoing intestinal resections. We report three key results. First, when the site of fecal and mucosal samples are further apart, their microbial communities are more distinct, as indicated by low mean Sorensen similarity indices for each patient's fecal and tissue microbiota. Second, two distinct niches (intestinal mucosa and fecal microbiota) are evident by principal component analyses, demonstrating the critical role of sample source in defining microbial composition. Finally, in contrast to adult studies, intestinal bacterial diversity was higher in tissue than in fecal samples. This study represents an unprecedented map of the infant microbiota from intestinal mucosa and establishes discernable biogeography throughout the neonatal gastrointestinal tract. Our results question the reliance on fecal microbiota as a proxy for the developing intestinal microbiota. Additionally, the robust intestinal tissue-level bacterial diversity we detected at these early ages may contribute to the maturation of mucosal immunity.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is a major cause of severe diarrhea worldwide. It causes 453,000 deaths in children annually. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, sentinel site surveillance of rotavirus gastroenteritis started in 2009 and aimed to document burden of rotavirus diarrhea and identify circulating rotavirus genotypes. METHODS: Between August 2009 to June 2012, stool samples were collected in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, from children <5 years of age who met the WHO case definition for rotavirus gastroenteritis. Rotavirus antigen detection was performed using an enzyme immunoassay technique and rotavirus strains were characterized using a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: During the study period, 1614 stool samples were screened for rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay and 990 (61%) were positive. Of these, the genotype was determined in 330 (33%) samples. The most common genotypes found in the samples analyzed were G1P[8] in 2009 (28%) and 2012 (33%), G2P[4] (33%) in 2010 and G2P[6] (28%) in 2011. Uncommon strains like G8P[6] (5%), G6P[6] (5%), G12P[6] (3%), G12P[8] (3%) and G8P[8] (2%) were also detected. CONCLUSIONS: In Democratic Republic of the Congo, 61% of the diarrhea in children in <5 years of age was caused by rotavirus infection and a variety of rotavirus genotypes were detected. Implementation of rotavirus genotyping at the national level has improved the timely identification of rotavirus strains. These results will help decision makers in Democratic Republic of the Congo plan the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program.",

			"article_name": "Meconium microbiome analysis identifies bacteria correlated with premature birth.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the second leading cause of death in children under the age of five years worldwide, but the etiology of many cases remains enigmatic. The dogma that the fetus resides in a sterile environment is being challenged by recent findings and the question has arisen whether microbes that colonize the fetus may be related to preterm birth. It has been posited that meconium reflects the in-utero microbial environment. In this study, correlations between fetal intestinal bacteria from meconium and gestational age were examined in order to suggest underlying mechanisms that may contribute to preterm birth. METHODS: Meconium from 52 infants ranging in gestational age from 23 to 41 weeks was collected, the DNA extracted, and 16S rRNA analysis performed. Resulting taxa of microbes were correlated to clinical variables and also compared to previous studies of amniotic fluid and other human microbiome niches. FINDINGS: Increased detection of bacterial 16S rRNA in meconium of infants of <33 weeks gestational age was observed. Approximately 61.1% of reads sequenced were classified to genera that have been reported in amniotic fluid. Gestational age had the largest influence on microbial community structure (R = 0.161; p = 0.029), while mode of delivery (C-section versus vaginal delivery) had an effect as well (R = 0.100; p = 0.044). Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Photorhabdus, and Tannerella, were negatively correlated with gestational age and have been reported to incite inflammatory responses, suggesting a causative role in premature birth. INTERPRETATION: This provides the first evidence to support the hypothesis that the fetal intestinal microbiome derived from swallowed amniotic fluid may be involved in the inflammatory response that leads to premature birth.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) measurement in neonatal meconium has emerged as a reliable marker to objectively assess prenatal exposure to maternal ethanol complementary to fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEEs) measurement. The detection of EtG in meconium is currently a lengthy, difficult and expensive process using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as the analytical procedure. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the identification of EtG in meconium was developed, validated and applied to authentic meconium specimens from newborns collected in Europe. METHODS: The ELISA procedure was calibrated using 0.45, 0.9, 1.35 and 1.8 nmol/g (100, 200 300 and 400 ng/g) standards. Meconium (0.25 g) was mixed thoroughly, with extraction buffer (pH 7.3; 0.5 mL). The tube was capped, sonicated, centrifuged and the supernatant was decanted. An aliquot of the extract (50 muL) was placed in the well of the microplate followed by enzyme conjugate (150 muL). The plate was incubated for 1 h, washed with deionized water, dried and substrate (200 muL) was added. After 30 min incubation, stop solution was added and the plate was read at 450 nm and 650 nm. Samples were also analyzed for EtG and FAEEs by validated LC-MS/MS assays. RESULTS: Using an EtG cut-off of 0.9 nmol/g for both ELISA screening test and confirmatory LC-MS/MS, immunoassay sensitivity was 100%; specificity 78%; positive-predictive value (PPV) 29% and negative-predictive value (NPV) 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The assay is proposed as a preliminary screening test for the meconium of newborns suspected of being born to mothers drinking alcohol during pregnancy.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of biomarkers to detect severe NEC. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The time point of surgery in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is critical. Therefore, there is a need for markers that detect severe NEC, because clinical signs of severe NEC often develop late. This study evaluated the value of biomarkers reflecting intestinal cell damage and inflammation to detect severe NEC. METHODS: 29 neonates with NEC were included. Two definitions of moderate versus severe NEC were analyzed: medical NEC (n = 12) versus surgical or fatal NEC (n = 17); and Bell stage II NEC (n = 13) versus stage III NEC (n = 16). Urinary intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), serum amyloid A (SAA), C3a and C5a, and fecal calprotectin were measured. C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count data were measured in blood. RESULTS: In both definitions of moderate versus severe NEC, urinary SAA levels were significantly higher in severe NEC. A cut-off value of 34.4 ng/ml was found in surgical NEC versus medical NEC (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 83%; LR+, 4.88 (95% CI, 1.37-17.0); LR-, 0.20 (95% CI, 0.07-0.60)) at diagnosis of NEC and at one day prior to surgery in neonates who were operated later on. Combination of urinary SAA and platelet count increased the accuracy, with a sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 83%; LR+, 5.53 (95% CI, 1.57-20.0); and LR-, 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01-0.48). CONCLUSION: Urinary SAA is an accurate marker in differentiating severe NEC from moderate NEC; particularly if combined with serum platelet count.",

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that early fat supplement and FO increases post-resection protein absorption, intestinal RNA, protein without decreasing intestinal arachidonic acid (AA) in premature infants with an enterostomy. METHODS: 36 premature infants (<2 months old) with an enterostomy after surgical treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation who tolerated enteral feeding at 20 ml/kg/day were randomized to usual care (control, n = 18) or early supplementing enteral Microlipid (ML) and FO (treatment, n = 18). Intralipid was decreased as the dose of enteral fat was increased. Daily weight, ostomy output and nutritional intake were recorded. Weekly 24-hour ostomy effluent was collected to measure fecal protein. Protein absorption was calculated by subtracting fecal protein from dietary protein. Tissue samples from the functional stoma and the nonfunctional distal diverted end were collected during bowel reanastomosis to measure RNA, protein, and fatty acid (FA) profile. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the treatment group had higher protein absorption (g/kg/day) and intestinal RNA and protein (mug/mg tissue) proximal to the ostomy. The two groups had similar FA profiles except that the treatment group had higher n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, mug/mg tissue) proximal to the ostomy. CONCLUSION: Early supplementation of enteral ML and FO to premature infants with an enterostomy increased dietary protein absorption, intestinal RNA, protein and n-3 EPA content without altering other FA content.",

Independent quality assessment is important before introducing routine probiotic supplementation in this cohort. AIM: To assess product quality, and confirm that Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve) M-16V supplementation will increase fecal B. breve counts without adverse effects. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: Strain identity (16S rRNA gene sequencing), viability over 2 year shelf-life were confirmed, and microbial contamination of the product was ruled out. In a controlled trial preterm neonates (Gestation <33 weeks) ready to commence or on feeds for <12 hours were randomly allocated to either B. breve M-16V (3x109 cfu/day) or placebo (dextrin) supplementation until the corrected age 37 weeks. Stool samples were collected before (S1) and after 3 weeks of supplementation (S2) for studying fecal B. breve levels using quantitative PCR (Primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included total fecal bifidobacteria and NEC>/=Stage II. Categorical and continuous outcomes were analysed using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests, and McNemar and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 159 neonates (Probiotic: 79, Placebo: 80) were enrolled. Maternal and neonatal demographic characteristics were comparable between the groups. The proportion of neonates with detectable B. breve increased significantly post intervention: Placebo: [S1:2/66 (3%), S2: 25/66 (38%), p<0.001] Probiotic: [S1: 29/74 (40%), S2: 67/74 (91%), p<0.001]. Median S1 B. breve counts in both groups were below detection (<4.7 log cells x g(-1)), increasing significantly in S2 for the probiotic group (log 8.6) while remaining <4.7 log in the control group (p<0.001). There were no adverse effects including probiotic sepsis and no deaths. NEC>/=Stage II occurred in only 1 neonate (placebo group).

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infect more than 2 billion humans worldwide, causing significant morbidity in children. There are few data on the epidemiology and risk factors for infection in pre-school children. To investigate risk factors for infection in early childhood, we analysed data prospectively collected in the ECUAVIDA birth cohort in Ecuador. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Children were recruited at birth and followed up to 3 years of age with periodic collection of stool samples that were examined microscopically for STH parasites. Data on social, demographic, and environmental risk factors were collected from the mother at time of enrollment. Associations between exposures and detection of STH infections were analysed by multivariable logistic regression. Data were analysed from 1,697 children for whom a stool sample was obtained at 3 years. 42.3% had at least one STH infection in the first 3 years of life and the most common infections were caused by A. lumbricoides (33.2% of children) and T. trichiura (21.2%). Hookworm infection was detected in 0.9% of children. Risk of STH infection was associated with factors indicative of poverty in our study population such as Afro-Ecuadorian ethnicity and low maternal educational level. Maternal STH infections during pregnancy were strong risk factors for any childhood STH infection, infections with either A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura, and early age of first STH infection. Children of mothers with moderate to high infections intensities with A. lumbricoides were most at risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show high rates of infection with STH parasites during the first 3 years of life in an Ecuadorian birth cohort, an observation that was strongly associated with maternal STH infections during pregnancy. The targeted treatment of women of childbearing age, in particular before pregnancy, with anthelmintic drugs could offer a novel approach to the prevention of STH infections in pre-school children.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: An estimated 2.5 billion people worldwide lack access to improved sanitation facilities. While large-scale programs in some countries have increased latrine coverage, they sometimes fail to ensure optimal latrine use, including the safe disposal of child feces, a significant source of exposure to fecal pathogens. We undertook a cross-sectional study to explore fecal disposal practices among children in rural Orissa, India in villages where the Government of India's Total Sanitation Campaign had been implemented at least three years prior to the study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted surveys with heads of 136 households with 145 children under 5 years of age in 20 villages. We describe defecation and feces disposal practices and explore associations between safe disposal and risk factors. Respondents reported that children commonly defecated on the ground, either inside the household (57.5%) for pre-ambulatory children or around the compound (55.2%) for ambulatory children. Twenty percent of pre-ambulatory children used potties and nappies; the same percentage of ambulatory children defecated in a latrine. While 78.6% of study children came from 106 households with a latrine, less than a quarter (22.8%) reported using them for disposal of child feces. Most child feces were deposited with other household waste, both for pre-ambulatory (67.5%) and ambulatory (58.1%) children. After restricting the analysis to households owning a latrine, the use of a nappy or potty was associated with safe disposal of feces (OR 6.72, 95%CI 1.02-44.38) though due to small sample size the regression could not adjust for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In the area surveyed, the Total Sanitation Campaign has not led to high levels of safe disposal of child feces. Further research is needed to identify the actual scope of this potential gap in programming, the health risk presented and interventions to minimize any adverse effect.",

			"abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea among young children in developing countries. ETEC vaccines offer promise in reducing the burden of ETEC disease, but the development of these vaccines relies on the characterization of ETEC isolates from a variety of settings. To best reflect the full spectrum of ETEC disease in Leon, Nicaragua, the aim of this study was to characterize ETEC strains isolated from children with diarrhoea attending different settings (hospital, primary care clinics and in the community) and children from different age groups. We characterized ETEC isolates in terms of their colonization factors (CFs) and enterotoxins, and determined whether these factors varied with setting and age group. Diarrhoeal stool samples were obtained from children under the age of 60 months from: (1) the regional public hospital, (2) four public primary care clinics, and (3) a population-based cohort. In total, 58 ETEC-positive isolates were analysed by multiplex-PCR assays for the identification of CFs (CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, CS5, CS6, CS7, CS8, CS12, CS13, CS14, CS15, CS17, CS18, CS19, CS20, CS21, CS22 and CFA/I), and enterotoxins [heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable variants STh and STp]. The frequency of CFs and enterotoxins was compared among the three settings and for different age groups, using Fisher's exact test or a chi(2) test. At least one CF was detected among one-half of samples; CS19 was detected among all strains in which a CF was identified, either alone or in combination with another CF. Among all CFs detected, 91.7 % were identified as members of the class 5 fimbrial family. CFs were detected more commonly among samples from infants captured in the health facility setting compared with the community setting. Overall, LT was detected among 67.2 % of samples, STh was detected among 20.7 % and both enterotoxins were detected among 12.1 %. The enterotoxin STh was detected more commonly among cases in the community, whilst a combination of STh and LT was detected more commonly among cases treated in health facilities. Our results suggest that, to protect against diarrhoeal cases associated with this E. coli pathotype in Leon, Nicaragua, an ETEC vaccine that effectively targets the archeotype CFA/I of the class 5 fimbrial family would be the most effective in this setting.",

This study describes the epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter diarrheal infections in two facility-based surveillance sites in Guatemala. METHODS: Clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory data were collected on patients presenting with acute diarrhea from select healthcare facilities in the departments of Santa Rosa and Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, from January 2008 through August 2012. Stool specimens were cultured for Campylobacter and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on a subset of isolates. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to >/=3 antimicrobial classes. RESULTS: Campylobacter was isolated from 306 (6.0%) of 5137 stool specimens collected. For children <5 years of age, annual incidence was as high as 1288.8 per 100,000 children in Santa Rosa and 185.5 per 100,000 children in Quetzaltenango. Among 224 ambulatory care patients with Campylobacter, 169 (75.5%) received metronidazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 152 (66.7%) received or were prescribed oral rehydration therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were tested in 96 isolates; 57 (59.4%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 12 (12.5%) were MDR. CONCLUSION: Campylobacter was a major cause of diarrhea in children in two departments in Guatemala; antimicrobial resistance was high, and treatment regimens in the ambulatory setting which included metronidazole and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and lacked oral rehydration were sub-optimal.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of the surgical management for meconium ileus (MI) and Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS) in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Children born between 1990 and 2010 were identified using a regional CF database. Retrospective case note analysis was performed. Outcome measures for MI were mortality, relaparotomy rate, length of stay (LOS), time on parental nutrition (TP), and time to full feeds (TFF). Outcome measures for DIOS were: age of onset, number of episodes, and need for laparotomy. RESULTS: Seventy-five of 376 neonates presented with MI. Fifty-four (92%) required laparotomy. Contrast enema decompression was attempted in nineteen. There were no post-operative deaths. Thirty-nine (72%) neonates with MI were managed with stomas. LOS was longer in those managed with stomas (p=0.001) and in complex MI (p=0.002). Thirty-five patients were treated for DIOS. Twenty-five patients were managed with gastrograffin. Ten patients underwent surgical management of DIOS. Overall, MI did not predispose to later development of DIOS. There was a significantly greater incidence of laparotomy for DIOS in children who had MI. CONCLUSION: The proportion of neonates with complex meconium ileus was high (49%) and may explain the infrequent utilisation of radiological decompression. Complex MI or management with stomas both significantly increase LOS. Re-laparotomy rate is high (22%) in MI irrespective of the type of management. DIOS is not a benign condition, particularly when the child has had previous abdominal surgery. Early referral to a surgical team is essential in these children.",

To expand knowledge on HAdV-D in Sub-Saharan Africa, we investigated the prevalence, epidemiology and pathogenic potential of HAdV-D in humans from rural areas of 4 Sub-Saharan countries, Cote d'Ivoire (CI), Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central African Republic (CAR) and Uganda (UG). METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 287 people living in rural regions in CI, DRC, CAR and UG. HAdV-D prevalence and diversity were determined by PCR and sequencing. A gene block, spanning the genes pV to hexon, was used for analysis of genetic distance. Correlation between adenovirus infection and disease symptoms, prevalence differences, and the effect of age and gender on infection status were analyzed with cross tables and logistic regression models. RESULTS: The prevalence of HAdV-D in the investigated sites was estimated to be 66% in CI, 48% in DRC, 28% in CAR (adults only) and 65% in UG (adults only). Younger individuals were more frequently infected than adults; there was no difference in HAdV-D occurrence between genders. No correlation could be found between HAdV-D infection and clinical symptoms. Highly diverse HAdV-D sequences were identified, among which a number are likely to stand for novel types. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-D was detected with a high prevalence in study populations of 4 Sub-Saharan countries. The genetic diversity of the virus was high and further investigations are needed to pinpoint pathological potential of each of the viruses. High diversity may also favor the emergence of recombinants with altered tropism and pathogenic properties.",

			"abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) has consistently been the predominant bacterial cause of diarrhea in many birth cohort- and hospital-based studies conducted in Egypt. We evaluated the pathogenicity of ETEC isolates in a birth cohort of children living in a rural community in Egypt. Between 2004 and 2007, we enrolled and followed 348 children starting at birth until their second year of life. A stool sample and two rectal swabs were collected from children during twice-weekly visits when they presented with diarrhea and were collected every 2 weeks if no diarrhea was reported. From routine stool cultures, five E. coli-like colonies were screened for ETEC enterotoxins using a GM1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The isolates were screened against a panel of 12 colonization factor antigens (CFAs) by a dot blot assay. A nested case-control study evaluated the association between initial or repeat excretion of ETEC and the occurrences of diarrhea. The pathogenicity of ETEC was estimated in symptomatic children compared to that in asymptomatic controls. ETEC was significantly associated with diarrhea (crude odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 1.52). The distribution of ETEC enterotoxins varied between the symptomatic children (44.2% heat-labile toxin [LT], 38.5% heat-stable toxin [ST], and 17.3% LT/ST) and asymptomatic children (55.5% LT, 34.6% ST, and 9.9% LT/ST) (P < 0.001). The CFAs CFA/I (n = 61), CS3 (n = 8), CS1 plus CS3 (n = 24), CS2 plus CS3 (n = 18), CS6 (n = 45), CS5 plus CS6 (n = 11), CS7 (n = 25), and CS14 (n = 32) were frequently detected in symptomatic children, while CS6 (n = 66), CS12 (n = 51), CFA/I (n = 43), and CS14 (n = 20) were detected at higher frequencies among asymptomatic children. While all toxin phenotypes were associated with diarrheal disease after the initial exposure, only ST and LT/ST-expressing ETEC isolates (P < 0.0001) were associated with disease in repeat infections. The role of enterotoxins and pathogenicity during repeat ETEC infections appears to be variable and dependent on the coexpression of specific CFAs.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amnioinfusion is thought to dilute meconium present in the amniotic fluid and so reduce the risk of meconium aspiration. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of amnioinfusion for meconium-stained liquor on perinatal outcome. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 December 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion for women in labour with moderate or thick meconium staining of the amniotic fluid. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies of variable quality (4435 women) are included.Subgroup analysis was performed for studies from settings with limited facilities to monitor the baby's condition during labour and intervene effectively, and settings with standard peripartum surveillance.Settings with standard peripartum surveillance: there was considerable heterogeneity for several outcomes. There was no significant reduction in the primary outcomes meconium aspiration syndrome, perinatal death or severe morbidity, and maternal death or severe morbidity. There was a reduction in caesarean sections (CSs) for fetal distress but not overall. Meconium below the vocal cords diagnosed by laryngoscopy was reduced, as was neonatal ventilation or neonatal intensive care unit admission, but there was no significant reduction in perinatal deaths or other morbidity. Planned sensitivity analysis excluding trials with greater risk of bias resulted in an absence of benefits for any of the outcomes studied.Settings with limited peripartum surveillance: three studies were included. In the amnioinfusion group there was a reduction in CS for fetal distress and overall; meconium aspiration syndrome (three studies, 1144 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.52); perinatal mortality (three studies, 1151 women; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.53) and neonatal ventilation or neonatal intensive care unit admission. In one of the studies, meconium below the vocal cords was reduced and, in the other, neonatal encephalopathy was reduced. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Amnioinfusion is associated with substantive improvements in perinatal outcome only in settings where facilities for perinatal surveillance are limited. It is not clear whether the benefits are due to dilution of meconium or relief of oligohydramnios.In settings with standard peripartum surveillance, some non-substantive outcomes were improved in the initial analysis, but sensitivity analysis excluding trials with greater risk of bias eliminated these differences. Amnioinfusion is either ineffective in this setting, or its effects are masked by other strategies to optimise neonatal outcome.The trials reviewed are too small to address the possibility of rare but serious maternal adverse effects of amnioinfusion.",

Use of PCR and genotyping has markedly improved the detection rate of HPeV but has simultaneously raised questions about the clinical relevance of positive tests. This retrospective study correlates positive HPeV1 or HPeV3 PCR tests in stools from children with their symptoms to determine clinical relevance. Children with HPeV1- or HPeV3-positive stool samples, as detected by real time RT-PCR and direct genotyping, between 2004 and 2008 were selected. Clinical data were retrospectively collected from the patient's files and results were compared. One hundred and thirty-eight children with positive HPeV1 (n = 112) or HPeV3 (n = 26) stool samples were identified. Significantly more HPeV3-infected children were neonates or infants younger than 6 months of age. Meningitis or sepsis-like illnesses were diagnosed most frequently and were found in significantly younger children. Almost half of HPeV1-infected children had an underlying disease. Mild gastrointestinal disease was seen most frequently in these children. There was no clear correlation between viral load (Ct value) and severity of symptoms. In conclusion, HPeV3 detected by PCR in stool samples is associated with clinically relevant disease. For HPeV1, a positive stool sample is mainly associated with symptoms in children with underlying disease.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence and outcomes of cholestasis and meconium ileus (MI) in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single-centre study. PATIENTS: From January 1986 to December 2011, 401 infants with CF (69 with MI) presented to our centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: (1) incidence of cholestasis, (2) identification of risk factors for cholestasis, (3) association between the presence of cholestasis and MI and the development of clinically significant CF-associated liver disease (CFLD) defined as multilobular cirrhosis with portal hypertension. RESULTS: Cholestasis occurred in 23 of 401 infants (5.7%). There was a significantly higher incidence of cholestasis in infants with MI (27.1%) compared to those without MI (1.2%) (p<0.001). Infants with MI had a 30.36-fold increased risk of developing cholestasis compared to those without MI (p<0.001). Cholestasis resolved in all children, at a median (range) age of 9.2 (0.8-53.2) months in the MI group and 10.2 (2.0-19.4) months in the non-MI group. The majority of cholestatic infants (87.0%) and infants with MI (92.8%) did not develop clinically significant CFLD, not significantly different than either the 93.9% of non-cholestatic infants nor the 93.7% infants without MI. CONCLUSIONS: Cholestasis is an uncommon condition in CF affecting only 5.7% of the screened newborn CF population. The greatest risk factor for developing cholestasis is the presence of MI. However, the presence of MI appears not to be associated with the development of CFLD. An effect of neonatal cholestasis on the development of CFLD cannot be excluded by this study.",

The aim of this work was to optimize the study of Staphylococcus species diversity in human breast milk and neonate stool, two sample types with bacterial communities dominated by CoNS, using PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis based on the tuf gene. The optimized protocol identified 18 Staphylococcus species involved in neonate gut microbiota and infections and was applied to cultivation-independent study of breast milk and neonate stool.

			"abstract": "PURPOSE: The majority of bowel obstructions in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates are meconium-related ileus (MRI). ELBW neonates with bowel obstruction may recover by conservative treatment, but some do not. Considering the high surgical morbidity rates, unnecessary surgery should be avoided. We sought to identify a reasonable treatment strategy under these conditions. METHODS: ELBW neonates who started to have bowel obstruction with an unclear cause within 14 days of age were enrolled. The study period was from January 2009 to August 2011. The enrolled patients had daily Gastrografin((R)) enemas until 14 days of age or until the obstruction resolved. If the obstruction lasted beyond around 14 days of age, the patient underwent surgical intervention. The clinical data of the patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled. Twelve patients had MRI, which resolved within 14 days without surgery. Two patients with persistent obstruction underwent surgery, and they were found to have Hirschsprung's disease and ileal volvulus, respectively. CONCLUSION: For ELBW neonates with bowel obstruction of unclear etiology, the early and frequent administration of a Gastrografin((R)) enema is reasonable. Surgery should be considered if the obstruction lasts beyond approximately 14 days after birth.",

			"abstract": "The interplay between diet and the microbiota has been implicated in the growing frequency of chronic diseases associated with the Western lifestyle. However, the complexity and variability of microbial ecology in humans and preclinical models has hampered identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying the association of the microbiota in this context. We sought to address two key questions. Can the microbial ecology of preclinical models predict human populations? And can we identify underlying principles that surpass the plasticity of microbial ecology in humans? To do this, we focused our study on diet; perhaps the most influential factor determining the composition of the gut microbiota. Beginning with a study in 'humanized' mice we identified an interactive module of 9 genera allied with Western diet intake. This module was applied to a controlled dietary study in humans. The abundance of the Western ecological module correctly predicted the dietary intake of 19/21 top and 21/21 of the bottom quartile samples inclusive of all 5 Western and 'low-fat' diet subjects, respectively. In 98 volunteers the abundance of the Western module correlated appropriately with dietary intake of saturated fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins and fiber. Furthermore, it correlated with the geographical location and dietary habits of healthy adults from the Western, developing and third world. The module was also coupled to dietary intake in children (and piglets) correlating with formula (vs breast) feeding and associated with a precipitous development of the ecological module in young children. Our study provides a conceptual platform to translate microbial ecology from preclinical models to humans and identifies an ecological network module underlying the association of the gut microbiota with Western dietary habits.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association of grand multiparity and poor pregnancy outcome has not been consistent for decades. Classifying grand multiparous women as a high-risk group without clear evidence of a consistent association with adverse outcomes can lead to socioeconomic burdens to the mother, family and health systems. We compared the maternal and perinatal complications among grand multiparous and other multiparous women in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). A standard questionnaire enquired the following variables: demographic characteristics, antenatal profile and detected obstetric risk factors as well as maternal and neonatal risk factors. Predictors of adverse outcomes in relation to grand multiparous women were assessed at p = 0.05. RESULTS: Grand multiparas had twice the likelihood of malpresentation and a threefold higher prevalence of meconium-stained liquor and placenta previa compared with lower-parity women even when adjusted for age. Neonates delivered by grand multiparous women (12.1%) were at three-time greater risk of a low Apgar score compared with lower-parity women (5.4%) (odds ratio (OR), 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-5.0). Grand multiparity and low birth weight were independently associated with a low Apgar score (OR, 2.4; 95%, CI 1.4-4.2 for GM; OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.3-7.8) for low birth weight. CONCLUSION: Grand multiparity remains a risk in pregnancy and is associated with an increased prevalence of maternal and neonatal complications (malpresentation, meconium-stained liquor, placenta previa and a low Apgar score) compared with other multiparous women who delivered at Muhimbili National Hospital.",

In light of the implementation of rotavirus vaccines of limited valency, it is important to characterize the genotypic diversity of circulating rotavirus in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We collected stool samples from children 0-59 months of age who presented at the health centres as cases with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in the Upper River Region of The Gambia. Stool samples were also collected from age, sex and area-matched healthy controls. All stool samples were assayed for rotavirus antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and genotyping was done using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We enrolled 1029 cases and 1569 controls during the 3-year study period (2008-2010). The detection rate of rotavirus among the cases was 20% (204/1029) and 3% (42/1569) among controls. At least 18 genotypes were found and the predominant genotypes were G2P[6] (28%), G1P[8] (26%) and G1P[10] (10%). The rare identified genotypes (<1%) were G2P[14], G8P[6], G9P[6] and G4P[10]. There was also a strong positive association between rotavirus infection and the dry season (odds ratio: 9.83, 95% confidence interval: 6.18-15.63, P < 0.001). A significant increase in the odds of rotavirus and G1P[8] detection with the use of untreated water and the presence of cats, rodents and cows in the child's residence was also found. CONCLUSION: This study provides important baseline data for the genotypes circulating before vaccine implementation. The wide diversity of genotypes circulating in The Gambia implies the need for vigilant effectiveness surveillance following the implementation of RotaTeq in August 2013.",

The anticipated introduction of rotavirus vaccine into Togo's national immunization program highlights the need for baseline data on the burden of this disease. METHODS: We conducted sentinel surveillance for rotavirus gastroenteritis among children <5 years of age in Sylvanus Olympio Teaching Hospital of Lome (Togo) from February 2008 through January 2012, based on the World Health Organization's generic protocol. Rotavirus was detected in stool specimens by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The strain characterization by genotyping was performed at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in Accra (Ghana) and at Medunsa campus in Pretoria (South Africa). RESULTS: 803 children with acute gastroenteritis were enrolled and of which 390 (48%) were positive for rotavirus. The difference of age among children with rotavirus and nonrotavirus gastroenteritis was significant (P < 0.010) with rotavirus cases younger than nonrotavirus cases. From December to February, significantly (P < 0.002) more cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis were enrolled compared with other months of the year. Vomiting (P = 0.04) was more common in children with rotavirus than nonrotavirus gastroenteritis. The most common G-P combinations were G3P[6] (23%), G1P[8] (12%), G1P[6/8] (8%), G2P[6] (7%), G12P[6] (7%) and G3/12P[6] (6%).

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To validate established neonatal neutrophil reference ranges (RRs) and determine the utility of serial measurements of neutrophil values in the first 24 hours to predict the absence of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 2073 admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (2009-2011). Neonates were classified as blood culture-positive, proven EOS (n = 9), blood culture-negative but clinically suspect EOS (n = 292), and not infected (n = 1292). Neutrophil values from 745 not-infected neonates without perinatal complications were selected to validate RR distributions. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated; area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were constructed to predict the presence or absence of EOS. Neutrophil value scores were established to determine whether serial neutrophil values predict the absence of EOS. RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit were evaluated for EOS: 9 (0.56%) had proven EOS with positive blood culture </= 37 hours; 18% had clinically suspect EOS. Neutropenia occurred in preterm neonates, and nonspecific neutrophilia was common in uninfected neonates. The distribution of neutrophil values differed significantly between study groups. The specificity for absolute total immature neutrophils and immature to total neutrophil proportions was 91% and 94%, respectively, with negative predictive value of 99% for proven and 78% for proven plus suspect EOS. Absolute total immature neutrophils and immature to total neutrophil proportions had the best predictability for EOS >6 hours postnatal with an AUC  approximately  0.8. Neutrophil value scores predicted the absence of EOS with AUC of 0.9 and 0.81 for proven and proven plus suspect EOS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Age-dependent neutrophil RRs remain valid. Serial neutrophil values at 0, 12, and 24 hours plus blood culture and clinical evaluation can be used to discontinue antimicrobial therapy at 36-48 hours.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess microbial diversity and characterize the dominant bacteria in stool during the first year of life in relation to the prevalence of different allergic diseases in school age, such as asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and eczema. METHODS: The microbial diversity and composition was analysed with barcoded 16S rDNA 454 pyrosequencing in stool samples at 1 week, 1 month and 12 months of age in 47 infants which were subsequently assessed for allergic disease and skin prick test reactivity at 7 years of age (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01285830). RESULTS: Children developing asthma (n = 8) had a lower diversity of the total microbiota than non-asthmatic children at 1 week (P = 0.04) and 1 month (P = 0.003) of age, whereas allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (n = 13), eczema (n = 12) and positive skin prick reactivity (n = 14) at 7 years of age did not associate with the gut microbiota diversity. Neither was asthma associated with the microbiota composition later in infancy (at 12 months). Children having IgE-associated eczema in infancy and subsequently developing asthma had lower microbial diversity than those that did not. There were no significant differences, however, in relative abundance of bacterial phyla and genera between children with or without allergic disease.

			"abstract": "Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is the standard of care during pregnancy for opioid-dependency, showing efficacy in improving prenatal care and reducing risk of relapse. By design, however, MMT is only intended to prevent withdrawal thus facilitating cognitive behavioural interventions. In order to maximize the benefits of MMT, it is essential that methadone is both properly prescribed and that additional addiction treatment is concurrently administered. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of MMT engagement in high-risk pregnant women in reducing polydrug use by objective laboratory examination of neonatal meconium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 29-month period, the Motherisk Laboratory at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto analyzed meconium samples as per request by social services and hospitals for drugs of abuse. RESULTS: Of the 904 meconium samples received, 273 were tested for methadone with 164 positive and 109 negative for methadone. Almost half of the methadone positive samples (46.34%) were also positive for at least one other opioid compound, which did not differ statistically from the methadone-negative control samples (46.79%; Chi square test, p=0.94). No differences were found between the methadone positive and negative groups in rates of concurrent amphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, and alcohol use indicating a similar risk of polydrug use between pregnant women taking or not taking methadone in this population. DISCUSSION: The high rates of additional opioid and other drug use in the MMT group, suggest that MMT is failing this population of patients. It is possible that methadone doses during pregnancy are not appropriately adjusted for changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. blood volume, renal function) during the second and third trimesters. This may result in sub-therapeutic dosing creating withdrawal symptoms leading to additional substance use. Alternatively, these results may be demonstrating a substantial lack in delivery of addiction support services in this vulnerable population.",

Our results show that the carcinogen IQ greatly increased FW genotoxicity (up to 16.92 +/- 3.03 U/mg) and the activity of fecal enzymes (up to even 1.4 +/- 0.16 U/mg) in 15 individuals (children, adults and elderly). After incubation with IQ, the activity of beta-glucuronidase was reduced by Lactobacillus bacteria by 76.0% (Lb. paracasei 0908) in the FW of children, and by 82.0% (Lb. paracasei 0919) in the elderly; while that of beta-glucosidase was reduced by 55.0% in children (Lb. casei 0908) and 90.0% (Lb. paracasei 0919) in elderly subjects. Lactobacilli decreased the genotoxicity of FW after incubation with IQ to the greatest extent in adults (by 64.5%). Probiotic lactobacilli, in the presence of IQ, efficiently inhibits activity of fecal enzymes to the level of control. Genotoxicity inhibition depends on the person's age, its individual microbiota and diet.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of the gut microbiota in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants with and without necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) between April 2008 and December 2009, fecal microflora was prospectively analyzed in fecal samples of all ELBW infants using real-time PCR assays. In addition, fecal inflammatory were measured. RESULTS: Fecal microflora established early in ELBW infants and microbiota composition remained stable over the first 28 days of life except for the prevalence of C. difficile which decreased with decreasing antibiotic use. Infants who subsequently developed NEC had an increase of total bacterial count (9.8-fold) 24 h prior to clinical symptoms mainly due to the expansion of E. coli species (21.6-fold), whereas microbiota composition did not differ from healthy ELBW infants five days before onset of NEC. Importantly, S100A12 and hBD2 positively correlated with the total and E. coli bacterial CFU/g feces (r (2) 0.4 and 0.64, resp.). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found evidence for a disturbed homeostasis between the intestinal microbiome and host immunity in ELBW infants with NEC. Moreover, S100A12 and hBD2 correlate with the fecal microbiota thus linking the intestinal innate immune response to the bacterial colonization thus possibly providing a diagnostic tool in the future.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism in which high phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations in the central nervous system adversely affect its development and functioning. In PKU high oxidative stress and inefficiency of free radical scavenging may lead to systemic chronic inflammation. We hypothesised that in PKU gut mucosa is chronically inflamed and that this leads to release of calprotectin from neutrophils and monocytes. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare intestinal mucosa inflammation status, as measured using fecal calprotectin, in patients with PKU irrespective of compliance, and healthy controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with classical PKU were included in the study (21 male, 23 female; aged 0-41 years; mean +/- SEM: 16.5 +/- 1.7 years). Forty-eight healthy subjects (HS) aged 9-68 years (29.4 +/- 2.6 years) comprised the control group, of whom 21 were male and 27 female. Among PKU patients 25 had normal Phe blood concentrations and in 19 they were elevated. In all subjects calprotectin stool concentrations were assessed (PhiCal ELISA, Calpro, Lysaker, Norway). RESULTS: Normal FC (fecal calprotectin) concentrations were found in 43 (97.7%) PKU patients and 46 (95.8%) HS. No correlation between dietary control of Phe blood concentrations and FC levels in PKU patients was found. CONCLUSIONS: No detectable intestinal inflammation occurs in phenylketonuria. Lack of dietary control and elevated Phe levels do not seem to be risk factors for inflammation of the mucosa of the gut.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human noroviruses are among the most common enteropathogens globally, and are a leading cause of infant diarrhea in developing countries. However, data measuring the impact of norovirus at the community level are sparse. METHODS: We followed a birth cohort of children to estimate norovirus infection and diarrhea incidence in a Peruvian community. Stool samples from diarrheal episodes and randomly selected nondiarrheal samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction for norovirus genogroup and genotype. Excretion duration and rotavirus coinfection were evaluated in a subset of episodes. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty and 189 children were followed to 1 and 2 years of age, respectively. By 1 year, 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75%-85%) experienced at least 1 norovirus infection and by 2 years, 71% (95% CI, 65%-77%) had at least 1 episode of norovirus-associated diarrhea. Genogroup II (GII) infections were 3 times more frequent than genogroup 1 (GI) infections. Eighteen genotypes were found; GII genotype 4 accounted for 41%. Median excretion duration was 34.5 days for GII vs 8.5 days for GI infection (P = .0006). Repeat infections by the same genogroup were common, but repeat infections by the same genotype were rare. Mean length-for-age z score at 12 months was lower among children with prior norovirus infection compared to uninfected children (coefficient: -0.33 [95% CI, -.65 to -.01]; P = .04); the effect persisted at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Norovirus infection occurs early in life and children experience serial infections with multiple genotypes, suggesting genotype-specific immunity. An effective vaccine would have a substantial impact on morbidity, but may need to target multiple genotypes.",

The water-soluble contrast medium is evacuated through the anus as well as excreted via the kidneys in some babies. This study was designed to evaluate the incidence of renal excretion after enemas using water-soluble contrast media and presume the causes. METHODS: Contrast enemas using diluted water-soluble contrast media were performed in 23 patients under 2 months of age. After the enema, patients were followed with simple abdominal radiographs to assess the improvement in bowel distention, and we could also detect the presence of renal excretion of contrast media on the radiographs. Reviewing the medical records and imaging studies, including enemas and consecutive abdominal radiographs, we evaluated the incidence of renal excretion of water-soluble contrast media and counted the stay duration of contrast media in urinary tract, bladder, and colon. RESULTS: Among 23 patients, 12 patients (52%) experienced the renal excretion of water-soluble contrast media. In these patients, stay-in-bladder durations of contrast media were 1-3 days and stay-in-colon durations of contrast media were 1-10 days, while stay-in-colon durations of contrast media were 1-3 days in the patients not showing renal excretion of contrast media. The Mann-Whitney test for stay-in-colon durations demonstrated the later evacuation of contrast media in the patients with renal excretion of contrast media (p = 0.07). The review of the medical records showed that 19 patients were finally diagnosed as intestinal diseases, including Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileum, meconium plug syndrome, and small bowel atresia or stenosis. Fisher's exact test between the presence of urinary excretion and intestinal diseases indicated a statistically significant difference (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The intestinal diseases causing bowel obstruction may increase the water-soluble contrast media's dwell time in the bowel and also increase urinary excretion.",

We aimed to determine the risk factors and to evaluate prospectively the clinical course of MRB. METHODS: We consecutively included in a case-control study all infants with birth weight </= 1500 g or gestational age </= 32 weeks admitted to our unit, and presenting MRB, defined as either isolated or associated with mild clinical or radiological signs. We matched each Case with two Controls. Clinical data before, after and at time of MRB were collected, together with stool cultures at time of MRB (or at similar postnatal age in Controls). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for the development of MRB. RESULTS: During 4 years, among 823 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants admitted to our unit, 72 (8.8%) had MRB. The median duration of rectal bleeding was 1.1 [1-2] days and the fasting period lasted 2.9 [2-10] days. A relapse occurred in 24% of cases. In multivariate analysis, only hypertension during pregnancy (p = 0.019), growth restriction at onset of bleeding (p = 0.026), and exposure to ibuprofen (p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for MRB. In Cases there were more infants with Clostridium Difficile in stools than in Controls (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Hypertension during pregnancy, even without intrauterine growth restriction, appeared to carry the same risk for MRB as exposure to ibuprofen and extrauterine growth restriction.",

			"abstract": "Drug abuse by pregnant women is considered a serious public health problem worldwide. Meconium is the first excretion in newborns and has been used as an alternative matrix to evaluate in utero drug exposure. Solid phase extraction (SPE) is widely employed to prepare and clean up samples in the field of forensic analysis. Most SPE products require large volumes of solvent, which culminates in longer sample processing times and increased cost per sample. Disposable pipette extraction (DPX) tips have been used as an alternative to traditional SPE cartridges. They combine efficient and rapid extraction with reduced solvent consumption. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a method to determine nicotine, cotinine, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, cocaethylene and methyl ester anhydroecgonine in meconium using DPX and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Validation results indicated that extraction efficiency ranged 50-98%, accuracy 92-106%, intra-assay precision 4-12% and inter-assay precision 6-12%. Linear calibration curves resulted in R(2) values >0.99, limits of detection ranged from 2.5 to 15 ng/g and the limit of quantitation from 10 to 20 ng/g. The DPX-GC-MS method was shown to selectively analyze trace concentrations of drugs in meconium samples. Finally, the developed and validated method was applied to 50 meconium samples.",

			"abstract": "RATIONALE: Previous studies of risk factors for progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) have suffered from limitations that preclude a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of CF lung disease throughout childhood. The epidemiologic component of the 27-year Wisconsin Randomized Clinical Trial of CF Neonatal Screening Project (WI RCT) afforded us a unique opportunity to evaluate the significance of potential intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for lung disease in children with CF. OBJECTIVES: Describe the most important intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for progression of lung disease in children with CF. METHODS: Variables hypothesized at the onset of the WI RCT study to be determinants of the progression of lung disease and potential risk factors previously identified in the WI RCT study were assessed with multivariable generalized estimating equation models for repeated measures of chest radiograph scores and pulmonary function tests in the WI RCT cohort. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Combining all patients in the WI RCT, 132 subjects were observed for a mean of 16 years and contributed 1,579 chest radiographs, and 1,792 pulmonary function tests. The significant determinants of lung disease include genotype, poor growth, hospitalizations, meconium ileus, and infection with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The previously described negative effect of female sex was not seen. CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable extrinsic risk factors are the major determinants of progression of lung disease in children with CF. Better interventions to prevent or treat these risk factors may lead to improvements in lung health for children with CF.",

			"article_name": "Diversified microbiota of meconium is affected by maternal diabetes status.",
			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the diversity of the meconium microbiome and determine if the bacterial community is affected by maternal diabetes status. METHODS: The first intestinal discharge (meconium) was collected from 23 newborns stratified by maternal diabetes status: 4 mothers had pre-gestational type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) including one mother with dizygotic twins, 5 developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 13 had no diabetes. The meconium microbiome was profiled using multi-barcode 16S rRNA sequencing followed by taxonomic assignment and diversity analysis. RESULTS: All meconium samples were not sterile and contained diversified microbiota. Compared with adult feces, the meconium showed a lower species diversity, higher sample-to-sample variation, and enrichment of Proteobacteria and reduction of Bacteroidetes. Among the meconium samples, the taxonomy analyses suggested that the overall bacterial content significantly differed by maternal diabetes status, with the microbiome of the DM group showing higher alpha-diversity than that of no-diabetes or GDM groups. No global difference was found between babies delivered vaginally versus via Cesarean-section. Regression analysis showed that the most robust predictor for the meconium microbiota composition was the maternal diabetes status that preceded pregnancy. Specifically, Bacteroidetes (phyla) and Parabacteriodes (genus) were enriched in the meconium in the DM group compared to the no-diabetes group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that meconium contains diversified microbiota and is not affected by the mode of delivery. It also suggests that the meconium microbiome of infants born to mothers with DM is enriched for the same bacterial taxa as those reported in the fecal microbiome of adult DM patients.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of gastric lavage in preventing retching, vomiting and secondary meconium aspiration syndrome in neonates with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. METHODS: This was an open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in the labour room, postnatal and neonatal wards of a tertiary-care teaching hospital. Vigorous neonates of >==34 weeks gestation with meconium-stained amniotic fluid were randomised into two groups using block randomisation. Infants requiring oxygen, in respiratory distress or with major congenital malformations were excluded. Infants in the study group received elective gastric lavage in the labour room after initial stabilisation. No gastric lavage was done in the control group. The newborns were assessed for retching, vomiting and secondary meconium aspiration syndrome in the first 48 hrs of life or until discharge from the hospital, whichever was later. RESULTS: A total of 267 newborns were randomly assigned to the gastric lavage group and 269 to the no gastric lavage group. There were no statistical differences in overall feeding between the two groups (6.74% vs 10.78%). Feeding of two newborns in the no-lavage group had to be omitted for the initial few hours because of vomiting; this did not happen in any newborn in the lavage group. No newborn in either group developed secondary meconium aspiration syndrome.

			"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the composition and richness of bacterial communities associated with low-birthweight (LBW) infants in relation to host body site, individual, and age. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes from saliva samples, skin swabs, and stool samples collected on postnatal days 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, and 21 from six LBW (five premature) infants were amplified, pyrosequenced, and analyzed within a comparative framework that included analogous data from normal-birthweight (NBW) infants and healthy adults. We found that body site was the primary determinant of bacterial community composition in the LBW infants. However, site specificity depended on postnatal age: saliva and stool compositions diverged over time but were not significantly different until the babies were 15 days old. This divergence was primarily driven by progressive temporal turnover in the distal gut, which proceeded at a rate similar to that of age-matched NBW infants. Neonatal skin was the most adult-like in microbiota composition, while saliva and stool remained the least so. Compositional variation among infants was marked and depended on body site and age. Only the smallest, most premature infant received antibiotics during the study period; this heralded a coexpansion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a novel Mycoplasma sp. in the oral cavity of this vaginally delivered, intubated patient. We conclude that concurrent molecular surveillance of multiple body sites in LBW neonates reveals a delayed compositional differentiation of the oral cavity and distal gut microbiota and, in the case of one infant, an abundant, uncultivated oral Mycoplasma sp., recently detected in human vaginal samples. IMPORTANCE: Complications of premature birth are the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Colonization by the indigenous microbiota, which begins at delivery, may predispose some high-risk newborns to invasive infection or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and protect others, yet neonatal microbiome dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we present the first cultivation-independent time series tracking microbiota assembly across multiple body sites in a synchronous cohort of hospitalized low-birthweight (LBW) neonates. We take advantage of archived samples and publically available sequence data and compare our LBW infant findings to those from normal-birthweight (NBW) infants and healthy adults. Our results suggest potential windows of opportunity for the dispersal of microbes within and between hosts and support recent findings of substantial baseline spatiotemporal variation in microbiota composition among high-risk newborns.",

However, the studies to date have not characterised the patterns of expression in healthy young children. This study aimed to determine S100A12 levels in infants and children without symptoms of underlying gut disease. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from healthy infants (<12 months) and children without gastrointestinal symptoms. Faecal S100A12 was measured by immunoassay. RESULTS: Fifty-six children were recruited. Serial samples were obtained from seven term infants over the first 6 months of life. Single samples were obtained from 49 healthy children ranging from 0.16 to 13.8 years of age. Median S100A12 levels were 0.5 mg/kg (ranging from 0.39 to 25) in the healthy children, with high values (>10 mg/kg) in five infants only. There was no variation between gender. Median S100A12 levels in healthy infants remained below the established normal cut-off from birth to six months of age. CONCLUSION: S100A12 levels in well infants and children are almost exclusively lower than the standard cut-off. Transiently higher levels may be seen in early infancy. An elevated level of S100A12 in children older than 12 months of age is likely to represent organic gut disease.",

In Brazil, the most frequent genotype identified was G1 during almost three decades in the pre-vaccination period; however, after anti-rotavirus vaccine introduction, there was a predominance of G2 genotype. The aim of this study was to determine the G and P genotypes of rotaviruses isolated from children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis in the Northern region of Brazil, and discuss the emergence of G3P[6] genotype. A total of 783 stool specimens were obtained between January 2011 and March 2012. RVA antigen was detected in 33% (272/783) of samples using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and type-specificity was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The most common binary combination was G2P[4], representing 41% of cases, followed by G3P[6] (15%), G1P[8] (8%), G3P[8] (4%), G9P[8] (3%), and G12P[6] (2%). G3P[6] strains were analyzed further and phylogenetic analysis of VP7 gene showed that G3 strains clustered into lineage I and showed a high degree of amino acid identity with vaccine strain RV3 (95.1-95.6%). For VP4 sequences, G3P[6] clustered into lineage Ia. It was demonstrated by the first time the emergence of unusual genotype G3P[6] in the Amazon region of Brazil. This genotype shares neither VP7 nor VP4 specificity with the used vaccine and may represent a challenge to vaccination strategies. A continuous monitoring of circulating strains is therefore needed during the post-vaccine era in Brazil.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: For many years Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state, has had the highest rate of child mortality due to intestinal infections of unknown etiology in the country. To begin identifying the infectious agents, our work determined the prevalence of intestinal parasites as well as malnutrition in children from Chiapas's three most impoverished municipalities: Pantepec, Chanal, and Larrainzar. METHODOLOGY: In this cross-sectional study, conducted between January and November 2009, we assessed the prevalence of intestinal parasites by means of coproparasitological analysis in children <5 years of age (N=250) from three of the marginalized municipalities: Pantepec, Chanal and Larrainzar. The prevalence of malnutrition was then assessed using the Mexican official norm NOM-031-SSA2-1999 and WHO criteria. We evaluated the association between age (breast-fed and pre-school children) with parasites and nutritional status. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed the highest prevalence of intestinal parasites in children from Pantepec (62.8%), followed by Chanal (47.3%), and then Larrainzar (11.9 %). The nematode Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent enteroparasite (33.6%). Anthropometric analysis revealed that >40% of children represented varying degrees of malnutrition and a marked constitutional delay in growth. A very high prevalence of stunting was also recorded in children from Chanal and Larrainzar (70% and 55%, respectively). An association between infection with intestinal parasites and malnutrition was observed in Pantepec. Preschool-age children were more likely to be infected with intestinal parasites. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the urgent need for interventions in order to 1) improve the nutritional status of children and 2) reduce infection rates of enteric parasites.",

			"abstract": "The gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of the immune and gastrointestinal systems of infants. In the present study, we investigated whether increased salmon consumption during pregnancy, maternal weight gain during pregnancy or mode of infant feeding alter the markers of gut immune defence and inflammation. Women (n 123) who rarely ate oily fish were randomly assigned to continue consuming their habitual diet or to consume two 150 g portions of farmed salmon per week from 20 weeks of pregnancy to delivery. Faecal samples were collected from the mothers (n 75) at 38 weeks of gestation and from their infants (n 38) on days 7, 14, 28 and 84 post-partum. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to determine faecal microbiota composition and ELISA to measure faecal secretory IgA (sIgA) and calprotectin concentrations. There was no effect of salmon consumption on maternal faecal microbiota or on maternal or infant faecal sIgA and calprotectin concentrations. The degree of weight gain influenced maternal faecal microbiota, and the mode of infant feeding influenced infant faecal microbiota. Faecal samples collected from infants in the salmon group tended to have lower bacterial counts of the Atopobium cluster compared with those collected from infants in the control group (P=0.097). This difference was significant in the formula-fed infants (P< 0.05), but not in the exclusively breast-fed infants. In conclusion, the impact of oily fish consumption during pregnancy on maternal and infant gut microbiota composition is limited, but significant differences are associated with maternal weight gain during pregnancy and mode of infant feeding.",

Using a combination of Sanger sequencing of amplicon mixtures (without cloning), real-time quantitative PCR and deep pyrosequencing, we observed a clear age-related colonization pattern in children that was surprisingly evident between 3- and 10-day samples. In contrast, we did not observe any shifts in microbial composition during pregnancy. We found that alpha-diversity was highest at 2 years and lowest at 4 months, whereas beta-diversity estimates indicated highest interindividual variation in newborns. Variation significantly decreased by the age of 10 days and was observed to be convergent over time; however, there were still major differences between 2 years and adults whom exhibited the lowest interindividual diversity. Taken together, the major age-affiliated population shift within gut microbiota suggests that there are important mechanisms for transmission and persistence of gut bacteria that remain unknown.",

Rotavirus and norovirus have been recognized as the most common pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis among children. However, there is still no valuable data about infections of rotavirus and norovirus in children in Ji'nan, an eastern city in China. The aims of the present study are to determine the incidence of rotavirus and norovirus associated acute gastroenteritis in Ji'nan among children, to characterize rotavirus and norovirus strains circulating during this period; and to provide useful epidemiological and clinical data. METHODS: Fecal specimens and clinical data were collected from 767 children (502 outpatients and 265 inpatients) under 5 years of age with acute diarrhea at Shandong University Qilu Hospital and Qilu children's Hospital in Ji'nan, China between February 2011 and January 2012. Virus RNA was extracted, amplified, electrophoresed, sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed to determine the prevalent genotypes. Chi-square and U test were used to compare characteristics of clinical manifestation in each group. RESULTS: Of the 767 specimens 263 (34.3%) were positive for rotavirus and 80 (10.4%) were positive for norovirus. Among 263 rotavirus positive cases, G3 (40.7%) was the most prevalent serotype, P[8] (46.8%) was the dominant genotype and G3P[8] (31.9%) was the most common combination. All of the norovirus strains belonged to GII genogroup including GII.3, GII.4 and GII.6, of which GII.4 (61.2%) was the predominant genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the GII.4 sequences showed that 18 GII.4 strains belonged to GII.4 2004-2006 cluster and 31 GII.4 strains were divided into GII.4 2006b cluster. A peak number of rotavirus infections was observed during the cold season from November to next January. Higher rates of norovirus infections were detected from September to November. Most patients with rotavirus and norovirus associated diarrhea experienced vomiting (88.2% and 67.5%, respectively) and fever (79.1% and 46.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that rotavirus and norovirus were still the important causative agents of pediatric diarrhea in Ji'nan during this period.",

			"abstract": "The existence of pleiotropy in disorders with multi-organ involvement can suggest therapeutic targets that could ameliorate overall disease severity. Here we assessed pleiotropy of modifier genes in cystic fibrosis (CF). CF, caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, affects the lungs, liver, pancreas and intestines. However, modifier genes contribute to variable disease severity across affected organs, even in individuals with the same CFTR genotype. We sought to determine whether SLC26A9, SLC9A3 and SLC6A14, that contribute to meconium ileus in CF, are pleiotropic for other early-affecting CF co-morbidities. In the Canadian CF population, we assessed evidence for pleiotropic effects on (1) pediatric lung disease severity (n = 815), (2) age at first acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (n = 730), and (3) prenatal pancreatic damage measured by immunoreactive trypsinogen (n = 126). A multiple-phenotype analytic strategy assessed evidence for pleiotropy in the presence of phenotypic correlation. We required the same alleles to be associated with detrimental effects. SLC26A9 was pleiotropic for meconium ileus and pancreatic damage (p = 0.002 at rs7512462), SLC9A3 for meconium ileus and lung disease (p = 1.5 x 10(-6) at rs17563161), and SLC6A14 for meconium ileus and both lung disease and age at first P. aeruginosa infection (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.006 at rs3788766, respectively). The meconium ileus risk alleles in SLC26A9, SLC9A3 and SLC6A14 are pleiotropic, increasing risk for other early CF co-morbidities. Furthermore, co-morbidities affecting the same organ tended to associate with the same genes. The existence of pleiotropy within this single disorder suggests that complementary therapeutic strategies to augment solute transport will benefit multiple CF-associated tissues.",

METHODS: We performed a longitudinal cohort study from birth to 1 year of age in 147 infants in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 420 episodes of diarrhea and 1385 monthly surveillance stool specimens for 32 enteropathogen gene targets. For each infant we examined enteropathogen quantities over time to ascribe each positive target as a probable or less-likely contributor to diarrhea. RESULTS: Multiple enteropathogens were detected by the first month of life. Diarrhea was associated with a state of overall pathogen excess (mean number of enteropathogen gene targets (+/- SE), 5.6 +/- 0.1 vs 4.3 +/- 0.1 in surveillance stool specimens; P < .05). After a longitudinal, quantitative approach was applied to filter out less-likely contributors, each diarrheal episode still had an average of 3.3 probable or dominant targets. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, enteropathogenic E. coli, rotavirus, and Entamoeba histolytica were the most frequent probable contributors to diarrhea. Rotavirus was enriched in moderate to severe diarrheal episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based study diarrhea seemed to be a multipathogen event and a state of enteropathogen excess above a high carriage baseline.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hookworm disease is one of the most common infections and cause of a high disease burden in the tropics and subtropics. Remotely sensed ecological data and model-based geostatistics have been used recently to identify areas in need for hookworm control. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional interview data and stool samples from 6,375 participants from nine different sites in Mbeya region, south-western Tanzania, were collected as part of a cohort study. Hookworm infection was assessed by microscopy of duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears from one stool sample from each participant. A geographic information system was used to obtain remotely sensed environmental data such as land surface temperature (LST), vegetation cover, rainfall, and elevation, and combine them with hookworm infection data and with socio-demographic and behavioral data. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression was performed on sites separately and on the pooled dataset. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Univariable analyses yielded significant associations for all ecological variables. Five ecological variables stayed significant in the final multivariable model: population density (odds ratio (OR) = 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63-0.73), mean annual vegetation density (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.06-0.18), mean annual LST during the day (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.75-0.88), mean annual LST during the night (OR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.44-1.64), and latrine coverage in household surroundings (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01-1.04). Interaction terms revealed substantial differences in associations of hookworm infection with population density, mean annual enhanced vegetation index, and latrine coverage between the two sites with the highest prevalence of infection. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports previous findings that remotely sensed data such as vegetation indices, LST, and elevation are strongly associated with hookworm prevalence. However, the results indicate that the influence of environmental conditions can differ substantially within a relatively small geographic area. The use of large-scale associations as a predictive tool on smaller scales is therefore problematic and should be handled with care.",

Knowledge of circulating strains in a population before introduction of rotavirus immunization program will be useful in evaluating the effect of the intervention. METHODS: Rotavirus was identified by enzyme immuno-assay (EIA) on stool specimens of children (age 0-59 months) hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis from August 2007 to February 2011 in Accra, Ghana. Rotavirus positive specimens were further characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Of the 2277 acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations 1099 (48.2%) were rotavirus-positive by EIA. Of the 1099 cases 977 (89%) were PAGE positive. All EIA positive specimens were further subjected to RT-PCR and 876 (79.7%) had sufficient material for characterization. Of these 876 cases, 741 (84.6%) were assigned G genotype, 709 (80.9%) P genotype, and 624 (71.2%) both G and P genotypes. We identified 8 G genotypes (G1, G2, G3, G4, G8, G9, G10, G12) and 3 P genotypes (P[4], P[6], P[8]). G1 (50.9%), G2 (18.8%), G3 (12.8%), P[8] (36.1%) and P[6] (30.7%) were the most prevalent. The most prevalent genotype combination was G1P[8] (28%). Mixed G (7.3%) and P (24.2%) genotypes were not uncommon. There was year-by-year and seasonal variations for most genotypes. CONCLUSION: There is great diversity of rotavirus strains in children with severe gastroenteritis in southern Ghana.

The present study investigated whether viable strains of gut-associated obligate anaerobes are shared between the maternal and neonatal gut ecosystem via breastfeeding. Maternal faeces, breast milk and corresponding neonatal faeces collected from seven mothers-neonate pairs at three neonatal sampling points were analyzed by culture-independent (pyrosequencing) and culture-dependent methods (16S rRNA gene sequencing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, random amplified polymorphic DNA and repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. Pyrosequencing allowed identifying gut-associated obligate anaerobic genera, like Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and members of the Clostridia (Blautia, Clostridium, Collinsella and Veillonella) shared between maternal faeces, breast milk and neonatal faeces. Using culture, a viable strain of Bifidobacterium breve was shown to be shared between all three ecosystems within one mother-neonate pair. Furthermore, pyrosequencing revealed that several butyrate-producing members of the Clostridia (Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia and Subdoligranulum) were shared between maternal faeces and breast milk. This study shows that (viable) obligate gut-associated anaerobes may be vertically transferred from mother to neonate via breastfeeding. Thus, our data support the recently suggested hypothesis of a novel way of mother-neonate communication, in which maternal gut bacteria reach breast milk via an entero-mammary pathway to influence neonatal gut colonization and maturation of the immune system.",

NoV molecular detection (genogrouping and genotyping) and viral load quantification were also performed for all samples. RESULTS: NoV were detected in 22.2% of the 418 collected stool samples (21.2% and 24.8% from the 293 symptomatic patients (SP) and the 125 asymptomatic patients (ASP) respectively). Genogroup (G) distribution was 7.5%, 10.2% and 3.4% for GI, GII and both GI/GII respectively among SP and 12.0%, 11.2% and 1.6% for GI, GII and both GI/GII, respectively, among ASP. Average viral load values were higher in SP than in ASP for GI (p = 0.03) but not for GII. Phylogenic analysis showed a high degree of genotype diversity in SP and ASP. One recombinant GII.7/GII.6 sequence was, to the best of our knowledge, detected for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: This study enabled identification of the specific molecular epidemiology of NoV strains circulating in a representative country in Eastern Africa, and additionally showed that ASP could play an important \"reservoir\" role. A high strain diversity was detected with a surprisingly high proportion of NoV GI compared to the common genotypes usually reported in comparable epidemiological studies.",

			"abstract": "The preterm gut microbiome is a complex dynamic community influenced by genetic and environmental factors and is implicated in the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis. We aimed to explore the longitudinal development of the gut microbiome in preterm twins to determine how shared environmental and genetic factors may influence temporal changes and compared this to the expressed breast milk (EBM) microbiome. Stool samples (n = 173) from 27 infants (12 twin pairs and 1 triplet set) and EBM (n = 18) from 4 mothers were collected longitudinally. All samples underwent PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis and a selected subset underwent 454 pyrosequencing. Stool and EBM shared a core microbiome dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae. The gut microbiome showed greater similarity between siblings compared to unrelated individuals. Pyrosequencing revealed a reduction in diversity and increasing dominance of Escherichia sp. preceding NEC that was not observed in the healthy twin. Antibiotic treatment had a substantial effect on the gut microbiome, reducing Escherichia sp. and increasing other Enterobacteriaceae. This study demonstrates related preterm twins share similar gut microbiome development, even within the complex environment of neonatal intensive care. This is likely a result of shared genetic and immunomodulatory factors as well as exposure to the same maternal microbiome during birth, skin contact and exposure to EBM. Environmental factors including antibiotic exposure and feeding are additional significant determinants of community structure, regardless of host genetics.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis, one of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases, is a life-threatening public health problem in Yemen especially in rural communities. This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of schistosomiasis among children in rural Yemen. METHODS/FINDINGS: Urine and faecal samples were collected from 400 children. Urine samples were examined using filtration technique for the presence of Schistosoma haematobium eggs while faecal samples were examined using formalin-ether concentration and Kato Katz techniques for the presence of S. mansoni. Demographic, socioeconomic and environmental information were collected via a validated questionnaire. Overall, 31.8% of the participants were found to be positive for schistosomiasis; 23.8% were infected with S. haematobium and 9.3% were infected with S. mansoni. Moreover, 39.5% of the participants were anaemic whereas 9.5% had hepatosplenomegaly. The prevalence of schistosomiasis was significantly higher among children aged >10 years compared to those aged </= 10 years (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that presence of other infected family member (P<0.001), low household monthly income (P = 0.003), using unsafe sources for drinking water (P = 0.003), living nearby stream/spring (P = 0.006) and living nearby pool/pond (P = 0.002) were the key factors significantly associated with schistosomiasis among these children. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that schistosomiasis is still highly prevalent in Yemen. These findings support an urgent need to start an integrated, targeted and effective schistosomiasis control programme with a mission to move towards the elimination phase. Besides periodic drug distribution, health education and community mobilisation, provision of clean and safe drinking water, introduction of proper sanitation are imperative among these communities in order to curtail the transmission and morbidity caused by schistosomiasis. Screening and treating other infected family members should also be adopted by the public health authorities in combating this infection in these communities.",

			"abstract": "This study aims to determine the clinical features and seasonal patterns associated with shigellosis, the antimicrobial resistance frequencies of the isolates obtained during the period 2006-2012 for 22 antibiotics, and the molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant strains isolated from endemic cases of shigellosis in the remote islands of India, with special reference to fluoroquinolone and third-generation cephalosporins resistance. During the period from January 2006 to December 2011, stool samples were obtained and processed to isolate Shigella spp. The isolates were evaluated with respect to their antibiotic resistance pattern and various multidrug resistance determinants, including resistance genes, quinolone resistance determinants, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. Morbidity for shigellosis was found to be 9.3 % among children in these islands. Cases of shigellosis occurred mainly during the rainy seasons and were found to be higher in the age group 2-5 years. A wide spectrum of resistance was observed among the Shigella strains, and more than 50 % of the isolates were multidrug-resistant. The development of multidrug-resistant strains was found to be associated with various drug-resistant genes, multiple mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), and the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistant determinants and efflux pump mediators. This report represents the first presentation of the results of long-term surveillance and molecular characterization concerning antimicrobial resistances in clinical Shigella strains in these islands. Information gathered as part of the investigations will be instrumental in identifying emerging antimicrobial resistance, for developing treatment guidelines appropriate for that community, and to provide baseline data with which to compare outbreak strains in the future.",

Screening of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) is not yet a routine practice in most hospitals. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors of fecal carriage of ESBL-E in hospitalized patients. A total of 174 samples (from 97 patients) was collected. Screening test was accomplished using commercial chromogenic medium (ChromID ESBL agar; bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The presence of ESBLs of grown isolates was confirmed by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Analysis of the risk factors of ESBL-E carriage was performed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the risk factors, multivariate analysis demonstrated that prolonged hospitalization (>/=90 days) (odds ratio [OR], 6.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-39.23; P = .033), prolonged intensive care unit stay (>/=14 days) (OR, 4.78; 95% CI: 1.70-13.42; P = .003), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage (OR, 3.29; 95% CI: 1.20-9.01; P = .020) were found to be significantly associated with fecal carriers. CONCLUSION: This study clarified the characteristics and the risk factors of hospitalized patients carrying ESBL-E. In addition, the cost-benefit of routine screening in addition to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resitant Enterococci needs to be assessed.",

These vaccines are optional and are not included in the National Childhood Immunization Program. This study aimed to determine the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis-associated hospitalizations among children <5 years of age. METHODS: Children <5 years, who were hospitalized for acute gastro enteritis, were enrolled between September 2005 and April 2008. Stool samples were tested for the presence and serotyping of rotavirus. Incidence and proportion of gastroenteritis and rotavirus gastroenteritis cases were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among 1976 children included in the according-to-protocol cohort, 781 were rotavirus positive with a median age of 24 months (range: 0-59 months). The overall incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalizations during the entire study period in children <5 years of age was 4.6 (95% confidence interval: 4.3-4.9) per 1000 person-years with the highest number of cases observed in children 13-24 months of age (26.5%). G1P[8] (18.3%) and G9P[8] (9.9%) were the most common rotavirus types. Rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalizations peaked between January and March. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus infection was the primary cause of acute gastro enteritis hospitalizations among children <5 years of age, constituting nearly one-third of gastroenteritis hospitalizations in Singapore. The predominant strain observed in Singapore was G1P[8]. Results of this study suggest the need for implementation of rotavirus vaccination into National Childhood Immunization Program in Singapore.",

In Paraguay, acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is the third cause of mortality in children </=5 years old. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the presence and diversity of NoV in Paraguayan children </=5 years old presenting AGE. STUDY DESIGN: Three hundred seventy eight fecal samples, negative for pathogenic bacteria and RVA, were collected from children admitted as ambulatory and hospitalized patients in a large private hospital from Asuncion, Paraguay from 2004 to 2005. The presence and diversity of NoV was determined by two different RT-PCR strategies and nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty one samples were positive for NoV by partial amplification of the viral polymerase gene (RdRp). No seasonality or differences in the viral prevalence for the different age-groups were detected. GII and GI NoVs were associated to 58% and 42% of the infections, respectively. The genotype was determined in 18% (29/161) NoV-positive samples. The genotypes detected were: GII.4 (18%), GII.17 (18%), GII.6 (14%), GII.7 (14%), GII.3 (10%), GII.5 (3%), GII.8 (3%), GII.16 (3%), GI.3 (14%) and GI.8 (3%). Amplification of the ORF2 from the GII.4 strains showed the presence of a new GII.4 variant. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a continuous circulation of NoV in children throughout the two years of study and an extensive diversity of genotypes co-circulating, highlighting the need for better surveillance of NoV in Paraguayan children.",

Here we address how microbiota development in infants is affected by mode of delivery, and relate differences in colonisation patterns to the maturation of a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. DESIGN: The postnatal intestinal colonisation pattern was investigated in 24 infants, born vaginally (15) or by CS (nine). The intestinal microbiota were characterised using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after birth. Venous blood levels of Th1- and Th2-associated chemokines were measured at 6, 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Infants born through CS had lower total microbiota diversity during the first 2 years of life. CS delivered infants also had a lower abundance and diversity of the Bacteroidetes phylum and were less often colonised with the Bacteroidetes phylum. Infants born through CS had significantly lower levels of the Th1-associated chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 in blood. CONCLUSIONS: CS was associated with a lower total microbial diversity, delayed colonisation of the Bacteroidetes phylum and reduced Th1 responses during the first 2 years of life.",

Long-term surveillance studies of rotavirus gastroenteritis in Malawian children have provided an opportunity to undertake a study of the importance and epidemiological features of norovirus infection in this population. Faecal specimens were collected from children <5 years of age admitted to hospital with acute diarrhoea, as well as from a comparison group of diarrhoea-free children, in Blantyre, Malawi between 1997 and 2007. Norovirus was detected using real-time PCR and strains genotyped by nucleotide sequence analysis. Norovirus was detected in 220/1,941 (11.3%) faecal specimens, comprising genogroup GI (1.8%), GII (9.4%) and mixed GI/GII (0.1%). The median age of children with norovirus was 6 months (range, 0-48 months). Norovirus was detected throughout the year, with peaks at the end of the rainy season (March) and towards the end of the dry season (August-November). Norovirus GII.4 was the most commonly detected genotype accounting for 70% of strains characterised, followed by GII.2 (6%), GII.6 (4%) and GII.12 (4%). Sub typing of GII.4 noroviruses demonstrated local circulation of strains prior to their subsequent detection in association with global epidemics of gastroenteritis. The prevalence of norovirus in children without diarrhoea was similar to the level in cases. This largest study to date of norovirus infection in African children indicates the potential role of paediatric surveillance in predicting the emergence of norovirus strains with global epidemic potential.",

Yet no previous studies have directly examined the impact of prenatal and postnatal energetic environments on sex steroids in infancy, a critical period for hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis development. Thus, we examined the impact of maternal characteristics, birth size, and feeding practices on fecal sex steroid production in a longitudinal sample of 31 American infants followed from 2 weeks to 12 months of age. METHODS: Maternal characteristics and birth size were collected at study enrollment, infant diet was assessed through weekly 24-h food diaries, and anthropometrics were measured weekly. Fecal estradiol and testosterone levels were assessed weekly using validated microassay RIA techniques. Mixed models were used to test for associations between maternal and birth characteristics, feeding practices, and sex steroids across the first year of life. Formal mediation analysis examined whether the relationship between infant feeding and hormone levels was mediated by infant size. RESULTS: Maternal and birth characteristics had persistent effects on fecal sex steroid levels, with taller maternal height and larger birth size associated with lower estradiol levels in girls and higher testosterone levels in boys. Infant diet was also associated with sex steroid levels independently of infant size. Formula feeding was associated with higher estradiol levels in boys and girls and with higher testosterone in girls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that markers of early energy availability influence sex hormone levels with potential long-term consequences for reproductive development and function.",

OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the role of NoVs causing viremia in children hospitalized for AGE, as well as to correlate the presence of NoVs RNA in serum with clinical severity and stool viral load. STUDY DESIGN: Paired stool and serum samples were collected from 85 pediatric patients under 6 years hospitalized for AGE from March to September 2012 in Belem, Brazil. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to detect and quantify NoVs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 region was used to genotype the strains detected. RESULTS: NoVs were detected in 34.1% (29/85) of stool samples. By qRT-PCR, we found a high rate of NoVs' RNA in serum samples (34.5%) among NoVs-positive AGE cases, and was associated with a longer hospitalization (6.5 vs. 4.0 days; p=0.006), as well as with a higher stool viral load (3.9x10(11) vs. 1.1x10(11) GC/g; p=0.0472). NoVs strains were classified as GII.4 (90% of genotyped strains) and GII.7 (10%). The same genotype was found in paired stool and serum samples. CONCLUSION: Detection and molecular characterization of NoVs GII in paired stool and serum samples suggest that the dissemination of NoVs to the blood stream is not uncommon, but the role of viruses spread outside the gut and the relationship with disease severity need to be further addressed.",

METHODS: Cord, 24 hours' and 48 hours' total bilirubin levels were measured in 388 study infants. RESULTS: Infants born with cesarean section were fed later and more often had mixed feeding. First meconium passage was delayed with general anesthesia. Cord, 24 and 48 hours' bilirubin levels were not correlated with first feeding time, meconium passage time, mode of delivery, existence and type of anesthesia, and feeding modalities. Being in high intermediate risk zone at 72 hours of Bhutani's nomogram was only related to first feeding time and high cord bilirubin level. Late preterm infants were more frequently born with cesarean section and offered supplementary formula. Therefore, first meconium passage times and bilirubin levels were similar in the late preterm and term infants. CONCLUSIONS: Type of delivery or anesthesia, late prematurity, feeding modalities, and first meconium passage time were not related to early bilirubin levels in healthy neonates, but delayed first feeding and high cord bilirubin levels were related to be in higher risk zone for later hyperbilirubinemia.",

			"abstract": "The establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce. In this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including DGGE and the Human Intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons. Culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. Culture and HITChip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. Inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. Bacilli and other Firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while Proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples. Culture technique showed that Staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that Enterococcus, together with Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. In addition, HITChip results showed the prevalence of bacteria related to Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. This study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. Our findings indicate that the presence of Serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.",

			"abstract": "In the context of the possible introduction of a preventive vaccine against rotaviruses in Madagascar, the G and P genotypes distribution of the rotaviruses circulating in the children in Madagascar was studied, and the presence of emerging genotypes and unusual strains were assessed. From February 2008 to May 2009, 1,679 stools specimens were collected from children </=5 years old with diarrhea. ELISA was used for antigen detection, and molecular amplification of VP7 and VP4 gene fragments was used for genotyping. Rotavirus antigen was detected in 104 samples (6.2%). Partial sequences of VP7 and VP4 genes were obtained from 81 and 80 antigen-positive stools, respectively. The most frequent G and P types combinations detected were G9P[8] (n = 51; 64.6%), followed by G1P[8] (n = 15; 18.9%), and G1P[6] (n = 8; 10.1%). A few unusual G-P combinations, such as G4P[6] (n = 3; 3.8%), G9P[6] (n = 1; 1.3%), and G3P[9] reassortant feline human virus (n = 1; 1.3%) were identified. Both VP4 and VP7 sequences in one of the three G4P[6] isolates were closely related to those in porcine strains, and one was a reassortant human porcine virus. These findings give an overview of the strains circulating in Madagascar and should help public health authorities to define a vaccine strategy.",

			"abstract": "The frequencies of early childhood infections were studied in healthy children with increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes participating in the ongoing prospective high intensive infection follow-up Study, INDIS, started in 2009 in Turku, Finland. Here the results obtained from 160 stool to 160 nasal swab specimens collected in parallel at times of infectious symptoms in 2009-2010 from 45 children at the age of 24 months or younger are reported. The specimens were analyzed for enteric (human enterovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus, astrovirus) and respiratory RNA viruses (human enterovirus and rhinovirus) common in early childhood, respectively, using highly validated virus-specific real-time PCR methods. According to the results 96% of the children had at least one virus infection during the study period and one or several viral agents were detected in 76% of sample sets. The most prevalent viral agents were human rhinovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and norovirus (genotype GII) with positive specimens 57.5%, 28.8%, 19.4%, and 6.9%, respectively. Other intestinal viruses were found in less than 2% of stool specimens. Single infections covered 40.0% of the specimens while multiple infections with two or more infectious agents were detected in 36.3% of specimens and altogether 11 combinations of viruses were included in the mixed infections. Although human enterovirus is known to be a frequent finding in stool specimens, especially during early childhood, it was found in this study more frequently in nasal swab specimens. Whether this is true, more general, in countries with the high hygiene level remains to be shown.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Based on our findings in Yamagata, Japan, in 2008, we reported that human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) could be associated with epidemic myalgia among adults, although HPeV3 is generally associated with infectious diseases in children. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the relationship between community outbreaks among children and myalgia through the continued surveillance of HPeV3 infections. STUDY DESIGN: In the summer season (June-August) of 2011, we collected 586 specimens from children with infectious diseases, and throat swabs, and stool and serum specimens from 5 patients with myalgia. We detected HPeV3 using virus isolation and reverse-transcription PCR, and carried out phylogenetic analysis. We also performed screening for HPeV3 using 309 stocked frozen specimens collected in 2008 for a comparison between 2008 and 2011 strains. RESULTS: We detected HPeV3 in 59 children and isolated HPeV3 from all myalgia patients. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HPeV3 strains circulating in 2008 and 2011 could be clearly distinguished, apart from two strains. Further, we detected HPeV3 strains with identical nucleotide sequences from children and adults in 2008 and 2011, respectively. Two children belonging to one myalgia patient had upper respiratory infections prior to the onset of their father's illness, and the HPeV3 isolates from these three patients had identical nucleotide sequences. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that HPeV3, circulating among children in the community, infects their household, including parents, a portion of whom may subsequently show symptoms of myalgia. Our observations in 2008 and 2011 strongly suggest that clinical consideration should be given to HPeV3 in children as well as in adults during summer seasons in which an HPeV3 outbreak occurs among the children in the community.",

We aimed to systematically review randomized controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of prebiotic oligosaccharide supplementation in preterm infants </= 37 weeks of gestation. METHODS: Available studies from Medline, Embase, comparing formula milk supplemented with or without prebiotics, reporting on safety and the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), late onset sepsis, feed tolerance, physical growth and various stool characteristics were eligible. RESULTS: 7 trials (n = 417) were included. Five trials (n = 345) reported on the incidence of NEC, 3 trials (n = 295) reported on the incidence of late onset sepsis. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled RR (95% CI) of 1.24 (0.56-2.72) for NEC, 0.81 (0.57-1.15), p 0.23 for the risk of late onset sepsis. 3 individual trials (n = 295) did not observe any improvement in time to enteral feeds post intervention. Meta-analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in the growth of bifidobacteria in the oligosaccharide group with a weighted mean difference of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.73) *10(6) colonies/g, p < 0.00001. A reduction in stool viscosity and pH was also observed. None of the trials reported life threatening adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with prebiotic oligosaccharides was safe and did not result in decreased incidence of NEC, late onset sepsis and time to full enteral feeds but resulted in a significantly higher growth of beneficial microbes.",

Rhinoviruses are detected exceedingly in hospitalized cases of respiratory infection with varying severity, in addition to being frequent in cases of common cold. The aim of this study was to evaluate occurrence of HRV in a prospective study material. The prospective INDIS material comprises nasopharyngeal (N=429) and fecal (N=425) specimens from children under 11 years of age collected during any clinical infection. Validated real-time RT-PCR assays were applied for the detection of HRV. HRV were detected numerously not only in the nasopharyngeal specimens, but a myriad also in fecal specimens, 236 (55.0%) and 149 (35.1%), respectively, fecal findings actually beyond anticipation. A total of 13 of HRV-positive fecal specimens were selected for genetic typing in the VP4/VP2 coding region. HRV-A strains were detected in seven specimens: HRV-A9, -A10, -A24, -A49, -A56 and -A82. HRV-B-strains were detected three times: HRV-B42 and -B79, and HRV-C twice: HRV-C12 and HRV-Cpat4. HRV-B42 also showed cytopathic effect in cell culture, confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and VP4/VP2 sequencing, suggesting presence of viable HRV in fecal specimens.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although rotavirus and norovirus cause nearly 40% of severe endemic acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children <5 years of age in the United States, there are limited data on the etiologic role of other enteric viruses in this age group. METHODS: We conducted active population-based surveillance in children presenting with AGE to hospitals, emergency departments, and primary care clinics in 3 US counties. Stool specimens from these children and from age-matched healthy controls collected between October 2008 and September 2009 were tested for enteric adenovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, and aichivirus. Typing was performed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Adenovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, and aichivirus were detected in the stool specimens of 11.8%, 4.9%, 5.4%, 4.8%, 1.4%, and 0.2% of patients with AGE and 1.8%, 3.0%, 4.2%, 4.4%, 2.4%, and 0% of healthy controls, respectively. Adenovirus (type 41), astrovirus (types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8), sapovirus (genogroups I and II), parechovirus (types 1, 3, 4, and 5), and bocavirus (types 1, 2, and 3) were found cocirculating. CONCLUSIONS: Adenovirus, astrovirus, and sapovirus infections were detected in 22.1% of the specimens from children <5 years of age who had medical visits for AGE and tested negative for rotavirus and norovirus.

These systems are involved in various cellular regulatory processes (including stress response), and have not been previously investigated in Lactobacilli. We identified 6 putative TASs with toxins belonging to the MazE and RelE superfamilies (PemK1-capital A, Cyrillic1Lrh, PemK2-capital A, Cyrillic2Lrh, PemK3-RelB2Lrh, RelE1Lrh, RelB3-RelE3Lrh, and YefM-YoeBLrh) in the genomes of annotated strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. PCR analyses revealed that all systems were found in the genomes of 15 strains of L. rhamnosus isolated from humans in central Russia. These strains were highly heterogeneous with respect to the presence of TASs, as well as their nucleotide and amino acid sequences. In three cases, the relE1 genes contained IS3 elements. TAS heterogeneity may be used to reveal inter-genus differences between strains. Cloning of the toxin genes of 3 TASs inhibited Escherichia coli growth, thus confirming their functionality. Cell growth arrest caused by expression of the toxin genes could be reverted by the expression of a cognate antitoxins. Transcription of toxin-antitoxin loci in L. rhamnosus was shown by RT-PCR.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: To provide information for umbilical cord blood (UCB) banks to adopt optimal collection strategies and to make UCB banks operate efficiently, we investigated the reasons for exclusion of UCB units in a 3-year recruitment period. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed records of the reasons for exclusion of the potential UCB donation from 2004 to 2006 in the Tzu-Chi Cord Blood Bank and compared the results over 3 years. We grouped these reasons for exclusion into five phases, before collection, during delivery, before processing, during processing, and after freezing according to the time sequence and analyzed the reasons at each phase. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2006, there were 10,685 deliveries with the intention of UCB donation. In total, 41.2% of the UCB units were considered eligible for transplantation. The exclusion rates were 93.1, 48.4, and 54.1% in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. We excluded 612 donations from women before their child birth, 133 UCB units during delivery, 80 units before processing, 5010 units during processing, and 421 units after freezing. There were 24 UCB units with unknown reasons of ineligibility. Low UCB weight and low cell count were the first two leading causes of exclusion (48.6 and 30.9%). The prevalence of artificial errors, holiday or transportation problem, low weight, and infant problems decreased year after year. CONCLUSION: The exclusion rate was high at the beginning of our study as in previous studies. Understanding the reasons for UCB exclusion may help to improve the efficiency of UCB banking programs in the future.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: A quasi-experimental study was conducted to determine whether or not a protected water supply (bottled drinking water) could prevent or delay cryptosporidial infections among children residing in an endemic community. METHODS: A total of 176 children residing in a semiurban slum area in southern India were enrolled preweaning and received either bottled (n = 90) or municipal (n = 86) drinking water based on residence in specific streets. Weekly surveillance visits were conducted until children reached their second birthday. Stool samples were collected every month and during diarrheal episodes, and were tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium species by polymerase chain reaction. Differences in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis between bottled and municipal water groups were compared using Poisson survival models, and a propensity score model was developed to adjust for the effect of potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 186 episodes of cryptosporidiosis, mostly asymptomatic, were observed in 118 (67%) children during the follow-up period at a rate of 0.59 episodes per child-year. Diarrhea associated with Cryptosporidium species tended to be longer in duration and more severe. Stunting at 6 months was associated with a higher risk of cryptosporidiosis (rate ratio [RR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.91). A higher gastrointestinal disease burden was also seen in children with cryptosporidiosis. Drinking bottled water was not associated with a reduced risk of cryptosporidiosis (adjusted RR = 0.86; 95% CI, .60-1.23). CONCLUSIONS: This study documented a high burden of cryptosporidiosis among children in an endemic Indian slum community. The lack of association between drinking bottled water and cryptosporidiosis suggests possible spread from asymptomatically infected individuals involving multiple transmission pathways.",

Our ability to predict which fetuses will require postnatal surgery is limited. The aim of our study is to correlate iAC and associated US findings with postnatal outcome. METHODS: A single centre retrospective review of all cases of fetal iAC diagnosed between 2004 and 2010 was performed. Maternal demographics, fetal US findings, and outcomes (need for surgery and mortality) were collected. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three cases of iAC were identified. There were no cases of fetal demise or postnatal deaths. Three liveborns (13%) required abdominal surgery at a median of 2 days (0-3) for intestinal atresia. US findings of iAC and dilated bowel with (p=0.008) or without (p=0.005) polyhydramnios predicted a need for postnatal surgery as did the combination of iAC, polyhydramnios, and ascites (p=0.008). Conversely, iAC alone or associated with oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, ascites, or growth restriction did not predict need for postnatal surgery. CONCLUSION: The majority of fetuses with iAC on prenatal US do not require surgery. Associated US findings (bowel dilation) can be used to select fetuses for delivery in neonatal surgical centres.",

We sought to determine risk factors for the onset of bronchiectasis, using data collected by the Australian Respiratory Early Surveillance Team for Cystic Fibrosis (AREST CF) intensive surveillance program. METHODS: We examined data from 127 consecutive infants who received a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis after newborn screening. Chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, while the children were in stable clinical condition, at 3 months and 1, 2, and 3 years of age. Longitudinal data were used to determine risk factors associated with the detection of bronchiectasis from 3 months to 3 years of age. RESULTS: The point prevalence of bronchiectasis at each visit increased from 29.3% at 3 months of age to 61.5% at 3 years of age. In multivariate analyses, risk factors for bronchiectasis were presentation with meconium ileus (odds ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51 to 6.66; P=0.002), respiratory symptoms at the time of CT and BAL (odds ratio, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.14; P=0.008), free neutrophil elastase activity in BAL fluid (odds ratio, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.70 to 5.35; P<0.001), and gas trapping on expiratory CT (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.59; P=0.01). Free neutrophil elastase activity in BAL fluid at 3 months of age was associated with persistent bronchiectasis (present on two or more sequential scans), with the odds seven times as high at 12 months of age and four times as high at 3 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil elastase activity in BAL fluid in early life was associated with early bronchiectasis in children with cystic fibrosis.

			"abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) pigs develop disease with features remarkably similar to those in people with CF, including exocrine pancreatic destruction, focal biliary cirrhosis, micro-gallbladder, vas deferens loss, airway disease, and meconium ileus. Whereas meconium ileus occurs in 15% of babies with CF, the penetrance is 100% in newborn CF pigs. We hypothesized that transgenic expression of porcine CF transmembrane conductance regulator (pCFTR) cDNA under control of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP) promoter would alleviate the meconium ileus. We produced 5 CFTR-/-;TgFABP>pCFTR lines. In 3 lines, intestinal expression of CFTR at least partially restored CFTR-mediated anion transport and improved the intestinal phenotype. In contrast, these pigs still had pancreatic destruction, liver disease, and reduced weight gain, and within weeks of birth, they developed sinus and lung disease, the severity of which varied over time. These data indicate that expressing CFTR in intestine without pancreatic or hepatic correction is sufficient to rescue meconium ileus. Comparing CFTR expression in different lines revealed that approximately 20% of wild-type CFTR mRNA largely prevented meconium ileus. This model may be of value for understanding CF pathophysiology and testing new preventions and therapies.",

To address this, pilot studies have been conducted to standardize and enhance both biospecimen collection and sample obtainment in terms of autoantibody collection, stool sample preservation, RNA, biomarker stability, metabolic biomarkers and T-cell viability. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young is a multicentre, international prospective study (n = 8677) designed to identify environmental triggers of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in genetically at-risk children from ages 3 months until 15 years. The study is conducted through six primary clinical centres located in four countries. RESULTS: As of May 2012, over three million biological samples and 250 million total data points have been collected, which will be analysed to assess autoimmunity status, presence of inflammatory biomarkers, genetic factors, exposure to infectious agents, dietary biomarkers and other potentially important environmental exposures in relation to autoimmunity and progression to T1D. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed procedures were utilized to standardize both data harmonization and management when handling a large quantity of longitudinal samples obtained from multiple locations. In addition, a description of the available specimens is provided that serve as an invaluable repository for the elucidation of determinants in T1D focusing on autoantibody concordance and harmonization, transglutaminase autoantibody, inflammatory biomarkers (T-cells), genetic proficiency testing, RNA lab internal quality control testing, infectious agents (monitoring cross-contamination, virus preservation and nasal swab collection validity) and HbA1c testing.",

Identifying modifiable factors associated with early rapid weight gain is a prerequisite for curtailing the growing worldwide obesity epidemic. Recently, much attention has been given to findings indicating that gut microbiota may play a role in obesity development. We aim at identifying how the development of early gut microbiota is associated with expected infant growth. We developed a novel procedure that allows for the identification of longitudinal gut microbiota patterns (corresponding to the gut ecosystem developing), which are associated with an outcome of interest, while appropriately controlling for the false discovery rate. Our method identified developmental pathways of Staphylococcus species and Escherichia coli that were associated with expected growth, and traditional methods indicated that the detection of Bacteroides species at day 30 was associated with growth. Our method should have wide future applicability for studying gut microbiota, and is particularly important for translational considerations, as it is critical to understand the timing of microbiome transitions prior to attempting to manipulate gut microbiota in early life.",

			"abstract": "There is a growing concern about the potential health effects of exposure to various environmental chemicals during pregnancy and infancy. The placenta is expected to be an effective barrier protecting the developing embryo against some endocrine disruptors (EDs) circulating in maternal blood. The current study was designed to assess in utero exposure levels of non-persistent organic pollutants (non-POPs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Chinese newborns and potential role of placenta barrier against fetal exposure to these commonly-used environmental endocrine disruptors. A total of 230 newborn-mother pairs were enrolled during 2010-2011, 201 pairs of which were recruited from Shanghai, and the other 29 pairs came from Wenzhou. Maternal blood, cord blood, and meconium specimens were collected in the subject population from Shanghai and analyzed for non-POPs, including mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP). A total of 19 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) congeners, which belong to POPs, were detected in maternal and cord blood specimens from the other 29 pairs. Fetal-maternal ratios (F-M ratios) and regression coefficients were presented to assess potential function of placenta on barricading the mother/fetal transfer of these EDs. Concentrations of the detected non-POPs in cord blood samples were approximately 20% lower than those in maternal blood, and regression coefficients of which were all over 0.80. In contrast, PBDEs levels in cord blood samples were significantly higher than those in maternal blood. MEHP levels in meconium were much higher than those in cord blood samples, and highly correlated. Therefore, observations demonstrated that the placental barrier slightly decreased the fetal exposure to most non-POPs, while PBDEs seemed to be totally transferred across the placenta and finally reached the fetus. For in utero exposure assessment of Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), MEHP level in meconium may be a useful biomarker.",

			"abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low birth weight infants. Although decades of research point to a role for gut bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disease, the exact relationship between microbes and NEC has not been elucidated. In this review, we describe recent advances in the use of molecular methods to compare gut bacteria in infants with and without NEC. RECENT FINDINGS: Our understanding of how bacteria contribute to NEC pathogenesis has been limited by the use of traditional, culture-based investigations. Recent advances in microbial ecology and DNA sequencing have made it possible to comprehensively study gut bacterial populations and to understand their physiologic importance. Several studies have identified differences in the microbiota among infants with and without NEC, but the findings have often varied across studies. SUMMARY: To date, no single change in the gut microbiota has definitively been identified as a risk factor or cause of NEC. The findings at present suggest that NEC does not result from growth of a single causative pathogen, but rather that the disease results from a generalized disturbance of normal colonization patterns in the developing gut.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral cavity has been proposed as an important reservoir of H.pylori, being implicated in bacterial transmission through oral-oral route. However, some investigators believe that the newborn acquires H.pylori from mother through vaginal delivery. In this study, oral and vaginal yeasts were examined for the intracellular occurrence of H.pylori and their possible role in bacterial transmission.  METHODS: Sixty nine oral and vaginal yeasts from expecting mothers (39 oral and 30 vaginal) and seven oral yeasts from neonates(6/46 vaginal delivery, 1/43 cesarean) were identified and studied by light and fluorescent microscopy for observing the intracellular bacterium-like bodies(BLBs). Whole DNAs of yeasts were recruited for detection of H.pylori-specific genes. Urea breath test (UBT) was performed for detection of H.pylori infection in mothers. Stool antigen test (SAT) was used for detection of H.pylori antigens in infants' stool at birth and six months of age.  RESULTS: Oral yeasts were isolated more frequently from normally-delivered neonates. The frequency of H.pylori genes in mothers' vaginal yeasts was significantly higher than in mothers' oral yeasts. A significant correlation was found between the occurrence of H.pylori genes in vaginal yeasts and that in neonates' oral yeasts, occurrence of H.pylori genes in mothers' vaginal yeasts or neonates' oral yeasts, and UBT+ results in mothers. CONCLUSION: C.albicans which colonizes the oral cavity of neonates through vaginal delivery or contact with environment or healthcare workers could be an important reservoir of H.pylori. Vaginal yeasts are more potent in accommodating H.pylori than oral yeasts. Accordingly, vaginal yeast is proposed as the primary reservoir of H.pylori which facilitates H.pylori transmission to neonates.",

The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G antibodies against the GI-4, GII-3, and GII-4 NoV genotypes was 84.1%, 76.3%, and 94.5%, respectively. A rapid decrease in seroprevalence occurred after birth, with the lowest levels observed in the <23-month age group, and a steep increase in seroprevalence occurred in early childhood, reaching 60.5% for GI-4, 65.1% for GII-3, and 90.7% for GII-4 at age 2-5 years, and over 80% for all three genotypes in subjects aged 20 years or older.

			"abstract": "Since 2004, efforts to improve poliovirus detection have significantly increased the volume of specimen testing from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) patients in India. One option to decrease collection and testing burden would be collecting only a single stool specimen instead of two. We investigated stool specimen sensitivity for poliovirus detection in India to estimate the contribution of the second specimen. We reviewed poliovirus isolation data for 303984 children aged <15 years with AFP during 2000-2010. Using maximum-likelihood estimation, we determined specimen sensitivity of each stool specimen, combined sensitivity of both specimens, and sensitivity added by the second specimen. Of 5184 AFP patients with poliovirus isolates, 382 (7.4%) were identified only by the second specimen. Sensitivity was 91.4% for the first specimen and 84.5% for the second specimen; the second specimen added 7.3% sensitivity, giving a combined sensitivity of 98.7%. Combined sensitivity declined, and added sensitivity increased, as the time from paralysis onset to stool collection increased (P = 0.032). The sensitivity added by the second specimen is important to detect the last chains of poliovirus transmission and to achieve certification of polio eradication. For sensitive surveillance, two stool specimens should continue to be collected from each AFP patient in India.",

Mann-Whitney test was used for analysis of binary data and continuous variables were analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Mean cord blood levels of FVIII:C, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, FIX, FXI, FXII and plasminogen were significantly higher in babies delivered after labour, compared to those delivered after an elective caesarean.

However, comparatively few studies have determined the epidemiological features of campylobacteriosis in resource-poor settings. METHODS: A total of 1,941 faecal specimens collected from symptomatic (diarrhoeic) children and 507 specimens from asymptomatic (non-diarrhoeic) children hospitalised in Blantyre, Malawi, between 1997 and 2007, and previously tested for the presence of rotavirus and norovirus, was analysed for C. jejuni and C. coli using a real time PCR assay. RESULTS: Campylobacter species were detected in 415/1,941 (21%) of diarrhoeic children, with C. jejuni accounting for 85% of all cases. The median age of children with Campylobacter infection was 11 months (range 0.1-55 months), and was significantly higher than that for children with rotavirus and norovirus (6 months and 7 months respectively; P<0.001). Co-infection with either rotavirus or norovirus was noted in 41% of all cases in the diarrhoeic group. In contrast, the detection rate of Campylobacter in the non-diarrhoeic group was 14%, with viral co-infection identified in 16% of children with Campylobacter. There was no association between Campylobacter detection rate and season over the 10 year period. DISCUSSION: Using molecular detection methodology in hospitalised Malawian children, we have demonstrated a high prevalence of Campylobacter infection, with frequent viral co-infection.

METHODS: This prospective study included 46 VLBW infants with intestinal distress and 49 reference patients. Meconium and stool samples were collected prospectively on alternate days for 4 weeks, and fecal S100A12 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Gestational age and weight at birth were significantly lower in patients with intestinal distress when compared to unaffected reference infants. Median levels of fecal S100A12 were significantly higher in patients with intestinal distress at onset of disease and before compared with unaffected reference infants. Median levels of fecal S100A12 declined steadily to baseline levels within 2 weeks after disease onset. The ideal cutoff value for identifying patients with intestinal distress within 7 days before disease onset was 60 mug/kg (sensitivity 0.73; specificity 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Fecal S100A12 levels are increased in VLBW infants with intestinal distress; however, the potential for S100A12 as an early biomarker is largely limited by overlaps between values of infants with intestinal distress and the reference population.",

This study investigated the bacterial and viral etiology and related clinical and epidemiological factors in children with acute diarrhea in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. METHODS: Stool specimens were collected from 283 children under 5 years of age visiting hospital due to acute diarrhea and from 60 healthy controls of similar age. Pathogens were investigated by using conventional culture techniques, PCR and immunochromatographic testing. Salmonella and Shigella strains were serotyped and their susceptibility to 23 antimicrobial agents was determined by the agar dilution method. RESULTS: At least one pathogen was detected in 64% of the 283 patients and in 8% of the 60 controls (p < 0.001). Rotavirus was found in 30% of the patients, followed by diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (24%), Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica (9%), Shigella spp. (6%), adenovirus (5%) and Campylobacter spp. (2%). Multiple pathogens were found in 11% of the patients and in 2% of the controls (p = 0.028). Viruses were found mainly in children of </= 2 years of age, whereas bacteria were equally prevalent among all the age groups. Viral infections occurred mostly during the cool dry season and the bacterial infections during the rainy season. Fever (64%) and vomiting (61%) were the most common symptoms associated with diarrhea. Only one Salmonella strain was resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Of the Shigella strains, one was resistant to nalidixic acid but 81% to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, 63% to streptomycin and 50% to ampicillin. Most of all the other Salmonella and Shigella strains were sensitive to all antimicrobials tested. CONCLUSION: Rotaviruses and diarrheal E. coli were the most predominant pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in Burkinabe children. Constant antimicrobial surveillance is warranted to observe for the emergence of enteric bacteria resistant to antimicrobials that are important in treatment also of severe infections.",

Infant formulas try to mimic the bifidogenic effect of human milk using prebiotic supplementation. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of a 0.8 g/dL Orafti((R))Synergy1 (oligofructose-enriched inulin) supplemented infant formula during the first 4 months of life. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled and parallel trial, formula fed healthy term newborns were randomized to receive a control (controls) or SYN1 supplemented infant formula (SYN1). Breastfed newborns (BF) were also followed for comparison. Anthropometry, water balance, blood parameters, adverse events, stool frequency and characteristics and faecal microbiota were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 252 formula fed infants were randomized at birth (n = 124 controls, n = 128 SYN1) and 131 BF infants were recruited; after 4 months 68 controls, 63 SYN1 and 57 BF completed the study. SYN1 infants showed a microbiota composition closer to that of BF infants, with a trend towards higher Bifidobacterium cell counts, softer stools and a higher deposition frequency compared to controls. There were no differences between formulas in anthropometry and relevant adverse events, water balance or blood parameters. CONCLUSION: A 0.8 g/dL SYN1-supplemented infant formula during the first 4 months of life is safe and effective, promoting a gut microbiota closer to that of breastfeeding.

RESULTS: Rotavirus, which circulated throughout the year, was detected in 220/720 (31%) children. Over 85% of patients with rotavirus gastro-enteritis were <1 year of age. A total of 13 rotavirus G/P types were identified, the most common strains being G1P[8] (39.5%), G12P[6] (23.2%), G2P[4] (9.5%), G9P[8] (6.8%) and G8P[4] (6.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm the importance of rotavirus infection in young Malawian children and highlight the continuing diversity of circulating rotavirus strains in Blantyre. Together with previous observations, the findings contribute to a baseline of data against which the impact of future rotavirus vaccination in Malawi can be assessed.",

Maternal vaginas harbored all four tet resistance genes, but most commonly tet(M) and tet(O) (63 and 38 %, respectively). Genes coding for tet resistance differed by birth mode, with 50 % of vaginally delivered babies had tet(M) and tet(O) and 16 and 13 % of infants born by C-section had tet(O) and tet(W), respectively. Newborns acquire antibiotic resistance genes at birth, and the resistance gene profile varies by mode of delivery.",

Many arrive with patent intestinal parasitic infections, and recent analyses have indicated consistently rising trends in the prevalence of some infections. Here, we examined 18,563 hospital records of subjects in Qatar seeking medical assistance for a variety of ailments, combining data from 2009 to 2011 with the earlier dataset from 2005 to 2008 to enable trends to be identified across a 7-year period. We found that 8.6% were infected with one or more species of parasites, however in contrast to the earlier period (2005-2008), in the latter 3 years there were falling trends of prevalence providing some optimism that parasitic infections among the resident immigrants have begun to decline. We identified also geographic regions from which resident workers still maintain a relatively high prevalence of helminth infections despite their long-term residence in Qatar.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the global microbial composition, using large-scale DNA sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes, in faecal samples from colicky infants given L. reuteri DSM 17938 or placebo. METHODS: Twenty-nine colicky infants (age 10-60 days) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Lactobacillus reuteri (10(8) cfu) or a placebo once daily for 21 days. Responders were defined as subjects with a decrease of 50% in daily crying time at day 21 compared with the starting point. The microbiota of faecal samples from day 1 and 21 were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing. The primers: Bakt_341F and Bakt_805R, complemented with 454 adapters and sample specific barcodes were used for PCR amplification of the 16 S rRNA genes. The structure of the data was explored by using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and effects of different variables were visualized with ordination analysis. RESULTS: The infants' faecal microbiota were composed of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes as the four main phyla. The composition of the microbiota in infants with colic had very high inter-individual variability with Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios varying from 4000 to 0.025. On an individual basis, the microbiota was, however, relatively stable over time. Treatment with L. reuteri DSM 17938 did not change the global composition of the microbiota, but when comparing responders with non-responders the group responders had an increased relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes and genus Bacteroides at day 21 compared with day 0. Furthermore, the phyla composition of the infants at day 21 could be divided into three enterotype groups, dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, respectively. CONCLUSION: L. reuteri DSM 17938 did not affect the global composition of the microbiota. However, the increase of Bacteroidetes in the responder infants indicated that a decrease in colicky symptoms was linked to changes of the microbiota.

			"abstract": "Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), though non-nutritive to the infant, shape the intestinal microbiota and protect against pathogens during early growth and development. Infant formulas with added galacto-oligosaccharides have been developed to mimic the beneficial effects of HMOs. Premature infants have an immature immune system and a leaky gut and are thus highly susceptible to opportunistic infections. A method employing nanoflow liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) is presented to simultaneously identify and quantify HMOs in the feces and urine of infants, of which 75 HMOs have previously been fully structurally elucidated. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS was employed for high-resolution and rapid compositional profiling. To demonstrate this novel method, samples from mother-infant dyads as well as samples from infants receiving infant formula fortified with dietary galacto-oligosaccharides or probiotic bifidobacteria were analyzed. Ingested oligosaccharides are demonstrated in high abundance in the infant feces and urine. While the method was developed to examine specimens from preterm infants, it is of general utility and can be used to monitor oligosaccharide consumption and utilization in term infants, children, and adults. This method may therefore provide diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.",

			"abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast milk as the gold standard. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences was used in the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 Australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. Beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and Lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. The Lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (Ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. Bifidobacteriaceae were abundant in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. A semiquantitative PCR method was devised to differentiate between B. longum subsp. longum and B. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. B. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. The presence of B. bifidum in the stools of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of Bifidobacteriaceae. When Bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, Lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. New information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.",

			"abstract": "Calprotectin (CP) is a calcium-binding cytosolic neutrophil protein and the concentration in feces reflects the migration of neutrophils into the gut lumen. Testing for fecal CP (f-CP) in patients with negative cultures for enteric pathogens is widely accepted as a useful screening tool for identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from endoscopy for suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with the assumption that a negative f-CP is compatible with a functional disorder. Campylobacter concisus has recently been reported to have a high incidence in the Danish population almost equal to Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli and has been reported to cause prolonged watery diarrhea. However, isolation of C. concisus from feces requires the filter method in a hydrogen-enriched microaerobic atmosphere, which is not commonly used in the laboratory, and the diagnosis may consequently be missed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the f-CP levels, as a marker for the intestinal inflammation in C. jejuni/coli- and C. concisus-infected patients. The authors found a high concentration of f-CP (median 631: IQR 221-1274) among 140 patients with C. jejuni/coli infection, whereas the f-CP level among 99 C. concisus-infected patients was significantly lower (median 53: IQR 20-169). The data correlate to the severe inflammatory gastroenteritis seen in patients infected with C. jejuni/coli, whereas C. concisus-infected patients have a much lower intestinal inflammation which could be compared with viral gastroenteritis. Nevertheless, clinicians should be aware of C. concisus infection, especially in patients with prolonged mild diarrhea, in the differential diagnosis to IBD.",

Children aged <5 years attending outpatient clinics for diarrhoea were matched by age and sex with controls. Data were collected on family demographics, socioeconomic indicators, and risk behaviour practices. Two rectal swabs and a stool specimen were collected from cases and controls. Samples were cultured for bacterial pathogens using standard techniques and tested by ELISA to detect rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. Four hundred cases and controls were enrolled between 2007 and 2009. The strongest independent risk factors for diarrhoea were: presence of another household member with diarrhoea [matched odds ratio (mOR) 4.9, 95% CI 2.8-8.4] in the week preceding the survey, introduction to a new kind of food (mOR 3, 95% CI 1.7-5.4), and the child being cared for outside home (mOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.2). While these risk factors are not identifiable, in some age groups more easily modifiable risk factors were identified including: having no soap for handwashing (mOR 6.3, 95% CI 1.2-33.9) for children aged 7-12 months, and pacifier use (mOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.5) in children aged 0-6 months. In total, the findings of this study suggest that community-based interventions to improve practices related to sanitation and hygiene, handwashing and food could be utilized to reduce the burden of diarrhoea in Egyptian children aged <5 years.",

HBoV-1 genome was detected in 10.6% of stools with frequent association with rotavirus and norovirus. The median of HBoV-1 viral load was 1.88 x 104 genome/ml, lower than previously shown in secretions of patients with respiratory infections, without any obvious association between high viral load and presence of HBoV as single agent. Thus, although HBoV-1 was frequently detected in these patients, there is no clear causal association of this agent with diarrhoea. Indeed, HBoV-1 DNA in stools of patients with gastroenteritis without respiratory symptoms may be a remnant of previous infections or associated with prolonged shedding of virus in the respiratory or digestive tracts.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological information on the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in different regions is a prerequisite to develop appropriate control strategies. Therefore, this present study was conducted to assess the magnitude and pattern of intestinal parasitism in highland and lowland dwellers in Gamo area, South Ethiopia. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2010 and July 2011 at Lante, Kolla Shelle, Dorze and Geressie kebeles of Gamo Gofa Zone, South Ethiopia. The study sites and study participants were selected using multistage sampling method. Data were gathered through house-to-house survey. A total of 858 stool specimens were collected and processed using direct wet mount and formol-ether concentration techniques for the presence of parasite. RESULTS: Out of the total examined subjects, 342(39.9%) were found positive for at least one intestinal parasite. The prevalence of Entamoeba histolytica/dispar was the highest 98(11.4%), followed by Giardia lamblia 91(10.6%), Ascaris lumbricoides 67(7.8%), Strongyloides stercoralis 51(5.9%), hookworm 42(4.9%), Trichuris trichiura 24(2.8%), Taenia species 18(2.1%), Hymenolepis nana 7(0.6%) and Schistosoma mansoni 1(0.12%). No statistically significant difference was observed in the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among lowland (37.9%) and highland dwellers (42.3%) (P = 0.185). The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was not significantly different among the study sites but it was relatively higher in Geressie (42.8%) than other kebeles. Sex was not associated with parasitic infections (P = 0.481). No statistically significant difference of infection was observed among the age groups (P = 0.228) but it was higher in reproductive age group. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among the lowland and highland dwellers in Gamo area indicated that parasitic infections are important public health problems. Thus, infection control measures and the development of awareness strategies to improve sanitation and health education should be considered.",

Controls were matched prospectively by gestational and postnatal age and type of feeding. Gut microbiota composition was analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the presence of enteric viruses in the stools was assayed by PCR and by reverse transcription reaction followed by PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The symptom was transient, benign and self-limiting and none of the background factors explained it. No enteric viruses were detected, and the bacterial analyses showed no statistically significant differences between the infants with or without gross blood in stools. The characterization of the gut microbiota revealed low bacterial diversity.

The reported beneficial effects of the use of probiotics to complement antibiotic therapy or prevent diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection in infants have increased in recent years. In the present study, we demonstrated the capacity of supernatants obtained from three novel probiotics (Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-4034, Bifidobacterium breve CNCM I-4035 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-4036) isolated from the faeces of breastfed infants to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic (EPEC) bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella. To assess their potential antimicrobial activity, the 17 and 24 h cell-free supernatants broth concentrates (10x) having 1, 2 or 4 % of the three probiotics were incubated with EPEC bacteria strains. After 17 h of co-culture, the supernatants were able to inhibit the growth of E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella up to 40, 55 and 81 %, respectively. However, the inhibitory capacity of some supernatants was maintained or completely lost when the supernatants (pH 3.0) were neutralised (pH 6.5). Overall, these results demonstrated that L. paracasei CNCM I-4034, B. breve CNCM I-4035 and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036 produce compounds that exhibited strain-specific inhibition of enterobacteria and have the potential to be used as probiotics in functional foods.",

			"abstract": "The aim of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterise novel strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria with probiotic properties from the faeces of exclusively breast-fed infants. Of the 4680 isolated colonies, 758 exhibited resistance to low pH and tolerance to high concentrations of bile salts; of these, only forty-two exhibited a strong ability to adhere to enterocytes in vitro. The identities of the isolates were confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, which permitted the grouping of the forty-two bacteria into three different strains that showed more than 99 % sequence identity with Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium breve, respectively. The strain identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions. Strains were assayed for enzymatic activity and carbohydrate utilisation, and they were deposited in the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes (CNCM) of the Institute Pasteur and named L. paracasei CNCM I-4034, B. breve CNCM I-4035 and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036. The strains were susceptible to antibiotics and did not produce undesirable metabolites, and their safety was assessed by acute ingestion in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed BALB/c mouse models. The three novel strains inhibited in vitro the meningitis aetiological agent Listeria monocytogenes and human rotavirus infections. B. breve CNCM I-4035 led to a higher IgA concentration in faeces and plasma of mice. Overall, these results suggest that L. paracasei CNCM I-4034, B. breve CNCM I-4035 and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036 should be considered as probiotic strains, and their human health benefits should be further evaluated.",

			"abstract": "The composition of the microbiota associated with the human ileum and colon in the early weeks of life of two preterm infants was examined, with particular emphasis on the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium members. Culturing work showed that bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the ileostomy changed over time, compared with the colostomy effluent where there was far less variation. The colostomy infant was dominated by two phyla, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, while in the ileostomy samples, Proteobacteria emerged at the expense of Actinobacteria. Bacteroidetes were only detected following the reversal of the ileostomy in the final fecal sample and were not detected in any colonic fluid samples. Clostridia levels were unstable in the colostomy fluid, suggesting that the ileostomy/colostomy itself influenced the gut microbiota, in particular the strict anaerobes. Pyrosequencing analysis of microbiota composition indicated that bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are among the dominant genera in both the ileal and colonic fluids. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli levels were unstable in the ileostomy fluid, with large reductions in numbers and relative proportions of both observed. These decreases were characterized by an increase in proportions of Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. Clostridium was detected only in the colonic effluent, with large changes in the relative proportions over time.",

			"abstract": "Late onset sepsis (LOS) is a major contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially in premature infants. Distortions in the establishment of normal gut microbiota, commensal microbes that colonize the digestive tract, might increase the risk of LOS via disruption of the mucosal barrier with resultant translocation of luminal contents. Correlation of distortions of the intestinal microbiota with LOS is a necessary first step to design novel microbiota-based screening approaches that might lead to early interventions to prevent LOS in high risk infants. Using a case/control design nested in a cohort study of preterm infants, we analyzed stool samples that had been prospectively collected from ten preterm infants with LOS and from 18 matched controls. A 16S rRNA based approach was utilized to compare microbiota diversity and identify specific bacterial signatures that differed in their prevalence between cases and controls. Overall alpha-diversity (Chao1) was lower in cases two weeks before (p<0.05) but not one week before or at the time of diagnosis of LOS. Overall microbiota structure (Unifrac) appeared distinct in cases 2 weeks and 1 week before but not at diagnosis (p<0.05). Although we detected few operational taxonomic units (OTUs) unique or enriched in cases, we found many OTUs common in controls that were lacking in cases (p<0.01). Bifidobacteria counts were lower in cases at all time points. Our results support the hypothesis that a distortion in normal microbiota composition, and not an enrichment of potential pathogens, is associated with LOS in preterm infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Culture-dependent methods have shown that meconium, the newborn's first intestinal discharge, is not sterile, but the diversity of bacteria present in this material needs to be further characterized by means of more sensitive molecular techniques. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to characterize molecularly the meconium microbiota in term infants, to assess whether it contributes to the future microbiota of the infants' gastrointestinal tract, and to evaluate how it relates to lifestyle variables and atopy-related conditions. METHODS: We applied high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to study the meconium microbiota in twenty term newborns from a Spanish birth cohort. For comparison, we characterized the microbiota in fecal samples from seven pregnant women days before delivery and in two series of infant samples spanning the first seven months of life. We also compared our data with vaginal and skin microbiota characterized in independent studies. Different types of meconium microbiota were defined based on taxonomic composition and abundance and their associations with different factors were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The meconium microbiota differs from those in adult feces, vagina and skin, but resembles that of fecal samples from young infants. Meconium samples clustered into two types with different bacterial diversity, richness and composition. One of the types was less diverse, dominated by enteric bacteria and associated with a history of atopic eczema in the mother (P = 0.038), whereas the second type was dominated by lactic acid bacteria and associated with respiratory problems in the infant (P = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS & CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that the meconium microbiota has an intrauterine origin and participates in gut colonization. Although based on a small population sample, our association analyses also suggest that the type of bacteria detected in meconium is influenced by maternal factors and may have consequences for childhood health.",

METHODOLOGY: In this case-control study,  enrolled children < 3 years old with ISS (confirmed radiologically and/or surgically) were  matched by age and gender to controls admitted with acute non-abdominal surgical illnesses. Stool samples were collected and tested for various enteric bacteria, rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses (EA, 40 and 41) and astroviruses using commercially available ELISA diagnostic kits. RESULTS: From December 2004 to May 2009, 158 cases and 425 matched controls were enrolled. A history of diarrhoea and cough over the preceding four weeks of interview were more common in cases than controls, respectively. Children with mothers who had secondary education and above were 2.2 times more likely to have ISS than those whose mothers had a lower level of education. In spite of the low detection rate of EA infection (regardless of diarrhoea history) and asymptomatic rotavirus infection, they were detected in higher frequencies in cases than controls; however, infection with astrovirus and bacterial pathogens did not appear to be associated with increased risk of ISS. CONCLUSIONS: History of diarrhoea and cough over the four weeks preceding the study and maternal education above secondary level were potential risk factors for ISS. EA and asymptomatic rotavirus infection were detected in higher frequencies among cases than controls; however, association with ISS cannot be confirmed. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the pathogenesis which may link such infections with ISS.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive analysis of the fecal microbiota in infants with colic, as compared with control infants, during their first 100 days of life. METHODS: Microbial DNA of >200 samples from 12 infants with colic and 12 age-matched control infants was extracted and hybridized to a phylogenetic microarray. RESULTS: Microbiota diversity gradually increased after birth only in the control group; moreover, in the first weeks, the diversity of the colic group was significantly lower than that of the control group. The stability of the successive samples also appeared to be significantly lower in the infants with colic for the first weeks. Further analyses revealed which bacterial groups were responsible for colic-related differences in microbiota at age 1 or 2 weeks, the earliest ages with significant differences. Proteobacteria were significantly increased in infants with colic compared with control infants, with a relative abundance that was more than twofold. In contrast, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were significantly reduced in infants with colic. Moreover, the colic phenotype correlated positively with specific groups of proteobacteria, including bacteria related to Escherichia, Klebsiella, Serratia, Vibrio, Yersinia, and Pseudomonas, but negatively with bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, the latter of which includes some lactobacilli and canonical groups known to produce butyrate and lactate. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the presence of microbial signatures in the first weeks of life in infants who later develop colic. These microbial signatures may be used to understand the excessive crying. The results offer opportunities for early diagnostics as well as for developing specific therapies.",

			"abstract": "The zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium was studied in one of the most densely populated provinces of Egypt regarding livestock and people. In a representative survey, faecal samples from cattle, buffalo and stool samples from diarrhoeic children (<10 years) were investigated. Parameters assumed to be related to cryptosporidiosis were recorded for animals and children. Animal samples (804) were examined by the Copro-antigen RIDA((R))QUICK test, followed by PCRs targeting the 18S rDNA and gp60 genes for antigen-positive and 10% randomly selected negative samples. All 165 human samples were tested by both methods. The overall estimated prevalence of Cryptosporidium in ruminants was 32.2%, without significant difference between animal species. PCR identified 65.7% Cryptosporidium parvum, 11.8% Cryptosporidium ryanae, 4.1% Cryptosporidium bovis, and combinations of C. parvum plus C. ryanae (11.2%), C. parvum plus C. bovis (5.3%) and of C. parvum plus Cryptosporidium andersoni (1.8%), also without significant differences in species occurrence between cattle and buffalos. The human Cryptosporidium spp. prevalence was 49.1%, of which 60.5% were Cryptosporidium hominis, 38.2% C. parvum and 1.2% C. parvum plus C. bovis. Analysis of gp60 variants allocated C. parvum found in animals to the zoonotic subtype family IIa (18.9%, subtype IIaA15G1R1 only) and to IId (81.1%, mostly IIdA20G1). In humans 50% were classified as subtype family IIa (IIaA15G1R1 and IIaA15G2R1) and 50% were IIdA20G1. C. andersoni occurred only in cattle older than 1 year. In contrast, mono-infections with one of the three single Cryptosporidium species and the three combinations with C. parvum were more prevalent in cattle and buffaloes younger than 1 year, particularly in those younger than 3 months, and were predominantly subtype family IId. In human samples no Cryptosporidium were identified in children younger than 7 months. Neither place of residence nor the source of drinking-water had measurable effects on prevalence. Remarkably, however, all children with C. parvum subtype family IIa and 86% with subtype family IId had contact to animals. High prevalence and identical genotypes of C. parvum in animals and humans indicate zoonotic transmission due to contact with animals, involving IIdA20G1 as the most frequent subtype.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis is a leading cause of preventable epilepsy in the developing world. Sustainable community-based interventions are urgently needed to control transmission of the causative parasite, Taenia solium. We examined the geospatial relationship between live pigs with visible cysticercotic cysts on their tongues and humans with adult intestinal tapeworm infection (taeniasis) in a rural village in northern Peru. The objective was to determine whether tongue-positive pigs could indicate high-risk geographic foci for taeniasis to guide targeted screening efforts. This approach could offer significant benefit compared to mass intervention. METHODS: We recorded geographic coordinates of all village houses, collected stool samples from all consenting villagers, and collected blood and examined tongues of all village pigs. Stool samples were processed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for presence of Taenia sp. coproantigens indicative of active taeniasis; serum was processed by enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot for antibodies against T. solium cysticercosis (EITB LLGP) and T. solium taeniasis (EITB rES33). FINDINGS: Of 548 pigs, 256 (46.7%) were positive for antibodies against cysticercosis on EITB LLGP. Of 402 fecal samples, 6 (1.5%) were positive for the presence of Taenia sp. coproantigens. The proportion of coproantigen-positive individuals differed significantly between residents living within 100-meters of a tongue-positive pig (4/79, 5.1%) and residents living >100 meters from a tongue-positive pig (2/323, 0.6%) (p = 0.02). The prevalence of taeniasis was >8 times higher among residents living within 100 meters of a tongue-positive pig compared to residents living outside this range (adjusted PR 8.1, 95% CI 1.4-47.0). CONCLUSIONS: Tongue-positive pigs in endemic communities can indicate geospatial foci in which the risk for taeniasis is increased. Targeted screening or presumptive treatment for taeniasis within these high-risk foci may be an effective and practical control intervention for rural endemic areas.",

In the Amazon region, the mechanism of transmission based on the ingestion of eggs present in the liver of wild mammals has been suggested as the cause of the spurious infections described. We performed an epidemiological investigation to determine the incidence, risk of spurious infection and the dynamics of transmission of C. hepaticum in a community of the Brazilian Amazon. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stool samples of 135 individuals, two dog feces and liver tissue from a peccary (captured and eaten by the residents) were analyzed by conventional microscopy. Dog feces were collected from the gardens of households presenting human cases of spurious C. hepaticum infections. Community practices and feeding habits related to the transmission of the parasite were investigated. The individual incidence of spurious infection was 6.7% (95% CI: 2.08-11.24). Cases of spurious infection were observed in 7.5% of the families and the household incidence was from 50% to 83.3%. The risk of spurious infection was 10-fold greater in persons consuming the liver of wild mammals (p = 0.02). The liver tissue of a peccary and one feces sample of a dog presented eggs of C. hepaticum. The consumption of the infected liver was the cause of the spurious infections reported in one household. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first identification of a source of spurious infection by C. hepaticum in humans and we describe a high rate of incidence in household clusters related to game liver alimentary habits. The finding of a dog feces contaminating peridomiciliary ground suggests the risk of new infections. We conclude that the mechanism of transmission based on the ingestion of liver is important for the dynamics of transmission of C. hepaticum in the studied area.",

To determine the prevalence, phenotypic resistance patterns and genetic characteristics of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in fecal carriage and to analyze associated risk factors in children attending a pediatric emergency department in Guinea-Bissau. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From June to September 2010, children <5 years of age with fever or tachycardia attending a pediatric emergency ward during the day was screened for ESBL carriage in feces. Socio-demographic and health seeking behavior data was collected. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested with VITEK2 and EUCAST disk diffusion method, molecular characterization of ESBL-encoding genes was performed with multiplex PCR and clonal relatedness was established by automated rep-PCR. Of 408 enrolled children 133 (32.6%) were ESBL carriers. In total, 83 E. coli and 91 K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing isolates were obtained. Nearly all isolates were multidrug-resistant. Co-resistance to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and aminoglycosides was common. Of the isolates, 38.5% were co-resistant to these classes plus extended-spectrum cephalosporins, which infers resistance to all easily available antibiotic agents for treatment of gram-negative sepsis in Guinea-Bissau. The predominant resistance-encoding gene subgroup was bla(CTX-M-1) and epidemiologic typing showed that the bacterial ESBL population was highly diverse both for E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Bed sharing with another child <5 years of age was a risk factor for ESBL carriage, indicating crowding as a potential risk factor for transmission of ESBL-producing bacteria. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria in this population was high and clonally diverse. This is alarming considering the limited diagnostic and treatment possibilities in Guinea-Bissau and other resource-poor countries.",

SETTING: Quaternary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Patients colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae at the neonatal ICU and the respective household members. INTERVENTIONS: Screening for intestinal extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae colonization was done at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after discharge. Genetic relatedness of isolated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains was determined using automated rep-PCR. RESULTS: Twenty-five neonates (case-patients) colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Escherichia coli; six extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Klebsiella pneumoniae; 11 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Klebsiella oxytoca; and seven extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Serratia marcescens) were included.

The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that histamine-2 receptor (H2-) blockers alter colonic bacterial colonization by analyzing and comparing the fecal microbiota in premature infants with and without H2-blocker therapy using sensitive molecular biological techniques. METHODS: Seventy-six premature infants </=1500 g or <34 weeks gestation were enrolled in this case-controlled, cross-sectional study. Stool samples were collected from 25 infants receiving H2-blockers and 51 babies who had never received them. Following DNA extraction and PCR amplification of 16S rRNA, 454 pyrosequencing was undertaken and the resulting sequences were subjected to comparison with published sequence libraries. RESULTS: Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the major phyla contributing to fecal microbial communities. Microbial diversity was lower, relative abundance of Proteobacteria (primarily of the family Enterobacteriaceae) was increased, whereas that of Firmicutes was decreased in the stools of infants receiving H2-blockers compared with those who had never received them. CONCLUSIONS: Although not designed to look specifically at the effect of H2-blockers on the incidence of NEC, our study suggests that their use lowers fecal microbial diversity and shifts the microfloral pattern toward Proteobacteria. These alterations in fecal microbiota may predispose the vulnerable immature gut to necrotizing enterocolitis and suggest prudence in the use of H2-blockers in the premature infant.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hospital discharge records and laboratory data have shown a substantial early impact from the rotavirus vaccination program that commenced in 2007 in Australia. However, these assessments are affected by the validity and reliability of hospital discharge coding and stool testing to measure the true incidence of hospitalised disease. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of these data sources for disease estimation, both before and after, vaccine introduction. METHODS: All hospitalisations at a major paediatric centre in children aged <5 years from 2000 to 2009 containing acute gastroenteritis (AGE) ICD 10 AM diagnosis codes were linked to hospital laboratory stool testing data. The validity of the rotavirus-specific diagnosis code (A08.0) and the incidence of hospitalisations attributable to rotavirus by both direct estimation and with adjustments for non-testing and miscoding were calculated for pre- and post-vaccination periods. RESULTS: A laboratory record of stool testing was available for 36% of all AGE hospitalisations (n=4948) the rotavirus code had high specificity (98.4%; 95% CI, 97.5-99.1%) and positive predictive value (96.8%; 94.8-98.3%), and modest sensitivity (61.6%; 58-65.1%). Of all rotavirus test positive hospitalisations only a third had a rotavirus code. The estimated annual average number of rotavirus hospitalisations, following adjustment for non-testing and miscoding was 5- and 6-fold higher than identified, respectively, from testing and coding alone. Direct and adjusted estimates yielded similar percentage reductions in annual average rotavirus hospitalisations of over 65%. CONCLUSION: Due to the limited use of stool testing and poor sensitivity of the rotavirus-specific diagnosis code routine hospital discharge and laboratory data substantially underestimate the true incidence of rotavirus hospitalisations and absolute vaccine impact. However, this data can still be used to monitor vaccine impact as the effects of miscoding and under-testing appear to be comparable between pre and post vaccination periods.",

Twenty-six of 29 infants with a fecal elastase value <50 mug/g at study entry had a fecal elastase value <200 mug/g (the accepted cutoff value for pancreatic insufficiency) on all measurements during the year; all 29 had a value <200 mug/g at the end of the study. Of the 48 infants with initial fecal elastase value <200 mug/g, 13 had at least 1 fecal elastase value >200 mug/g but had a final stool fecal elastase value <200 mug/g; however, 4 infants with an initial fecal elastase value <200 mug/g ended the year with a value >200 mug/g. Eleven of 13 infants with an initial fecal elastase value of >200 mug/g still had a value >200 mug/g at the end of the first year. CONCLUSION: Infants with CF exhibit variability in fecal elastase values during the first year. Infants with a fecal elastase level of 50-200 mug/g at diagnosis should be treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, but fecal elastase should be remeasured at age 1 year to ensure that those with a falsely low value do not continue to receive pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy unnecessarily. Those with a fecal elastase value >200 mug/g initially can become pancreatic insufficient with time.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus (RV) vaccines have been available on the private market in Portugal since 2006, with an estimated coverage rising from 16 to 42% between 2007 and 2010. OBJECTIVES: To assess trends, surveillance of children presenting with acute gastroenteritis (AG) to a large paediatric emergency service (ES) in the central region of Portugal was conducted yearly during the winter-spring seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Stool samples, collected throughout five epidemic seasons (January-June, 2006 to 2010) from children </= 36 months of age attending the ES with AG, were tested for RV by immunochromatographic rapid test and positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: A total of 6145 AG cases were identified: 1956 (32%) provided a stool sample (range: 28% in 2008-37% in 2009). The proportion of AG subjects who tested positive for RV fluctuated over the five surveillance seasons (49%, 39%, 25%, 26% and 39%, respectively) as did the distribution of co-circulating RV genotypes. There were no consistent changes in seasonality or age distribution and the proportion of admitted AG subjects who tested RV-positive did not show progressive trends over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate fluctuations in RVAG incidence with no clear progressive trends or seasonal RV shifts among our surveillance subjects over five years, in the context of limited rotavirus vaccine coverage. Significant annual changes in genotype distributions were detected. Higher vaccine coverage may be necessary than at present for consistent impact on disease.",

			"article_name": "Continuous surveillance to reduce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae colonization in the neonatal intensive care unit.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical illness caused by resistant bacteria usually represents a wider problem of asymptomatic colonization. Active surveillance with appropriate institution of isolation precautions represents a potential mechanism to control colonization and reduce infection. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is an environment particularly appropriate for such interventions. Neonates are rarely colonized by resistant bacteria on admission and staff enthusiasm for infection control is high. OBJECTIVE: To reduce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) acquisition amongst neonates through a continuous active surveillance intervention. METHODS: Fecal ESBL-KP cultures were performed weekly on all neonates over 4 years. Neonates with positive cultures were managed with contact precautions by dedicated nurses separately from other neonates. ESBL-KP acquisition amongst neonates staying >7 days was compared for the consecutive years. A subset of ESBL-KP isolates was typed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Surveillance cultures were obtained from 1,482/1,763 (84%) neonates over 4 years. ESBL-KP acquisition decreased continuously from 94/397 (24%) neonates in 2006 to 33/304 (11%) in 2009 (p < 0.001, hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.85, p < 0.001 for comparison of years). Hospital-wide ESBL-KP acquisition did not decrease outside the NICU. PFGE identified identical ESBL-KP strains from multiple neonates on six occasions and different strains from single neonates on seven occasions. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL-KP is probably both imported into and spread within the NICU. Continuous long-term surveillance with cohorting was associated with a decrease in ESBL-KP acquisition within the NICU. This low-risk intervention should be considered as a means to decrease neonatal acquisition of resistant bacteria.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess relationships between marker concentrations of tobacco in meconium and weekly self-reported maternal cigarette consumption, and prediction of neonatal growth outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant mothers (n = 119) from a longitudinal maternal smoking and infant neurobehavioral study (Behavior and Mood in Babies and Mothers [BAM BAM]) provided daily tobacco smoking histories. Nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine concentrations were quantified in 111 neonatal meconium specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Median self-reported third trimester smoking was 5.9 cigarettes per day among smokers. Meconium samples from infants born to non-smokers (n = 42) were negative for tobacco markers, while specimens from self-reported smokers (n = 41) were positive for (median, range) nicotine (50.1 ng/g, 3.9-294), cotinine (73.9 ng/g, 6.4-329), and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (124.5 ng/g, 10.2-478). Quitters (n = 28) self-reported stopping smoking at gestational weeks 2-39. Four meconium specimens from quitters were positive for tobacco biomarkers. Reduced birth weight, length, and head circumference significantly correlated with presence of meconium markers but not with individual or total marker concentrations. Among quitters and smokers, reduced infant birth weight, head circumference, and gestational age correlated with total and average daily cigarette consumption in the second and third trimesters. CONCLUSION: Smoking cessation or reduction during pregnancy improved neonatal outcomes. The window of detection for tobacco in meconium appears to be the third trimester; however, low exposure in this trimester failed to be detected. These results will aid physicians in educating women who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant on the negative consequences of smoking during pregnancy. In addition, infants at risk can be identified at birth to assist early intervention efforts.",

			"article_name": "Assessment of prenatal exposure to arsenic in Tenerife Island.",
			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Increasing awareness of the potential chronic health effects of arsenic (As) at low exposure levels has motivated efforts to better understand impaired child development during pregnancy by biomarkers of exposure. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prenatal exposure to As by analysis of an alternative matrix (meconium), to examine its effects on neonatal outcomes and investigate the association with maternal lifestyle and dietary habits during pregnancy. METHODS: A transversal descriptive study was conducted in Tenerife (Spain). A total of 96 mother-child pairs participated in the study. A questionnaire on sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary habits during pregnancy was administered the day after the delivery. Analysis of total As in meconium was performed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer. RESULTS: Total As was detected in 37 (38.5%) meconium samples. The univariate logistic regression model indicates that prenatal exposure to As was associated with a low intake of eggs per week (OR 0.56; CI (95%): 0.34-0.94) during pregnancy. Conversely, frequent intake of vegetables was associated with prenatal As exposure (OR: 1.19; CI (95%): 1.01-1.41) and frequent intake of processed meat (as bacon, Frankfurt's sausage, and hamburger) shows a trend to As prenatal exposure (OR: 8.54; CI (95%): 0.80-90.89). The adjusted multivariate logistic regression model indicates that only frequent intake of vegetables maintains the association (OR: 1.31; CI (95%): 1.02-1.68). CONCLUSION: The studied population presented a low As exposure and was not associated with neonatal effects. Maternal consumption of vegetables during pregnancy was associated with detectable meconium As levels; however the concentration detected in meconium was too low to be considered a major public health concern in this geographical area.",

METHODS: Pancreatic-specific elastase 1 (PSE1) activity was determined in spot stool samples of 69 preterm infants of gestational age <32 weeks and birth weight <1250 g. Assays were conducted on samples collected at 2 (N = 56), 4 (N = 46), and 6 weeks of age (N = 23). RESULTS: PSE1 activity increased from week 2 (median [interquartile range] 84 [48-187] mug/g) to week 4 (164 [87-251 mug/g; P < 0.001) but not thereafter (169 [82-298] mug/g at week 6). The maturational increase in PSE1 activity was observed only in infants of gestational age <28 weeks (P < 0.001). At 2 weeks after birth, PSE1 levels were lower in infants of gestational age <28 weeks than in infants of gestational age >/= 28 weeks (77 [43-110] vs 165 [56-300] mug/g; P = 0.019), but this difference was less pronounced at 4 weeks (153 [77-226] vs 230 [108-503] mug/g; P = 0.070) and had disappeared by 6 weeks (163 [76-258] vs 175 [85-418] mug/g; P = 0.576). In infants on full enteral feeding regimens 4 weeks after birth, PSE1 levels were associated with weight gain per unit of energy intake (Rs = 0.431; P = 0.005). This measure of weight gain was lower (P = 0.040) in infants with PSE1 levels <200 mug/g (0.110 [0.081-0.139] g/kcal, N = 25) than in those with PSE1 levels >/= 200 mug/g (0.139 [0.117-0.157] g/kcal, N = 15). Administration of pancreatic enzymes to infants showing PSE1 excretion levels <200 mug/g did not enhance weight gain.

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to find out incidence, predictors, onset and severity of respiratory distress including meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) among vigorous neonates born through meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), which may or may not be evident at birth. METHODS: Two hundred ninety vigorous neonates were studied. Data were collected on perinatal risk factors, clinical course and development of respiratory distress. Predictors of respiratory distress were identified by logistic regression and a score based on adjusted OR was assigned for each. Diagnostic performance of the score (0-24) was assessed on another 247 vigorous neonates using receiver operator characteristic analysis (ROC). RESULTS: Respiratory distress developed in 97(33.4 %) infants, MAS in 75(25.9 %). The distress appeared within 12 h in 97.9 %, was severe in only 21.7 %. Of 10 risk factors significantly associated with respiratory distress, seven entered in regression analysis. Fetal distress(adj OR = 11.8; 95%CI = 6.2-22.5), prolonged labor(adj OR = 5.2; 95%CI = 2.5-10.7), and absent/poor cry(adj OR = 5.6; 95%CI = 2.4-13.3) were identified as independent predictors; each assigned a score of 12, 6 and 6, respectively. To predict respiratory distress, a cut-off score of 9 points had sensitivity-74.1 % (95%CI = 63.3 %-82.7 %), specificity-84.6 % (95 % CI = 77.9 %-89.6 %), positive predictive value- 71.6 % (95%CI = 60.8 %-80.4 %), negative predictive value- 86.2 % (95 % CI = 79.6 %-90.9 %), likelihood ratio (LR) + ve 4.8(95%CI = 3.3-7.0) and LR-ve 0.3(95%CI = 0.2-0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory distress occurred in one third neonates, mostly had onset within 12 h of birth, and it was mild to moderate in majority. Fetal distress, prolonged labor, and absent/poor cry predicted respiratory distress and were validated. However, larger studies in different settings are required to confirm its utility.",

			"abstract": "The objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from faecal samples of healthy Ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. One hundred fifty LAB were obtained from 28 healthy Ethiopian infants. The isolates belonged to Lactobacillus (81/150), Enterococcus (54/150) and Streptococcus (15/150) genera. Lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while Enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. Bacteriocin-producing LAB species were isolated from eight of the infants. Many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from Streptococcus salivarius, avicin A (class IIa) from Enterococcus avium, one class IIa bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from E. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from Lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri isolate. Susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. The streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. All enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. Only one E. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. Tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to E. faecalis (47 %) and Enterococcus faecium (33 %). Screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. The structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being E. faecalis and Enterococcus raffinosus. This study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal LAB of Ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.",

METHODS: This study was a stratified, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in premature infants with a birth weight <1500 g and a gestational age <32 weeks who received 3 mL/kg Gastrografin diluted 1:3 with water within their first 24 hours of life, or placebo. RESULTS: Passage of last meconium occurred after a median of 7 days (95% confidence interval: 6-9 days, n = 39) in the intervention group and after 8 days (95% confidence interval: 7-10 days, n = 39) in the control group (P = .61); however, Gastrografin application was associated with a 7.5-day shorter time to full enteral feedings, a 24-day shorter stay in the NICU, and a 17-day reduction in the overall hospital stay in the intervention group compared with the control group. A numerically higher incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (21%) was observed in the intervention group, however. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrografin application did not accelerate meconium evacuation, but the higher stool frequency during the first week of life had a beneficial effect on the time to full enteral feedings and later hospital stay; however, it may increase the necrotizing enterocolitis risk. Further investigations are needed with modified protocols, and the prophylactic use of Gastrografin cannot currently be recommended without further clinical trials.",

The intestinal microbiota of full-term breast-fed infants is considered as the health standard for newborns. A culture medium containing formula milk was designed, which allowed a balanced growth of intestinal microorganisms and was used to perform fecal batch cultures from preterm babies. Sixteen Bifidobacterium strains and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) were tested for their ability to modulate in vitro the intestinal microbiota. The production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was measured by Gas Chromatography and the levels of some anaerobe (Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides groups) and facultative anaerobes (Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Weissella group, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were determined by quantitative PCR. Results were referred to a fecal negative control culture without microorganisms or FOS added. Strains that in fecal cultures counteracted better the aberrancies previously found in feces of preterm babies, as compared with full-term breast-fed infants, were selected. The three Bifidobacterium bifidum strains tested in this work promoted the most suitable shifts in SCFA and in the ratio of variables facultative anaerobes to anaerobes. Two Bifidobacterium breve strains complied with the requirement for facultative anaerobes and anaerobes and one of them also promoted a suitable shift of SCFA. Bifidobacteria behaved similarly as FOS regarding the microbial profiles in fecal cultures but the production of lactic and acetic acid was much lower. B. breve and B. bifidum strains selected represent promising candidates for their assessment in more complex in vitro and in vivo models.",

Identifying the risk factors for cholera provides evidence for targeted prevention and control measures. METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to identify cholera risk factors. Using stool culture as the standard, we evaluated a cholera point of care test in the field. RESULTS: 176 participants were recruited: 54 cases and 122 controls. Independent risk factors for cholera were: being over 20 years of age (aOR 2.5; 95%CI 1.1, 5.4), defecating in the open air (or river) (aOR 4.5; 95% CI 1.4, 14.4) and knowing someone who travelled to a cholera affected area (aOR 4.1; 95%CI 1.6, 10.7); while the availability of soap for handwashing at home was protective (aOR 0.41; 95%CI 0.19, 0.87). Those reporting access to a piped water distribution system in the home were twice as likely to report the availability of soap for handwashing. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were 72% (95% CI 47-90) and 71% (95%CI 44-90%). CONCLUSIONS: Improving population access to the piped water distribution system and sanitation will likely reduce transmission by enabling enhanced hygiene and limiting the contamination of water sources. The One step V. cholerae O1/O139 Antigen Test is of limited utility for clinical decision making in a hospital setting with access to traditional laboratory methods.

In 2008, 203 mussel samples and 202 water samples from artesian wells were tested for HAV-RNA. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2009, the incidence of acute hepatitis A declined from 14.8 to 0.8 per 100,000. The most frequent risk factors reported by cases in 2008-2009 were shellfish consumption (85%) and travel outside of Puglia or Italy (26%). Seroepidemiologic survey revealed high susceptibility to HAV in children and adults up to age 30 (65%-70%). None of the mussel or water samples were HAV-positive. Phylogenetic analysis revealed co-circulation of subtypes IA (74%) and IB (26%) and clustering of strains with strains from Germany and France, and those previously circulating in Puglia. CONCLUSION: Vaccination and improved sanitation reduced the incidence of hepatitis A. Strict monitoring and improved vaccination coverage are needed to prevent disease resurgence.",

The suggested role of intestinal microbiota in the development of NEC needs to be elucidated. METHODS: This prospective single-centre case-control study applied barcoded pyrosequencing to map the bacterial composition of faecal samples from extremely preterm infants. Ten patients were diagnosed with NEC and matched to healthy controls with regard to sex, gestational age and mode of delivery prior to analysis of the samples. RESULTS: Enterococcus, Bacillales and Enterobacteriaceae dominated the flora. Although not statistically significant, a high relative abundance of Bacillales and Enterobacteriaceae was detected at early time points in patients developing NEC, while healthy controls had a microbiota more dominated by Enterococcus. A low diversity of intestinal microbial flora was found without any differences between NEC patients and controls. In 16 healthy controls, Firmicutes (Enterococcus and Bacillales) dominated the faecal flora during the first weeks after birth and were then succeeded by Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the composition of intestinal microbiota of patients developing NEC were detected; however, some findings need to be scrutinized in subsequent studies.",

			"abstract": "Rotaviruses (RVs) are the main cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in both humans and young animals of various species such as calves, horses, pigs, dogs, cats, and birds. The genetic diversity of RVs is related to a variety of evolutionary mechanisms, including point mutation, and genome reassortment. The objective of this study was to characterize molecularly genes that encode structural and nonstructural proteins in unusual RV strains. The clinical specimens selected for this study were obtained from children and newborn with RV gastroenteritis, who participated in research projects on viral gastroenteritis conducted at the Evandro Chagas Institute. Structural (VP1-VP4, VP6, and VP7) and nonstructural (NSP1-NSP6) genes were amplified from stool samples by the polymerase chain reaction and subsequently sequenced. Eight unusual RV strains isolated from children and newborn with gastroenteritis were studied. Reassortment between genes of animal origin were observed in 5/8 (62.5%) strains analyzed. These results demonstrate that, although rare, interspecies (animal-human) transmission of RVs occurs in nature, as observed in the present study in strains NB150, HSP034, HSP180, HST327, and RV10109. This study is the first to be conducted in the Amazon region and supports previous data showing a close relationship between genes of human and animal origin, representing a challenge to the large-scale introduction of RV vaccines in national immunization programs.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: : Helicobacter pylori colonization/infection can be transitory or persistent, conditions that have not been thoroughly evaluated in young children. We aimed to characterize the dynamics of H. pylori stool detection and to determine host and environmental factors and symptoms associated with persistence. METHOD: : In a 5-year cohort study, we followed-up infants from birth with clinic visits every 3 months. Symptoms and environmental risk factor survey and a stool sample for H. pylori antigen detection were requested in every visit. Secretor/ABH histo-blood group phenotype was determined in saliva. RESULTS: : Overall, 218 of 1456 (15%) stool samples were positive for H. pylori and 39 of 96 (41%) children had at least 1 positive sample. Stool detection was transitory in 16 of 39 (41%), persistent in 19 (49%) and undetermined in 4 (10%) children. Persistence was acquired largely during the first 24 months (17/19 cases) and was associated with nonsecretor phenotype (32% versus 0% for transitory infection; P = 0.02) and daycare attendance (67% versus 26% for never infected; P = 0.019). Symptoms possibly associated with persistence were referred in only 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: : Nearly 20% of this Chilean cohort had persistent H. pylori stool sample detections during the first 5 years of life, acquired mostly during the first 24 months. Persistence was significantly associated with nonsecretor phenotype and daycare attendance, and possibly associated gastrointestinal symptoms were rare. This relatively common group of young children with persistent H. pylori colonization/infection will require further study.",

			"abstract": "Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Morocco during 2010. In anticipation of introducing rotavirus vaccines, the Ministry of Health in Morocco established a rotavirus surveillance network in June 2006 at four hospitals in Morocco to obtain baseline data on rotavirus disease burden and prevalent strains. From June 2006 to May 2009, stool samples were collected from children under 5 years of age admitted for diarrhea to four sentinel hospitals serving different regions of Morocco. Rotaviruses were detected in stools using enzyme immunoassay, then genotyped by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Samples with adequate stool in which the P or G types could not be determined by RT-PCR were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. Overall, 42% (579 of 1,388) of the stools samples tested were positive for rotavirus. Genotyping of 548 (95%) samples demonstrated that G1P[8] (55%) was the most prevalent strain, followed by G9P[8] (11.3%), G2P[4] (9.1%), G4P[8] (0.9%), and G3P[8] (0.4%). Several other strains were identified including G1P[4] (0.2%), G1P[6] (0.9%), G2P[6] (4.3%), G2P[8] (0.2%), G3P[6] (0.4%), G3P[4] (0.2%), and G9P[6] (0.2%). A high prevalence of mixed infections was found (15% of all samples) of which G1G2P[8] (4%) and G1G3P[8] (3.6%) accounted for the majority. Considerable diversity of rotavirus genotypes was present among strains circulating in Morocco prior to the introduction of the vaccine. This study highlighted the need for maintaining active surveillance to monitor changes in rotavirus disease burden and strain dynamics and to detect changes over time that could impact the effectiveness of the vaccination program.",

Currently, there is no validated multiplex real-time PCR that can detect and quantify RoV and NoV simultaneously. The aim of the study was to develop, validate, and internally control a multiplex one-step RT real-time PCR to detect and quantify RoV and NoV in stool samples. PCR sensitivity was assessed by comparing amplification against the current gold standard, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), on stool samples from 94 individuals with diarrhea and 94 individuals without diarrhea. PCR detected 10% more RoV positive samples than EIA in stools samples from patients with diarrhea. PCR detected 23% more NoV genogroup II positive samples from individuals with diarrhea and 9% more from individuals without diarrhea than EIA, respectively. Genotyping of the PCR positive/EIA negative samples suggested the higher rate of PCR positivity, in comparison to EIA, was due to increased sensitivity, rather than nonspecific hybridization. Quantitation demonstrated that the viral loads of RoV and NoV in the stools of diarrheal patients were an order of magnitude greater than in individuals without diarrhea. This internally controlled real-time PCR method is robust, exhibits a high degree of reproducibility, and may have a greater utility and sensitivity than commercial EIA kits.",

			"abstract": "AIM: To determine perinatal parameters among term newborn infants born by vaginal delivery with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) that needed paediatrician assistance. METHODS: Paediatricians who were in attendance in the delivery room due to MSAF among term infants completed 775 reports regarding the infants' delivery conditions, and the assistance provided. We defined 'paediatrician attendance needed' for a subgroup of infants for whom we retrospectively determined that paediatrician attendance in the delivery room was required. RESULTS: 'Paediatrician attendance needed' was determined in 31 (4%) cases. Among cases with documented normal foetal monitor, only 10 (1.8%) were defined as 'paediatrician attendance needed', a percentage significantly lower than among infants born following non-reassuring foetal monitor: 21 (9.7%) (p < 0.001). 'Paediatrician attendance needed' was predicted by non-reassuring foetal monitor [OR 6.02 (CI 2.72-13.31), p < 0.001], maternal fever [OR 6.34 (1.92-20.92), p = 0.002] and younger maternal age (for every year) [OR 0.889 (CI 0.82-0.96), p = 0.003]. CONCLUSIONS: Term newborn infants born by vaginal delivery with MSAF with documented normal tracing foetal monitor are at low risk of the need for paediatrician assistance. Paediatrician attendance in the delivery room in labour involving MSAF should be recommended when non-reassuring foetal monitor tracing is observed and should also be considered when maternal fever is recorded, and/or thick meconium is observed.",

In total, faecal samples from 13.9% of 165 volunteers and 36.1% of 416 swabs from the regional microbiology hospital laboratory were positive for stx genes after screening by PCR. Isolation of STEC and of E. coli O157 from stx-positive faecal samples was performed by a filter-hybridization protocol and by automated immunomagnetic separation, respectively, and isolates were further characterized by serotyping, virulence typing by PCR and toxin production by the Vero cell assay. STEC were isolated from two samples only, an O146:H21 isolate from one of the volunteers and an O157:H7 isolate from a human case of diarrhoea. To conclude; the results show that it is not unusual to detect stx genes in faecal samples from humans in Norway, both from asymptomatic people and from people with gastrointestinal illness. This finding emphasizes the importance of correct diagnostic criteria for interpretation of the finding of an occasional stx-positive sample or an STEC isolate when searching for an aetiological agent of human cases of diarrhoea.",

Furthermore, we determined the influence of perinatal factors on the development of the faecal microbiota. In a randomised controlled trial, preterm infants with gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1,500 g received enteral supplementation of scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS or placebo (maltodextrin) between days 3 and 30 of life. Faecal microbiota, as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH), and microenvironment [short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), pH, sIgA] were measured at four time points: before the start of the study and at days 7, 14 and 30 of life. In total, 113 preterm infants were included. Enteral supplementation of the prebiotic mixture increased the total bacteria count at day 14 (Exp 3.92; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.18-13.04, p = 0.03), but not at day 30 (Exp 1.73; 95 % CI 0.60-5.03, p = 0.31). There was a trend toward increased bifidobacteria counts. There was a delayed intestinal colonisation of all bacteria. Enteral supplementation of the prebiotic mixture decreased the faecal pH (Exp 0.71; 95 % CI 0.54-0.93, p = 0.01) and there was a trend toward increased acetic acid compared to the placebo group (Exp 1.09; 95 % CI 0.99-1.20, p = 0.10).

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Clinical trials for two rotavirus vaccines recommended by the WHO for global use since 2009 have successfully demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in a wide range of countries. To control the burden of severe and fatal diarrheal disease, the Ministry of Health of Morocco introduced the single strain rotavirus vaccine into their national immunization program in 2010. METHODS: We employed a standard WHO case definition to identify children under 5 hospitalized with AGE at four hospitals from June 2006 to May 2010 to establish baseline burden of rotavirus disease before introduction of vaccine. Stool samples were collected and tested for rotavirus using a standard enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Overall, 40% (741 of 1841) of the children hospitalized with AGE tested positive for rotavirus, making it the single most common cause of severe gastroenteritis among children in Morocco. Applying this prevalence to the estimates of diarrheal hospitalizations and deaths in Morocco, we estimate that rotavirus annually causes 19,646 hospitalizations and 1604 deaths in children under 5 years of age. DISCUSSION: On the basis of these surveillance data, we estimate that 1 in 389 Moroccan children died and 1 in 32 was hospitalized due to rotavirus before their fifth birthday. A considerable proportion of these deaths and hospitalizations should be preventable through vaccination, and the 4 years of stable prevaccine surveillance in Morocco will be a tremendously useful platform for assessing potential changes in the epidemiology of rotavirus disease and measuring impact of the new rotavirus vaccine program in Morocco.",

			"abstract": "The establishment of a pioneer gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a crucial stage in neonatal development influencing health throughout life. While current knowledge is mainly based on either culture or molecular analysis of feces, we opted for a comprehensive approach complementing culture with state-of-the-art molecular methods. The bacterial composition in feces from seven healthy vaginally-delivered, breast-fed neonates was analyzed at days 4-6, 9-14 and 25-30 postnatal, using culture, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolates, quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing. Anaerobes outnumbered facultative anaerobes in all seven neonates within the first days of life, owing to high levels of Bifidobacterium and unexpectedly also Bacteroides, which were inversely correlated. Four neonates harbored maternal Bacteroides levels, comprising typical adult species, throughout the neonatal period, while in three only subdominant levels were detected. In contrast, the major adult-type butyrate-producing anaerobic populations, Roseburia and Faecalibacterium, remained undetectable during the neonatal period. The presence of Bacteroidetes as pioneer bacteria in the majority of neonates studied demonstrates that adult-type strict anaerobes may reach adult-like population densities within the first week of life. Consequently the switch from facultative to strict anaerobes may occur earlier than previously assumed in breast-fed neonates, and the establishment of the major butyrate-producing populations may be limited by other factors than the absence of anaerobic conditions. The impact of breast milk components on the timing of establishment of anaerobic pioneer bacteria, as well as opportunistic pathogens should be further studied in regard to priming of the gut-associated immune system and consequences on later health.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Quinolones are potent broad-spectrum bactericidal agents increasingly employed also in resource-limited countries. Resistance to quinolones is an increasing problem, known to be strongly associated with quinolone exposure. We report on the emergence of quinolone resistance in a very remote community in the Amazon forest, where quinolones have never been used and quinolone resistance was absent in 2002. METHODS: The community exhibited a considerable level of geographical isolation, limited contact with the exterior and minimal antibiotic use (not including quinolones). In December 2009, fecal carriage of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli was investigated in 120 of the 140 inhabitants, and in 48 animals reared in the community. All fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were genotyped and characterized for the mechanisms of plasmid- and chromosomal-mediated quinolone resistance. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Despite the characteristics of the community remained substantially unchanged during the period 2002-2009, carriage of quinolone-resistant E. coli was found to be common in 2009 both in humans (45% nalidixic acid, 14% ciprofloxacin) and animals (54% nalidixic acid, 23% ciprofloxacin). Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of human and animal origin showed multidrug resistance phenotypes, a high level of genetic heterogeneity, and a combination of GyrA (Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn) and ParC (Ser80Ile) substitutions commonly observed in fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Remoteness and absence of antibiotic selective pressure did not protect the community from the remarkable emergence of quinolone resistance in E. coli. Introduction of the resistant strains from antibiotic-exposed settings is the most likely source, while persistence and dissemination in the absence of quinolone exposure is likely mostly related with poor sanitation. Interventions aimed at reducing the spreading of resistant isolates (by improving sanitation and water/food safety) are urgently needed to preserve the efficacy of quinolones in resource-limited countries, as control strategies based only on antibiotic restriction policies are unlikely to succeed in those settings.",

The prevalence of both organisms is known to peak in densely populated, low resource settings and children are infected early in life. Different Giardia genotypes/assemblages have been associated with different symptoms and H. pylori with induction of cancer. Despite this, not much data are available from sub-Saharan Africa with regards to the prevalence of different G. intestinalis assemblages and their potential association with H. pylori infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fecal samples from 427 apparently healthy children, 0-12 years of age, living in urban Kampala, Uganda were analyzed for the presence of H. pylori and G. intestinalis. G. intestinalis was found in 86 (20.1%) out of the children and children age 1<5 years had the highest rates of colonization. H. pylori was found in 189 (44.3%) out of the 427 children and there was a 3-fold higher risk of concomitant G. intestinalis and H. pylori infections compared to non-concomitant G. intestinalis infection, OR = 2.9 (1.7-4.8). No significant association was found in the studied population with regard to the presence of Giardia and gender, type of toilet, source of drinking water or type of housing. A panel of 45 G. intestinalis positive samples was further analyzed using multi-locus genotyping (MLG) on three loci, combined with assemblage-specific analyses. Giardia MLG analysis yielded a total of five assemblage AII, 25 assemblage B, and four mixed assemblage infections. The assemblage B isolates were highly genetically variable but no significant association was found between Giardia assemblage type and H. pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that Giardia assemblage B dominates in children in Kampala, Uganda and that the presence of H. pylori is an associated risk factor for G. intestinalis infection.",

For successfully developing of such strategies, a detailed knowledge of the microbiota establishment process in these infants is needed. In a previous study we evidenced clear alterations in the process of microbiota establishment in preterm newborns when compared with a control group of full-term breast-fed infants. Here we have analyzed these data more in depth, corroborating a reduced proportion of strict anaerobes with respect to facultatives in the fecal microbiota of preterm infants. The potential benefits, as well as the side effects, of strategies aimed at counterbalancing this alteration in the facultative to strict anaerobes ratio are discussed in this addendum.",

			"abstract": "In a pilot study, we found that the NIRS measurements were highly variable and dramatically decreased or disappeared sporadically while monitoring gastro-intestinal (GI) StO(2) on preterm neonates. We hypothesized that the light absorption characteristics of different neonatal and infant stool types may be interfering with NIRS GI measurements. METHODS: Meconium, transitional, and mature stool samples collected from preterm neonates and older infants (ranging from a few days to weeks in age) were analyzed by a bench-top spectrometer to measure light absorbance in the near infrared range (650-950 nm). RESULTS: Some meconium and transitional stool samples were noted to have a more marked increase in light absorbance as wavelength decreases towards 650 nm, when compared to more mature stools. When compared to the light absorbance spectra of deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)), there is a high potential that Hb and HbO(2) may be erroneously calculated, resulting in falsely low GI StO(2). DISCUSSION: Meconium and green colored transitional stools demonstrate a light absorbance spectra that may interfere with NIRS GI measurements, possibly due to their higher biliverdin content, which exhibits a broad spectral absorption peak at 660 nm. Caution is warranted in interpreting GI StO(2) NIRS results in neonates still passing meconium and transitional stools until NIRS-based tissue oximeters to measure GI StO(2) can compensate for the presence of these stool types.",

Although the effects of several factors on fetal calprotectin have been studied, the effect of phototherapy is not known. In this study, we analyzed the effect of phototherapy on fetal calprotectin levels. METHODS: Ninety breast-fed newborns (46 male, 44 female) who were hospitalized for indirect hyperbilirubinemia and treated with phototherapy were included to the study. Forty-two of them were term and 44 of them were preterm. Newborns treated with phototherapy (n = 53) constituted the phototherapy group (29 preterm, 24 term) and 37 newborns who did not receive phototherapy (19 preterm, 18 term) constituted the control group. Fecal samples were collected 24 hours after phototherapy had been started. Fecal samples (100 mg) were weighed with sensitive scales and preserved at -80 degrees C after buffering with a special solution. All samples were studied at the same time with a fecal calprotectin kit by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant difference between fecal calprotectin levels of term and preterm babies who received phototherapy and babies who did not receive phototherapy.

Fourteen ESC-resistant Salmonella isolates were tested towards 22 antimicrobial agents. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to determine the underlying genetic determinants responsible for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes. Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR was employed to type the isolates. All tested isolates were resistant to ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin, cefuroxime, aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefotaxime (except two isolates), cefepime, and cefpirome. PCR and DNA sequencing identified these ESBLs as TEM-48 (n=6), TEM-4 (n=3), CTX-M-15 (n=4), and one new TEM, designated TEM-188. Thus, continued surveillance for the presence of ESBL-producing (non-typhoidal) salmonellae in Algeria is essential.",

METHODS: Ninety-nine stools from 38 infants of median 27-week gestation were cultured; 44 stools from 27 infants had their microbial profiles determined by 16S. Ordination analyses explored effects of patient variables on gut communities. RESULTS: Standard microbiological culture identified a mean of two organisms (range 0-7), DGGE 12 (range 3-18) per patient. Enterococcus faecalis and coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS) were most common by culture (40% and 39% of specimens). Meconium was not sterile. No fungi were cultured. Bacterial community structures in infants with NEC and LOS differed from healthy infants. Infants who developed NEC carried more CONS (45% vs 30%) and less Enterococcus faecalis (31% vs 57%). 16S identified Enterobacter and Staphylococcus presence associated with NEC/LOS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences were found in the gut microbiota of preterm infants who develop NEC/LOS.

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diarrhoea is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of the main causes of hospital admissions in rural areas of Kenya. In Kenya, antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted only at the institutional levels, with limited sharing of information and analysis of data. As a result, the actual scale of regional or national antimicrobial drug resistance is not well defined. METHODOLOGY: Stool samples were collected between 1 October 2007 and 30 September 2008 from a total of 651 outpatients with diarrhoea who were under five years of age in four provinces of Kenya.  Conventional, biochemical methods, multiplex PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility were conducted to identify the bacterial causes and virulence factors in the isolates, respectively.  RESULTS: Of the 651 patients screened, we identified the causes of 115 cases (17.7%) as follows: Pathogenic E. coli (11.2%) [enteroaggregative (8.9%), enterotoxigenic (1.2%), enteroinvasive (0.6%), shigatoxigenic (0.5%)], Salmonella (3.5%), Shigella (2%) and Vibrio cholera O1 (0.7%). The highest levels of resistance among the E. coli isolates were observed in ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole each at 95% followed by tetracycline at 81%. Shigella isolate levels of resistance ranged from 80% to 100% for ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: The highest prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was to ampicillin followed by trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline. Though still at low levels, the major concern from our findings is the emerging resistance of enteric pathogens that was observed to quinolones (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin) and gentamycin.",

To evaluate side effects of PDE inhibitors, this study analyzed changes in blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) during and after intravenous aminophylline in the animal model of MAS. Oxygen-ventilated rabbits were given meconium intratracheally (25 mg/ml, 4 ml/kg) or saline. Thirty minutes later, the animals were treated by intravenous aminophylline (Syntophyllin, 2 mg/kg) or saline (sham-treated controls). A second dose of the treatment was given 2 h later. During (5 min) and immediately after (5 min) the treatment, and during 5 h after the treatment, mean blood pressure in the femoral artery (MAP), HR and HRV were evaluated. In meconium-instilled animals, increases in MABP, HR, and HRV were observed already 5 min after aminophylline administration, while in saline-instilled animals aminophylline increased HR and caused inconsistant changes in HRV parameters compared to sham-treated animals. Within 5 h after the treatment administration, MAP, HR, and HRV parameters gradually returned to the initial values. Concluding, intravenous aminophylline may lead to acute cardiovascular changes. Thus, if aminophylline is used for treatment of MAS, its possible cardiovascular effects should be considered, particularly in patients with cardiovascular instability.",

The right lung was used to determine lung edema by wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio. Total antioxidant status (TAS) in blood plasma was evaluated. W/D ratio increased and capillary patency time shortened significantly, whereas the initial pressure increased and TAS decreased insignificantly in Sal vs. Con groups. Meconium instillation potentiated edema formation and neutrophil influx into the lungs, reduced capillary patency and TAS, and decreased the surfactant quality compared with both Sal and Con groups (p > 0.05). Each of the anti-inflammatory agents reduced lung edema and neutrophil influx into the lung and partly reversed surfactant dysfunction in the MAS model, with a superior effect observed after glucocorticoids and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alterations in intestinal microflora have been linked to the development of allergic disease. Recent studies suggest that healthy infant immune development may depend on the establishment of a diverse gut microbiota rather than the presence or absence of specific microbial strains. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between diversity of gut microbiota in the early postnatal period and subsequent development of eczema and atopy in the first year of life. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected 1 wk after birth from 98 infants at high risk of allergic disease, who were followed prospectively to age 12 months. Fecal microbial diversity was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) using restriction enzymes Sau96I and AluI, with a greater number of peaks representing greater diversity of bacterial communities. RESULTS: Microbial diversity at day 7 was significantly lower in infants with eczema at age 12 months as compared to infants without eczema (AluI mean number of peaks 13.1 vs. 15.5, p = 0.003, 95% CI for difference in means -3.9, -0.8; Sau96I 14.7 vs. 17.2, p = 0.03, 95% CI -4.9, -0.3). No differences were observed for atopic compared to non-atopic infants, or infants with two allergic parents compared to those with one or no allergic parent. CONCLUSIONS: A more diverse intestinal microbiota in the first week of life is associated with a reduced risk of subsequent eczema in infants at increased risk of allergic disease. Interventions that enhance microbial diversity in early life may provide an effective means for the prevention of eczema in high-risk infants.",

The RV and NoV strains were genotyped by PCR and/or sequencing. RV and NoV infections occurred with a prevalence of 34.5% and 25.5% respectively, with predominance in children <1 year. Most infections occurred during the dry season with increasing prevalence of RV as the dry season progressed (October-January).

RESULTS: E. moshkovskii and E. histolytica caused diarrhea and weight loss in susceptible mice. E. dispar infected none of the mouse strains tested.

Bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after birth. Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium catenulatum group and Bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. Intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the Enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. Faecal pH was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. The initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 muM/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 muM/g of faeces. Early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the Clostridium coccoides group, the Clostridium leptum subgroup, Prevotella, and Atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. Population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the Bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by Caesarean section than in those delivered normally. The results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.",

Bacterial pathogens were recovered from 279/1526 (18.3%) stool specimens and viral pathogens were detected in 178/1526 (11.7%) stool specimens. The top five pathogenic species were diarrhoeagenic E. coli (n = 140, 9.2%), rotavirus (n = 79, 5.2%), Shigella spp. (n = 69, 4.5%), Salmonella spp. (n = 66, 4.3%) and norovirus (n = 56, 3.7%). The prevalence of pathogens showed correlation with age, season and clinical symptoms. Several dominant serotypes were identified in Shigella and Salmonella isolates, and high prevalence of multiple drug-resistant isolates was observed in both species. This important information will have a significant effect on public health policy development and resource prioritization practices.",

STUDY DESIGN: The two prediction models were applied in women in active labor at more than 36 gestational weeks with singleton fetuses in cephalic presentation and with high-risk pregnancies (n = 5049) who were included in a Swedish randomized trial between December 1, 1998, and June 4, 2000. The prognostic ability of the models was determined using calibration and discrimination measures. RESULTS: Of 5049 infants in the validation population, 54 (1.1%) suffered from metabolic acidosis. After adjustment for incidence differences between the Dutch and Swedish cohorts, the prognostic models showed good calibration and moderate overall discrimination (C statistic 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.71; and 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.72), for models 1 and 2, respectively). CONCLUSION: External validation of the clinical prediction models for metabolic acidosis in Swedish infants showed good calibration and moderate discriminative ability.

Whereas fecal calprotectin (fCP) has been reported to have insufficient sensitivity and specificity, no previous study has stratified for gestational and postnatal age. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide developmental specific fCP data in premature infants and to analyze its value in detecting intestinal distress and episodes of NEC. METHODS: Between April 2008 and December 2009, 1,899 fecal samples were obtained from 206 very low birth weight infants. RESULTS: Mean gestational age (GA) was 28.5 weeks and birth weight 1,057 g. 19 (9.2%) patients developed NEC stage II+, of whom 5 had fulminant NEC with unusually low fCP concentrations in meconium and afterwards. fCP levels showed significant gestational and postnatal age dependent dynamics with particularly low levels in extremely premature infants. In infants with a GA <26 + 1 weeks using GA-adapted reference values, the sensitivity for discriminating moderate NEC from healthy infants and infants with intestinal distress was 0.89 for a cut-off of 180 and 210 microg/g, respectively, at onset of symptoms. Specificity was 0.96 and 0.84. Fulminant NEC was characterized by unusually low fCP concentrations with a cut-off of <24 microg/g having a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.72 for identifying those cases. CONCLUSIONS: fCP levels depend on gestational and postnatal age and in contrast to adults, there is a lower limit in premature infants. Taking these observations into account when defining reference values and interpreting fCP data in the clinical context, fCP can be a useful marker in identifying premature infants with gastrointestinal distress and NEC in particular.",

We stratified diarrheal incidence by 6-month age categories, season, and El Nino, and modeled between-subject heterogeneity with random effects Poisson models. RESULTS: Spring diarrheal incidence increased by 55% during El Nino compared with before El Nino. This increase was most acute among children older than 60 months, for whom the risk of a diarrheal episode during the El Nino spring was nearly 100% greater (relative risk=1.96; 95% confidence interval=1.24, 3.09). CONCLUSIONS: El Nino-associated climate variability affects community rates of diarrhea, particularly during the cooler seasons and among older children. Public health officials should develop preventive strategies for future El Nino episodes to mitigate the increased risk of diarrheal disease in vulnerable communities.",

This work was therefore aimed at the characterization of Bifidobacterium strains capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogens typical of the infant gastrointestinal tract and of coliforms isolated from colic newborns. Among the 46 Bifidobacterium strains considered, 16 showed high antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens; these strains were further characterized from a taxonomic point of view, for the presence and transferability of antibiotic resistances, for citotoxic effects and adhesion to nontumorigenic gut epithelium cell lines. Moreover, their ability to stimulate gut health by increasing the metabolic activity and the immune response of epithelial cells was also studied. The examination of all these features allowed to identify three Bifidobacterium breve strains and a Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum strain as potential probiotics for the treatments of enteric disorders in newborns such as infantile colics.

The effect of gestational length, feeding and delivery method was compared to the pattern of bacterial acquisition. RESULTS: Intestinal bacterial diversity was lower in preterm compared with term infants. For term infants, bacterial DNA detection rates were not associated with feeding or delivery method, although Enterobacteria and Clostridia were commonly identified. The detection rate of Bifidobacteria was lower in preterm infants than term infants. Potential pathogens were detected in preterm infant samples.

Before their introduction into food products, the safety of new isolates has to be evaluated. The objective of this study was to characterize LAB isolates from the stool of a newborn infant, and evaluate their safety and probiotic potential, in vitro. Thirty colonies were identified as Lactobacillus gasseri through sequencing of 16S rDNA. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis using restriction enzymes SmaI and Apa I revealed that 29 of the L. gasseri were nearly identical, however one isolate exhibited a distinctive DNA fingerprint. All 30 L. gasseri were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics, bile tolerance, hemolytic activity and antagonism toward selected pathogens. All 30 strains harbored three plasmids, with one strain that showed strong tolerance to 0.5% of bile and harbored a unique fourth plasmid encoding a putative multidrug resistance transporter protein (LmrB). No hemolytic activity or antagonism, beyond acid inhibition was observed. Three selected strains UFVCC1083, 1091 and 1112 showed strong resistance to simulated small intestinal and gastric juices and adhered in vitro to mucin and two intestinal epithelial cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29.

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Shigellosis represents one of the main causes of bloody diarrhoea in South America. This study aimed to establish the incidence of shigellosis in an urban zone of Buenos Aires, Argentina, by examining the type of Shigella and living conditions associated with this infection. METHODOLOGY: Between January 2009 and December 2010 we analyzed shigellosis in children admitted to the public health service with bloody diarrhoea from La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A total of 372 children under 15 years old with Shigella present in their stool samples were admitted to the study. Variables studied were patient age, type of Shigella, family economic status, and access to sewage services and safe drinking water. RESULTS: Shigella flexneri was found to be present in 66.8% of the cases. Incidence was 187 cases/year/100,000 children under 15 years old. Cases were mainly observed during the summer (38.5%) in the population of under 5 years old (69.1% of all cases). The risk of shigellosis increased 12 times in those children who lacked safe drinking water and this risk increased 1.5 times in the population without sewage services. Fewer cases of shigellosis were noted in downtown areas, while hot spots were identified in the suburbs. Treating one case of shigellosis has a local cost of US $976 while assuring safe drinking water and sewage services for one family costs US $634.  CONCLUSION: Incidence of shigellosis in urban areas is associated with quality of water and sewage services. Policies aimed at providing education and improving public utilities networks can help to reduce the incidence of shigellosis.",

Numerous studies have shown the association between HEV infections and type 1 diabetes. Here, the prevalence of HEV infections was studied in healthy Swedish children with increased HLA-associated risk for type 1 diabetes participating in the PRODIA pilot study in which children were randomized to receive probiotics or placebo during the first 6 months of life. Stool specimens collected from 197 children in every 3 months from the age of 3 to 24 months were screened for HEV using traditional viral culturing method and identified with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of the partial VP1 coding part of the viral genome. Altogether 4.8% (52/1,094) of the specimens were HEV-positive and 22.3% (44/197) of the children excreted HEV during the follow-up. HEV-A and HEV-B were present in 2.1 and 2.7% of the specimens, respectively. HEV-C and HEV-D viruses were not detected. In total, 17 different HEV serotypes were detected and the most common findings were CV-A9 (13.5%), CV-A16 (11.5%), and CV-A2 (9.6%). The majority of the infections (92.3%) were during the enterovirus season extending from July to December. Probiotic treatment did not affect significantly the risk of HEV infections during the 2-year follow-up although a trend for transient decrease for HEV positivity (HEV-A and/or HEV-B) by the age of 12 months was observed in children who received probiotics [OR 0.40; 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 1.08; P-value 0.071, generalized estimating (GEE) analysis]. According to the results, HEV-A findings were nearly as common as HEV-B findings among the healthy children participating in this study.

			"abstract": "PURPOSE: Meconium ileus (MI) is the earliest clinical manifestation of cystic fibrosis (CF), occurring in up to 20% of patients with CF. Our aim was to review and integrate current knowledge about the diagnosis and management of fetuses and neonates with MI that may aid the pediatric surgeon in caring for these patients. METHODS: We identified areas of interest including pathophysiology, prenatal diagnosis, nonoperative and operative management, postoperative management, and prognosis. We performed a Medline search using the search term meconium ileus for English language articles published in the last 20 years. We reviewed reference lists to identify other articles of historical significance. RESULTS: Meconium ileus is primarily associated with CF transmembrane (conductance) regulator mutations F508del, G542X, W1282X, R553X, and G551D, and modifier genes have been found to explain approximately 17% of the phenotypic variability. Mouse, pig, and ferret models for CF demonstrate neonatal bowel obstruction mimicking MI. Sonographic findings of hyperechoic masses and dilated bowel in a high-risk fetus are suggestive of MI. Less than 7% of low-risk fetuses with hyperechoic bowel will have MI. Contemporary series of noninvasive management with Gastrografin enema report success rates of 36% to 39%, significantly lower than historical values. The optimal surgical technique remains controversial, although primary anastomosis results in surgical complication rates between 21% and 31%, higher than those noted with delayed anastomosis. Pulmonary function for patients with CF and MI at 15 and 25 years old is similar to those without MI, although height and weight percentiles may be lower. CONCLUSIONS: This review for pediatric surgeons presents an examination of the literature and synthesizes current information about the pathophysiology, prenatal diagnosis, nonoperative and operative management, postoperative management, and prognosis of the patient with CF and MI.",

METHODS/DESIGN: The study, running in three European hospitals, is a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study funded from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] within the project 'Impact of Specific Antibiotic Therapies on the prevalence of hUman host ResistaNt bacteria' (acronym SATURN). Nasal and rectal screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae will be obtained at hospital admission, discharge, at antibiotic start (t0, within one hour) and at the following intervals: day 3 (t1), 7 (t2), 15 (t3), and 30 (t4). Two nested case-control studies will be performed. The objective of the first study will be to define individual level of risk related to specific antibiotics. Patients acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (cases) will be compared with patients not acquiring antibiotic-resistant strains after starting antibiotic therapy (controls; ratio 1:4).

Meconium FAEE testing can potentially be used as a screen by health-care professionals to identify neonates at-risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, thereby permitting diagnostic follow-up of these children and early intervention in those who develop disabilities. The purpose of this study was to assess whether women would willingly partake in a screening program of this nature. This was determined by launching a pilot screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure in a high-risk obstetric unit previously shown to have a high prevalence of FAEE-positive meconium via anonymous meconium testing. The program involved voluntary testing of meconium for FAEEs and long-term developmental follow-up of positive cases through an existing public health program. The participation rate in the screening program was significantly lower than when testing was conducted anonymously (78% vs. 95%, respectively; p < 0.05), and the positivity rate was 3% in contrast to 30% observed under anonymous conditions (p < 0.001). These low rates suggest that the majority of mothers who consumed alcohol in pregnancy refused to participate. We conclude that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent, likely due to fear, embarrassment, and guilt, may limit the effectiveness of meconium testing for population-based open screening, highlighting the need for public education and social marketing efforts for such programs to be of benefit.",

			"abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a unique autoimmune disorder in which the genetic factors (DQ2/DQ8) and the environmental trigger (gluten) are known and necessary but not sufficient for its development. Other environmental components contributing to CD are poorly understood. Studies suggest that aspects of gluten intake might influence the risk of CD occurrence and timing of its onset, i.e., the amount and quality of ingested gluten, together with the pattern of infant feeding and the age at which gluten is introduced in the diet. In this study, we hypothesize that the intestinal microbiota as a whole rather than specific infections dictates the switch from tolerance to immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Using a sample of infants genetically at risk of CD, we characterized the longitudinal changes in the microbial communities that colonize infants from birth to 24 months and the impact of two patterns of gluten introduction (early vs. late) on the gut microbiota and metabolome, and the switch from gluten tolerance to immune response, including onset of CD autoimmunity. We show that infants genetically susceptible to CD who are exposed to gluten early mount an immune response against gluten and develop CD autoimmunity more frequently than at-risk infants in which gluten exposure is delayed until 12 months of age. The data, while derived from a relatively small number of subjects, suggest differences between the developing microbiota of infants with genetic predisposition for CD and the microbiota from infants with a non-selected genetic background, with an overall lack of bacteria of the phylum Bacteriodetes along with a high abundance of Firmicutes and microbiota that do not resemble that of adults even at 2 years of age. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis reveals potential biomarkers for the prediction of CD. This study constitutes a definite proof-of-principle that these combined genomic and metabolomic approaches will be key to deciphering the role of the gut microbiota on CD onset.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of supplementation of an infant formula with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on select groups of intestinal bacteria in term infants. METHODS: Four groups of infants were enrolled and fed human milk, a commercially available milk-based infant formula, or infant formula supplemented with 2.0 or 3.0 g/L FOS. Dietary intake, stool, and tolerance events were recorded. Fresh stool samples were collected approximately 27 days after feeding the diets (approximately 32 days after birth). Total bacteria, Bacteroides (as commensal bacteria), Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli were quantified using respective specific real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: The formula feeding groups did not differ in stool consistency and stool frequency or frequency of spit-up or vomit during the entire study. The formula-fed infants tended to have more total bacteria in their stool samples than the human milk-fed infants. The formula-fed infants harbored a greater abundance of C difficile and E coli than the human milk-fed infants, but had a similar abundance of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus. The FOS supplementation at either dose did not significantly increase the bifidobacterial or lactobacilli populations, or decrease the populations of C difficile, E coli, or Bacteroides. CONCLUSIONS: The milk-based formula used in this study supported bifidobacterial and lactobacilli populations comparable with the human milk group; however, this formula did not suppress E coli or C difficile as effectively as human milk.",

Thirty minutes after meconium/saline instillation, meconium-instilled animals were treated by intravenous olprinone (0.2 mg/kg) or were left without treatment. All animals were oxygen-ventilated for an additional 5 h. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the left lungs was performed and differential leukocyte count in the sediment was estimated. The right lungs were used to determine lung edema by wet/dry weight ratio, as well as to detect oxidative damage to the lungs. In the lung tissue homogenate, total antioxidant status (TAS) was determined. In isolated lung mitochondria, the thiol group content, conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), dityrosine, lysine-lipid peroxidation products, and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) were estimated. To evaluate the effects of meconium instillation and olprinone treatment on the systemic level, TBARS and TAS were determined in the blood plasma, as well. Meconium instillation increased the relative numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils in the BAL fluid, increased edema formation and concentrations of oxidation markers, and decreased TAS. Treatment with olprinone reduced the numbers of polymorphonuclears in the BAL fluid, decreased the formation of most oxidation markers in the lungs, reduced lung edema and prevented a decrease in TAS in the lung homogenate compared to non-treated animals. In the blood plasma, olprinone decreased TBARS and increased TAS compared to the non-treated group. Conclusion, the selective PDE3 inhibitor olprinone has shown potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in the meconium-induced oxidative lung injury.",

			"abstract": "Much has been learned in recent years about the mechanisms by which breastfeeding improves child health and survival. However, there has been little progress in using these insights to improve pediatric care. The aim of this study was to review all clinical studies of lactoferrin (LF) in children in an effort to determine which interventions may improve pediatric care or require further research. We conducted a systematic and critical review of published literature and found 19 clinical studies that have used human or bovine LF for different outcomes: iron metabolisms and anemia (6 studies), fecal flora (5 studies), enteric infections (3 studies), common pediatric illnesses (1 study), immunomodulation (3 studies), and neonatal sepsis (1 study). Although the efficacies have varied in each trial, the main finding of all published studies is the safety of the intervention. Protection against enteric infections and neonatal sepsis are the most likely biologically relevant activities of LF in children. Future studies on neonatal sepsis should answer critically important questions. If the data from these sepsis studies are proven to be correct, it will profoundly affect the treatment of low birth weight neonates and will aid in the reduction of child mortality worldwide.",

In this research, the development of the fecal microbiota of a group of exclusively breastfed neonates living in low socio-economic conditions in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, during the first month of life, was studied. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from ten neonates on the second, seventh, and 30(th) days after birth. One of the neonates underwent antibiotic therapy. Molecular techniques were used for analysis; DNA was extracted from the samples, and 16S rRNA libraries were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed after construction. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the samples taken from the 30(th) day to amplify DNA from Bifidobacterium sp. RESULTS: The primary phylogenetic groups identified in the samples were Escherichia and Clostridium. Staphylococcus was identified at a low rate. Bifidobacterium sp. was detected in all of the samples collected on the 30(th) day. In the child who received antibiotics, a reduction in anaerobes and Escherichia, which was associated with an overgrowth of Klebsiella, was observed throughout the experimental period. CONCLUSION: The observed pattern of Escherichia predominance and reduced Staphylococcus colonization is in contrast with the patterns observed in neonates living in developed countries.",

Laboratory-based surveillance for non-typhoidal Salmonella infection was conducted in Guangdong Province, China to improve understanding about the disease burden and detection of dispersed outbreaks. Salmonella isolated from patients with diarrhea were sent from 16 sentinel hospitals to local public health laboratories for confirmation, serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE patterns were analyzed to identify clusters representing potential outbreaks. Between September 2009 and October 2010, 352 (4%) Salmonella isolates were obtained from 9167 stool specimens. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (45%) and Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (13%) were the most common serotypes, and multidrug resistance was high, especially in Salmonella Typhimurium isolates. PFGE patterns of obtained Salmonella isolates were found to be diverse, but a unique PFGE pattern comprising 53 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were found to occur almost exclusively in infants. Epidemiologic studies are ongoing to determine whether a common exposure is the source of the Salmonella Typhimurium strain frequently isolated from infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are few reports on the symptoms of rotavirus infections in neonates. This study aims to describe clinical signs of rotavirus infections among neonates, with a particular focus on preterm infants, and to show the distribution of genotypes in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at a regional NICU for 1 year. Stool specimens from every infant in the NICU were collected on admission, at weekly intervals, and from infants showing symptoms. Rotavirus antigens were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and genotypes were confirmed by Reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The infants were divided into three groups: symptomatic preterm infants with and without rotavirus-positive stools [Preterm(rota+) and Preterm(rota-), respectively] and symptomatic full- or near-term infants with rotavirus-positive stools [FT/NT(rota+)]. Demographic and outcome data were compared among these groups. RESULTS: A total of 702 infants were evaluated for rotaviruses and 131 infants were included in this study. The prevalence of rotavirus infections was 25.2%. Preterm(rota+) differed from Preterm(rota-) and FT/NT(rota+) with respect to frequent feeding difficulty (p = 0.047 and 0.034, respectively) and higher percentage of neutropenia (p = 0.008 and 0.011, respectively). G4P[6] was the exclusive strain in both the Preterm(rota+) (97.7%) and FT/NT(rota+) (90.2%), and it was the same for nosocomial, institutional infections, and infections acquired at home. CONCLUSION: Systemic illness signs such as feeding difficulty and neutropenia are specific for preterm infants with rotavirus infections. G4P[6] was exclusive, regardless of preterm birth or locations of infections. This study might be helpful in developing policies for management and prevention of rotavirus infections in NICUs.",

			"article_name": "Neonatal intensive care practices and the influence on skin condition.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premature skin has a thinner epidermis with a poorly formed stratum corneum (SC) barrier compared to full term skin. Poor skin integrity increases the risk of exposure to irritants and infectious agents. Interventions that facilitate skin maturation are essential. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effects of prematurity and time from birth on SC maturation and to identify factors that impact skin condition. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted among 130 NICU patients. Skin regions were evaluated for erythema, rash, integrity and function. The effects of gestational age, time from birth, stool exposure, nutrition and diagnosis were examined. RESULTS: Three groups emerged: (i) premature and <38 weeks adjusted age; (ii) premature and >38 weeks adjusted age; and (iii) full term. Surprisingly, the premature infants exhibited lower perineal irritation and greater SC integrity (lower transepidermal water loss) than full terms (P < 0.05). Group 2 had a longer time before the first skin-stool contact. Chest skin pH showed maturational changes for Group 1 (P < 0.05) but did not change for premature Group 2 who was older at enrollment. Erythema was lower for infants using elemental formulas or total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants with early stool contact and high exposure, full term infants, and patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia or trisomy 21 are at high risk for skin compromise and may benefit from prophylactic interventions to minimize compromise. Low stool exposure and greater time before the first stool contact appear to be protective against skin compromise.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vaccination is the most effective preventive strategy against rotavirus disease. Regional differences in prevalent rotavirus genotypes may affect vaccine efficacy. Pre-vaccine surveillance for burden of rotavirus disease, prevalent rotavirus genotypes, and association between rotavirus disease and intussusceptions helps in monitoring the impact of vaccination. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was conducted from January 2008 to December 2009 in children younger than five years hospitalized for longer than 24 hours with acute gastroenteritis. Data on confirmed cases of intussusception were collected retrospectively. Stools were tested by enzyme immunoassay, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing.  RESULTS: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused 13.1% (2,147/16,348) of hospitalizations among children under five years. Stools were tested for 50.2% (1077/2147) of AGE cases. Of these, 49% (528/1077) were rotavirus positive. Rotavirus gastroenteritis, non-rotavirus gastroenteritis, and intussusceptions were most prevalent in children under 15 months [80.3%, 74% and 91% respectively]. Rotavirus was detected from more than 60% of acute gastroenteritis cases during peak months. The prevalence of intussusception showed no seasonal pattern. The peak ages of six to twelve months for acute gastroenteritis and five to eight months for intussusception overlapped. G1, G2 and mixed G/P genotypes were common in the isolated rotaviruses. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus gastroenteritis causes significant morbidity in children younger than five years of age in Ghana. Although the peak age of rotavirus gastroenteritis and intussusceptions overlapped, there was no seasonal correlation between them. The high prevalence of mixed G/P genotypes in Ghanaian children may affect the effectiveness of vaccination.",

The main objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of HPeVs infection in hospitalized patients in a period of 2 years. Respiratory samples from 3,525 patients with respiratory syndrome, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 340 patients with neurologic syndrome as well as CSF and plasma samples from five neonatal patients with sepsis-like illness collected from October 2008 to 2010 were tested retrospectively using HPeV-specific real-time RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of VP3/VP1 region was performed on the positive samples. Fourteen out of 3,525 (0.4%) patients with respiratory syndrome and five out of five patients with sepsis-like illness were positive for HPeV. In 3/5 patients with sepsis-like illness multiple samples (e.g., stool, plasma, CSF, or respiratory samples) were available, and HPeV was found in all specimens. In contrast, no positive CSF was detected among the 340 patients with neurologic syndromes. Eleven patients (57.9%) were infected with HPeV1 strain, 7 (36.8%) with HPeV3, and 1 (5.3%) with HPeV6 strains. Ten of the 14 HPeV patients with respiratory syndrome were co-infected with other respiratory viruses (eight with rhinovirus and two with coronavirus OC43). All five patients with sepsis-like illness were less than 1 month of age and were infected with HPeV3. Although not circulating at high frequency and unlikely to cause respiratory syndrome, HPeV was associated with severe clinical syndromes in a minority of newborns.",

In order to provide more insights into the epidemiology of enteric viruses that are not included usually in routine diagnostic tests, cases of childhood sporadic gastroenteritis of unknown etiology requiring hospital admission in Parma, Italy, during 2008-2009, were screened for astrovirus (AstV), sapovirus (SaV), and bocavirus (BoV). The stools of 712 children, negative for rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and reovirus, were examined by PCR or RT-PCR for AstV, BoV, and SaV. The prevalence of AstV, BoV, and SaV in the patients examined was 2.1%, 3.2%, 2.4%, respectively, with the viruses being detected mostly in children <3 years of age. AstV strains were characterized by sequencing as types 1, 2, and 4, with a AstV-1 peak occurring in the 2008 fall-winter season. BoV strains were characterized as types 1, 2, and 3, with BoV-3 circulating more frequently in the 2008 autumn and winter season and BoV-2 during March-April 2009. The most common SaVs were GI.2 and GII.1 while GIV and GV SaVs were detected sporadically. Overall, AstV, BoV, and SaV infections accounted for 7.7% of the sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis with unknown etiology selected for the study. Different virus types and lineages were found to circulate and temporal peaks of virus activity were also demonstrated, suggesting either small clusters of infections or small outbreaks or epidemics in local population.",

BACKGROUND: CDI is a major challenge in health care due to its frequent occurrence and high associated costs. Enzyme immunoassay and PCR are commonly performed diagnostic tests for CDI. METHODS: Our microbiology laboratory database was queried from January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2010 for all patients who underwent PCR stool testing for suspected CDI. Data collected included age, sex, number of stool tests performed within a 14-day period after the first test, and location of patient (inpatient vs. outpatient). Analyses were performed using JMP version 9.0.1. RESULTS: PCR testing was performed in 15,515 patients. The median age was 58.3 years (range, 10 d to 104.3 y) and 46.2% of patients were women. Repeat testing was infrequent; 87.3% of patients had testing performed only once in a 14-day period. Increased age, male sex, and inpatient location were predictors of repeat testing. The median time between an initial test and the first repeat test was 5 days. After an initial negative test, the percentage of patients having a subsequent positive test was low (2.7% in 7 d and 3.2% in 14 d). The percentage of repeat tests that was positive within 7 days (2.9%) was lower than the percentage that was positive from day 8 to day 14 (4.8%, P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat testing for C. difficile has a low yield, and patients with an initial negative test should not routinely be retested.",

In Germany, incidence of reported yersiniosis is relatively high compared with other countries of the European Union. Children aged <5 years are most frequently affected. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for sporadic yersiniosis in Germany. A population-based case-control study was conducted in five federal states of Germany from April 2009 to June 2010. Cases exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms were notified to the local health department with a Yersinia enterocolitica infection culture-confirmed from stool. Controls were selected from population registries and frequency-matched on age group and state of residency. Cases and controls received a questionnaire on possible risk factors by mail. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to identify risk factors and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs). Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were estimated for exposures associated with yersiniosis. We analysed data on 571 case patients and 1798 controls. Consumption of raw minced pork, a dish frequently consumed even by young children in Germany, was the main risk factor for disease (aOR 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-6.3, PAF 30%).

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Infancy represents a window of development during which long-term immunological functioning can be influenced. In this study, we evaluate proxies of microbial exposures in infancy as predictors of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in young adulthood. IL-4 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that plays a role in the pathogenesis of atopic and allergic diseases. METHODS: Data were obtained from 1,403 participants in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, an ongoing population-based study in the Philippines. Relationships between microbial and nutritional environments in infancy and plasma IL-4 concentrations in adulthood were evaluated using tobit regression models. RESULTS: Having older siblings and more episodes of respiratory illness in infancy significantly predicted lower concentrations of plasma IL-4 in adulthood. Unexpectedly, more episodes of diarrheal illness in infancy were associated with higher IL-4 in adulthood. Interactions between a composite household pathogen exposure score and the duration of exclusive breastfeeding approached significance. This interaction showed that the negative association between household pathogen exposure in infancy and adult IL-4 was only significant for individuals who had been exclusively breastfed for a short duration of time. Finally, currently living in an urban household was unexpectedly, negatively associated with adult IL-4. Associations were independent of early nutrition, socioeconomic status (SES), and urbanicity, as well as current measures of infection, body fat, SES, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: This study builds on a growing body of literature demonstrating that early ecological conditions have long-term effects on human biology by providing evidence that multiple proxies of microbial exposures in infancy are associated with adult IL-4.",

			"article_name": "Clostridia in premature neonates' gut: incidence, antibiotic susceptibility, and perinatal determinants influencing colonization.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although premature neonates (PN) gut microbiota has been studied, data about gut clostridial colonization in PN are scarce. Few studies have reported clostridia colonization in PN whereas Bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. Such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. Besides, PN are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. The aim of this study was to report the distribution of Clostridium species isolated in feces from PN and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 76 PN followed until hospital discharge in three French neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 79% were colonized by clostridia. Clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. Antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except C. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. However, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10 days) antibiotic courses (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). Besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the NICU (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: This study shows that clostridia are part of the PN gut microbiota. It provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in PN showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules. Thus, the high prevalence of this genus is not linked to a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents or to the use of antibiotics in NICUs. The main perinatal determinant influencing PN clostridia colonization appears to be the NICU environment.",

Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) were used as sample preparation techniques. The analytes were detected by gas-chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. The limits of detection were 3.0 and 30 ng/g for cotinine and nicotine, respectively. The method showed good linearity (r(2) > 0.98) in the concentration range studied (LOQ-500 ng/g). The intraday precision, given by the RSD of the method, was less than 15% for cotinine and nicotine. The method proved to be fast, practical, and sensitive. Smaller volumes of organic solvents are necessary compared to other chromatographic methods published in the scientific literature.

The risk of NEC decreased by 8% with each additional day of gestational age. DISCUSSION: Typically, very few bacterial species could be cultured from the fecal specimens obtained. Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria dominated the samples in the NEC group, whereas in the control group mixed flora of G(+) and Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria were isolated. Surprisingly, molecular analysis using PCR-DGGE profiles did not confirm these differences. Our data suggest that G(+) bacteria in the intestine may play a role in the development of NEC in premature infants. METHODS: One hundred and sixty three neonates born at <30 weeks of gestation were enrolled. Fecal samples taken during the first month of life were subjected to culture and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). A total of 482 fecal samples were examined.",

			"abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) develops in 5-10% of preterm infants in association with enteral feeding and bacterial colonization. It remains unclear how diet and bacteria interact to protect or provoke the immature gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the factors that control bacterial colonization may provide the clue to prevent NEC, and studies in infants must be combined with animal models to understand the mechanisms of the microbiota-epithelium interactions. Analyses of infant fecal samples show that the density and distribution of bacterial species are highly variable with no consistent effects of gestational age, delivery mode, diet or probiotic administration, while low bacterial diversity and bacterial overgrowth are commonly associated with NEC. A series of recent studies in preterm pigs show that the mucosa-associated microbiota is affected by delivery method, prematurity and NEC progression and that diet has limited effects. Overgrowth of specific groups (e.g. Clostridia) appears to be a consequence of NEC, rather than the cause of NEC. Administration of probiotics either decreases or increases NEC sensitivity in preterm pigs, while in preterm infants probiotics have generally decreased NEC incidence and overall mortality. The optimal nature and amount of probiotic bacteria are unknown and host defense factors appear more important for NEC sensitivity than the nature of the gut microbiota. Host defense is improved by feeding the optimal amount of enteral diets, such as mother's colostrum or milk, that help the immature intestinal immune system to respond appropriately to the highly variable bacterial colonization.",

The results of this work confirm the presence of the same specific bacterial strains of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Staphylococcus in breast milk and infant fecal samples. The identity of bacteria isolated from breast milk and infant feces from 20 mother-infant pairs was investigated at the strain level. DNA from Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium was detected by qRTi-PCR in nearly all samples analyzed. These samples were cultured on different agar media. One colony representative of each morphology was selected and identified at the species level combining classical tests and molecular techniques (PCR, RAPD, PFGE, and/or MLST genotyping). Breast milk and infant feces from 19 mother-infant pairs shared different Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, and/or Bifidobacterium species and strains. Significantly, 2 mother-infant pairs shared 4 bacterial strains although most pairs shared 2. These results confirm that breast milk and infant feces from mother-infant pairs share the same strain(s), indicating that breastfeeding could contribute to the bacterial transfer from the mother to the infant and, therefore, to the infant gut colonization.",

Because of sequence similarity between 5'-NCR of HRVs and enteroviruses (EVs), it is problematic to design EV-specific RT-PCR assays. The aims of this study were to assess the rate of false-detection of different rhinoviruses by EV RT-PCR, and to evaluate the diagnostic and clinical significance of such cross-reactivity. In vitro RNA transcripts of HRV A-C created from cDNA templates were quantified spectrophotometrically. Six hundred twenty-one stool samples screened as part of routine diagnostic for EV, 17 EV-positive stool samples referred for typing, 288 stool samples submitted for gastroenteritis investigations, and 1,500 CSF samples were included in the study. EV-specific RT-PCR detected RNA transcripts of HRV-A1b, HRV-B14, and HRV-Crpat18 but with 10-1,000 reduced sensitivity compared to EV transcripts. Screening fecal samples by EV RT-PCR identified 13 positive samples identified subsequently as rhinoviruses; a further 26 HRV-positive samples were identified by nested HRV RT-PCR. All individuals were hospitalized and presented mostly with diarrhea. A total of 26 HRV types were identified (HRV-A: 46%; HRV-B: 13%; HRV-C: 41%). Results confirm that EV-specific RT-PCR can detect HRVs, and at a practical level, identify potential problems of interpretation if fecal samples are used for surrogate screening in cases of suspected viral meningitis. High detection frequencies (10%) and viral loads in stool samples provide evidence for enteric replication of HRV, and its association with enteric disease requires further etiological studies.",

Salmonella incidence fell from 43 to 19 episodes/100 000 population but Campylobacter incidence after declining from 111/100 000 in 1998 to 84/100 000 in 2003 rose to 119/100 000 in 2008. The proportion of the population sampled rose from 2.0% in 1998 to 2.8% in 2008, mostly due to increases in samples from hospital patients and older adults. The proportion of positive samples declined for both Salmonella and Campylobacter from 3.1% to 1.1% and from 8.9% to 7.5%, respectively. The decline in Salmonella incidence is so substantial that it is not masked even by increased stool sampling, but the recent rise in Campylobacter incidence may be a surveillance artefact largely due to the increase in stool sampling in older people.",

The study included all children younger than 14 years of age treated for enteritis at Heraklion University General Hospital on the island of Crete during the 18-year period from January 1993 to December 2010. Stool specimens were tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Yersinia, and Aeromonas species. Of the 33,032 stool samples from patients of any age, 2,912 (8.82%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. The 1,597 isolates from children were identified as S. enterica (42.3%), Campylobacter spp. (33.6%), EPEC (17.4%), Y. enterocolitica (5.82%), A. hydrophila (0.44%), and Shigella spp. (0.38%). A decline in prevalence was observed for all bacterial enteropathogens. Taken as a total, enteropathogens were susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin in 98.8%, 88.0%, 83.0%, 67.1%, and 59.6%, respectively. During the study period, the susceptibility rates decreased for co-trimoxazole (p<0.0001) and ciprofloxacin (p<0.001), and increased for amoxicillin (p<0.0001). Our findings suggest declining long-term trends in the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens and changes in susceptibility rates to first-line antibacterial agents.

METHODS: During 2005-2006, all stool virology performed for isolated digestive symptoms or suspicion of neonatal infection was tested for HAstV by an amplified enzyme-linked immunoassay (IDEIA Astrovirus test, Dako Cytomation). Each newborn with a positive result (HAstV+ group) was retrospectively matched with the first following symptomatic newborn in the same care unit having a negative stool virology (HAstV- group). Clinical data were collected during two 3-day periods (just after faecal samples collection and 1 week before) and compared within and between each group. RESULTS: Human astrovirus was detected in faeces of 68 newborns [gestational age: 31.4(28.8-34) weeks] at a post-natal age of 23 (15-42) days without seasonal dominance.

However, in this report we sited the epidemiological reflect coming from our project. METHODS: One thousand and seven diarrheal stool samples had been collected between Jan 1st, 2008 and OCT 31st, 2010 from hospitalized patients below the age of 5 year. Samples were then examined using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Demographic data were collected including age, sex, date of admission and discharge. Finally, the chi-squire test, alpha level of significance was used to test the variables in the data. RESULTS: Of these 1007 stool samples, rotavirus was detected in 65.5% (660/1007 samples). We observed that children who are 1 year of age or less had more infection with rotavirus 81% (534/660) than those who is over 1 year of age (19%,126/660) (P = 0.000). Infections occur throughout the year with no clear significant seasonal peaks. The difference between males (57.5%, 380/660) and females (42.4%, 280/660) in terms of rotavirus positivity is statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of positivity, are at variance with previously published reports of rotavirus infection in Saudi Arabia since 2005 which reported a major decrease year by year in the incidence of rotavirus over; 2005, 2006 and 2008 with percentage of; 25%, 10%, 6% respectively explained by improvements in public health introduced in recent years.

A randomized double blinded controlled study including healthy infants was conducted. One month aged infants received a prebiotic infant formula supplemented with L. fermentum (experimental group) or the same formula without the probiotic strain (control group) for 5 months. The primary outcome of the study was average daily weight gain between baseline and 4 months of age. Secondary outcomes were other anthropometric data (length and head circumference), formula consumption, and tolerance. Incidence of infections was also recorded by pediatricians. No significant differences in weight gain were observed between both groups, neither at 4 months of age (29.0+/-7.8 vs 28.9+/-5.7g/day) nor at 6 months (25.1+/-6.1 vs 24.7+/-5.2g/day). There were no statistically significant differences in the consumption of the formulae or symptoms related to the tolerance of the formula. The incidence rate of gastrointestinal infections in infants of the control group was 3 times higher than in the probiotic group (p=0.018). Therefore, consumption of a prebiotic infant formula enriched with the human milk probiotic strain L. fermentum CECT5716 from 1 to 6 months of life is well tolerated and safe. Furthermore, the consumption of this formula may improve the health of the infants by reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal infections.",

The aim of the study was to assess the tolerance and safety of a formula containing an innovative mixture of oligosaccharides in early infancy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: this study was performed as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including healthy term infants. Infants were recruited before the age of 8 weeks, either having started with formula feeding or being fully breast-fed (breastfeeding group). Formula-fed infants were randomized to feeding with a regular formula containing a mixture of neutral oligosaccharides and pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides (prebiotic formula group) or regular formula without oligosaccharides (control formula group). Growth, tolerance and adverse events were assessed at 8, 16, 24 and 52 weeks of age. The prebiotic and control groups showed similar mean weight, length and head circumference, skin fold thicknesses, arm circumference gains and stool frequency at each study point. As far as the anthropometric parameters are concerned, the prebiotic group and the control group did not attain the values shown by the breastfeeding group at any study point. The skin fold thicknesses assessed in the breastfeeding group at 8 weeks were strikingly larger than those in formula fed infants, whereas at 52 weeks were strikingly smaller. The stool consistency in the prebiotic group was softer than in the control group at 8, 16 and 24 weeks (p<0.001) and closer to that of the breastfeeding group. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two formula groups.

The profile of intestinal microbiota in the full-term, vaginally delivered, breast-fed infant is considered as ideally healthy. However, in preterm infants this process is challenging, mainly because of organ immaturity, antibiotics use, and hospital stay. To assist in a proper microbiota development in these infants, a detailed knowledge of the colonization process, and the differences from that of full-term breast-fed infants, is needed. We assessed the establishment of the gut microbiota and its metabolic activity in preterm neonates (n = 21) during the first 3 months of life and compared it with that of vaginally delivered, exclusively breast-fed full-term infants (n = 20) using qualitative and quantitative culture-independent methods. Differences in the gut microbiota composition between both groups were observed. Preterm infants showed higher levels of facultative anaerobic microorganisms and reduced levels of strict anaerobes such as Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Atopobium. Short-chain fatty acids concentrations were lower in preterm infants during the first days of life. Alterations occur in the process of microbiota establishment in preterm infants, indicating the need for intervention strategies to counteract them.",

In November 2007, a gastroenteritis outbreak due to faecal contamination of tap water took place in a Finnish town. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of joint symptoms after the outbreak. METHODS: The authors conducted a controlled, population-based questionnaire survey to study the occurrence of joint symptoms within 8 weeks after the exposure. The survey covered three areas: contaminated and uncontaminated parts of the town and a control town. A total of 1000 residents were randomly selected from each area, and the joint symptoms were first analysed separately and thereafter categorized as arthritis-like if joint swelling, redness, warmth or pain in movement was reported. RESULTS: A total of 2123 responses could be evaluated. The overall prevalence of joint symptoms was 13.9% in the contaminated group, 4.3% in the uncontaminated group and 1.5% among the control group, and the frequency of arthritis-like symptoms in the groups was 6.7, 2.1 and 0.5%, respectively.

Antibiotic administration reduces symptoms of pouchitis, indicating that bacteria have a role in pathogenesis. The aim of the research was to investigate the bacterial content of pouches using nucleic acid-based methods. METHODS: Stool microbiota of 17 patients with normal pouches (NP), 17 patients with pouchitis (CP) utilizing samples collected from each patient when antibiotic-treated (CP-on, asymptomatic) and when untreated (CP-off, symptomatic), and 14 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization technologies, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed an expanded phylogenetic gap in NP and CP-off patients relative to FAP. Antibiotic treatment reduced the gap in CP stool. The phylogenetic gap of CP-off patients was due to members of the bacterial families Caulobacteriaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae. There was a greater diversity of phylotypes of Clostridiaceae in CP-off subjects. The phylogenetic gap of NP stool was enriched by Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae. CP stool microbiota had reduced diversity relative to NP and FAP stool due largely to a reduction in Lachnospiraceae/Insertae Sedis XIV/clostridial cluster IV groups. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial groups within the expanded phylogenetic gap of pouch patients may have roles in the pathogenesis of pouchitis. Further research concerning the physiology of cultured members of these groups will be necessary to explain their specific roles. Members of the Lachnospiraceae, Incertae Sedis XIV, and clostridial cluster IV could be useful biomarkers of pouch health.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnourished children are at increased risk for death due to diarrhea. Our goal was to determine the contribution of specific enteric infections to malnutrition-associated diarrhea and to determine the role of enteric infections in the development of malnutrition. METHODS: Children from an urban slum in Bangladesh were followed for the first year of life by every-other-day home visits. Enteropathogens were identified in diarrheal and monthly surveillance stools; intestinal barrier function was measured by serum endocab antibodies; and nutritional status was measured by anthropometry. RESULTS: Diarrhea occurred 4.69 +/- 0.19 times per child per year, with the most common infections caused by enteric protozoa (amebiasis, cryptosporidiosis, and giardiasis), rotavirus, astrovirus, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Malnutrition was present in 16.3% of children at birth and 42.4% at 12 months of age. Children malnourished at birth had increased Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium, and ETEC infections and more severe diarrhea. Children who became malnourished by 12 months of age were more likely to have prolonged diarrhea, intestinal barrier dysfunction, a mother without education, and low family expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective observation of infants in an urban slum demonstrated that diarrheal diseases were associated with the development of malnutrition that was in turn linked to intestinal barrier disruption and that diarrhea was more severe in already malnourished children. The enteric protozoa were unexpectedly important causes of diarrhea in this setting. This study demonstrates the complex interrelationship of malnutrition and diarrhea in infants in low-income settings and points to the potential for infectious disease interventions in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early detection of necrotizing enterocolitis can improve the prognosis, however, there is not a reliable laboratory test to detect either newborns at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis development or those at early stages of the disease. Since fecal lactoferrin and fecal calprotectin are inflammatory markers of gastrointestinal diseases, it was hypothesized that both these biomarkers could be successfully used in the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. METHODS: In a prospective study, fecal lactoferrin and fecal calprotectin concentrations of 14 newborns with necrotizing enterocolitis and consecutively admitted 40 healthy preterm, and 23 healthy full-term newborns were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. RESULTS: Mean fecal lactoferrin and fecal calprotectin were not different between preterm and full-term newborns (p = .235 and p = .845, respectively), or those who were diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis or not (p = .545 and p = .968, respectively). Prevalence of necrotizing enterocolitis was 1.51% (14 of 2734). Stage of the disease did not have a statistical effect on mean levels (p = .694 and p = .267, respectively). Mean fecal lactoferrin and fecal calprotectin levels were not different in the case of breastfeeding (p = .623 and p = .792, respectively). CONCLUSION: Neither fecal lactoferrin nor fecal calprotectin has a role in the identification of necrotizing enterocolitis, especially in early stages of the disease. Further studies on wider necrotizing enterocolitis series are needed for a more definite conclusion.",

A total of ninety-seven non-breastfed term neonates were enrolled into a double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in which they received experimental (n 48) or standard formula (n 49) for 6 months. The primary outcome was weight at 6 months of age. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal tolerance and manifestation of atopic dermatitis. Faecal secretory IgA (SIgA) concentration and microbiota composition of forty-three infants were analysed at 1 and 6 months. Growth was similar in both groups. At 1 month, compared to those in the control group, infants in the experimental group exhibited less crying or agitation, and more quiet behaviour (P=0.03). At 6 months, atopic dermatitis was less frequently observed in the experimental group (P<0.05). Decrease of faecal SIgA concentration between 1 and 6 months was mainly observed in the control group. This decrease was significantly associated with atopic dermatitis (P<0.014) and negatively correlated to the level of colonisation by bifidobacteria (P<0.005). In conclusion, compared to the control formula, the experimental formula guaranteed a similar growth, was better tolerated at 1 month and had a protective effect against the development of atopic dermatitis.",

We undertook such a study in a Nordic country. Patients of all age groups who had acute diarrhea were recruited prospectively from general practice clinics in Iceland. They completed a questionnaire and provided stool samples for the detection of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Of the 464 recruited patients, 211 (45%) had 224 infections. The most common pathogens were calici- and rotaviruses (23% and 18% of 224 infections, respectively), Campylobacter jejuni (17%), Cryptosporidium species (12%), and Salmonella serotypes (10%). Other agents found were Giardia lamblia, astro- and adenoviruses, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Viral pathogens were associated with vomiting, illness for </=7 days, and younger age groups, while bacterial pathogens were associated with fever, rectal pain, and local or foreign travel, and parasitic pathogens with illness for >7 days. Detection rates for viral infections in the elderly and for Cryptosporidium species were higher than expected. Our study indicates the existence of regional differences in pathogen prevalence that should be taken into account when implementing guidelines for stool testing in patients with acute diarrheal disease.",

This double blinded randomized control trial compared the stool of bottle fed preterms, randomized to receive lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) 6x109or placebo with formula feeding. STUDY DESIGN: 46 enterally fed preterms were randomized to receive probiotics or placebo within 0-3days after birth. All personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. Faecal sampling was preformed at day 7, 21, 42. Presence of LGG colonization, somatic growth and length of hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS: 60 patients were initially identified and enrolled but after exclusion criteria were applied, 21 babies were analyzed in the probiotic group and 26 in the placebo group. The number of lactobacillus were significantly higher (p=0.014) on day 7, and 21 (p=0.024) in the study group, and so was the number of enterobacteriaceae on all study days (p=0.004, p=0.000, p=0.000), and Enterococcus sp on day 21 (p=0.000). The amount of samples positive for staphylococci was significantly higher in the study group, on days 7 and 42 (p=0.001 and 0.011).

METHOD: The sample consisted of 270 pregnant women (189 smokers, 81 nonsmokers) recruited into a prospective study of prenatal cigarette exposure in the first trimester. Persistent pregnancy smoking was defined as self-reporting daily smoking in at least two trimesters, a positive salivary cotinine level in at least two trimesters, or infant meconium positive for nicotine and/ or its metabolites. RESULTS: Persistent smokers reported higher prenatal stress and negative affect symptoms (depression, anger, hostility, aggression) than nonpersistent smokers or nonsmokers. However, in the context of model testing, maternal anger, hostility, and aggression each accounted for unique variance in persistent smoking, whereas symptoms of depression and stress did not. CONCLUSIONS: To date, interventions for pregnant low-income smokers have been largely ineffective. The current results suggest that anger management interventions may be particularly effective for low-income persistent pregnant smokers and may be more likely to prevent relapse than depression-focused interventions.",

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of stool color card screening by using claims data from the National Health Insurance Research Database. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data from medical charts of all inpatients who were diagnosed with biliary atresia from 1996 to 2008 were collected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who received a Kasai operation or liver transplant were identified by the Operation code. The patients' gender, age at admission, and type of operation were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2008, the overall incidence of biliary atresia was 1.48 per 10,000 live births. The median age at first admission for patients with suspected biliary atresia decreased after the implementation of stool color card screening (47 vs 43 days). The proportion of very late referral decreased from 9.5% to 4.9%. The median age of Kasai operation advanced from 51 to 48 days. The proportions of Kasai operation within 60 days of age were 68.9% before and 73.6% after screening program. CONCLUSION: Stool color card screening seemed to increase parents' and physicians' awareness of biliary atresia. It also was associated with a decline in the proportion of late referral. Thus, screening might be especially effective in areas with high a proportion of late referral. Improvements in the speed of workup and the operation room should be the focus of education and training in the future.",

OBJECTIVES: The aims of our study were to identify the incidence and risk factors associated with MO and to review the treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 101 extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWIs) who were born between January 1, 2007, and April 1, 2009, at Seoul National University Hospital. Prenatal and neonatal factors were compared between the MO and control groups. The treatment outcomes were also reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-two (22%) patients were diagnosed as having MO. Eighteen of these patients (82%) had prenatal risk factors for MO. Respiratory distress syndrome was more prevalent in the MO group than in the control group (p = 0.001). Overall, 17 of the 22 patients (77%) were relieved with medical treatment and the rest underwent ileostomy. The times to full enteral feeding did not differ between the medically treated group and the control group. However, the surgically treated group required more time to achieve full enteral feeding, and some patients had persistent gastrointestinal problems. CONCLUSION: MO is not a rare condition in ELBWIs, and the majority of ELBWIs have prenatal risk factors. Medical management was effective, and medically manageable cases had good prognoses for subsequent feeding, whereas some surgically managed cases had persistent gastrointestinal problems.",

Genotype II.4 strains have been the dominant type identified in adults, however the genotype distribution in children is less clearly defined. This study aimed to detect and genotype norovirus strains infecting children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Melbourne, Australia from 2006 to 2008. Stool samples were collected from 272 children admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, with non-rotavirus acute gastroenteritis between April 2006 and December 2008. Using RT-PCR, norovirus was detected in 36% of samples. Strains were genetically characterized via analysis of regions from both the capsid gene and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, to investigate genotype distribution and incidence of recombination. Typing based on the capsid gene (n = 70) detected GII.4 (49%) and GII.3 (46%) as the most predominant genotypes. Strains with a GII.4 capsid were usually assigned a GII.4 RdRp, whereas most strains identified as GII.3 based on capsid typing were assigned a GIIb RdRp (71%). The GII.3/GIIb represent recombinant strains. Sequence analysis of the putative recombination breakpoint was performed for three representative suspected recombinants: GII.3/GIIb (n = 2) and GII.3/GII.12 (n = 1). Recombination analysis confirmed these strains as recombinants and identified putative breakpoints adjacent to the ORF1/ORF2 junction. This study highlights the importance of norovirus infection as a cause of pediatric gastroenteritis. It also reinforces the high circulation of recombinant strains causing disease in children, particularly the GII.3/GIIb strain.",

			"abstract": "Most cases of acute gastroenteritis and foodborne disease are not ascertained by public health surveillance because the ill person does not always seek medical care and submit a stool sample for testing, and the laboratory does not always test for or identify the causative organism. We estimated the total burden of acute gastroenteritis in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, using data from two 2-week cross-sectional, population-based telephone surveys conducted in 2006 and 2007. To estimate the number of acute gastroenteritis illnesses caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Miyagi Prefecture, we determined the number of cases for each pathogen from active laboratory-based surveillance during 2005 to 2006 and adjusted for seeking of medical care and submission of stool specimens by using data from the population-based telephone surveys. Monte Carlo simulation was used to incorporate uncertainty. The prevalence of acute gastroenteritis in the preceding 4 weeks was 3.3% (70 of 2,126) and 3.5% (74 of 2,121) in the winter and summer months, yielding an estimated 44,200 episodes of acute gastroenteritis each year in this region. Among people with acute gastroenteritis, the physician consultation rate was 32.0%, and 10.9% of persons who sought care submitted a stool sample. The estimated numbers of Campylobacter-, Salmonella-, and V. parahaemolyticus -associated episodes of acute gastroenteritis were 1,512, 209, and 100 per 100,000 population per year, respectively, in this region. These estimates are significantly higher than the number of reported cases in surveillance in this region. Cases ascertained from active surveillance were also underrepresented in the present passive surveillance, suggesting that complementary surveillance systems, such as laboratory-based active surveillance in sentinel sites, are needed to monitor food safety in Japan.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim was to describe the feeding- and stooling patterns of infants with colic and evaluate the influence of minimal acupuncture. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled, blind clinical study was conducted at a private acupuncture clinic in Sweden. 90 otherwise healthy 2-8 weeks old infants, born after gestational week 36, fulfilling the criteria for infantile colic and not medicated with dicyclomine, were included. 81 infants went through a structured program consisting of six visits to the clinic, twice weekly. Infants randomized to receive acupuncture were given minimal, standardized acupuncture for two seconds in LI4. Frequency and size of stooling, as well as duration of, and intervals between, feeding sessions were reported by parents in a diary. Parental assessment of sleep and comments on stooling and side effects were collected in a questionnaire. RESULTS: At baseline when the mean age was five weeks, infants in both groups were fed a median of eight times/day, 148 min/day, with considerable variations. No differences were found between groups in the frequency and duration of feeding during the intervention weeks. Furthermore there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the frequency of stooling, neither at baseline, at which point the infants of both groups had bowel movements 4.2 times/day, nor during the intervention weeks. There was an expected decrease in frequency of stooling in both groups, reaching 2.1 (p = 0.001) in the acupuncture group and 3.1 (p < 0.001) in the control group. The groups differed regarding large bowel movements which decreased linearly in the control group (p = 0.011) but not in the acupuncture group (p = 0.787). More parents in the acupuncture group than in the control group (28% and 15% respectively, p = 0.006) experienced the infant's sleep to be \"better\" or \"much better.\" No other significant differences were found. However, parents described a normalized stooling and experienced an improvement in colic in their infants more frequently in the acupuncture group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with colic in the present study had a higher frequency of stooling than reported internationally in healthy infants. Minimal acupuncture had no major effect on feeding, stooling and sleep, although a minor effect of minimal acupuncture on stooling and sleep cannot be ruled out.

Recent studies suggest that avian Escherichia coli commonly possess the ability to resist multiple antimicrobial agents, and might serve as reservoirs of MDR for human extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) and commensal E. coli populations. We determined antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for 2202 human and avian E. coli isolates, then sought for associations among resistance profile, plasmid content, virulence factor profile, and phylogenetic group. Avian-source isolates harbored greater proportions of MDR than their human counterparts, and avian ExPEC had higher proportions of MDR than did avian commensal E. coli. MDR was significantly associated with possession of the IncA/C, IncP1-alpha, IncF, and IncI1 plasmid types. Overall, inferred virulence potential did not correlate with drug susceptibility phenotype. However, certain virulence genes were positively associated with MDR, including ireA, ibeA, fyuA, cvaC, iss, iutA, iha, and afa. According to the total dataset, isolates segregated significantly according to host species and clinical status, thus suggesting that avian and human ExPEC and commensal E. coli represent four distinct populations with limited overlap. These findings suggest that in extraintestinal E. coli, MDR is most commonly associated with plasmids, and that these plasmids are frequently found among avian-source E. coli from poultry production systems.",

In breast-fed infants a trend toward higher counts of bifidobacteria was detected in Finland (p = 0.097) as against Germany, where a more diverse microbiota was reflected in higher Akkermansia (p = 0.003), Clostridium histolyticum (p = 0.035) and Bacteroides-Prevotella (p = 0.027) levels and a higher percentage of Akkermansia (p = 0.004). Finnish LPR + BL999 intervention group (Lactobacillus rhamnosus LPR and Bifidobacterium longum BL999) had higher percentages of fecal Lactobacillus-Enterococcus (9.0% vs. 6.1% placebo, p = 0.003) and lower bifidobacteria levels (10.03 log cells/g vs. 10.68 log cells/g placebo, p = 0.018).

			"article_name": "The molecular epidemiology of circulating rotaviruses: three-year surveillance in the region of Monastir, Tunisia.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe, dehydrating, gastroenteritis among children worldwide. In developing countries, approximately 1440 children die from rotavirus infections each day, with an estimated 527,000 annually. In infants, rotavirus is estimated to cause more than 2 million hospitalizations every year depending on the income level of the country. The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion of rotavirus gastroenteritis and identify the distribution of circulating G and P genotype rotavirus strains among children consulting several dispensaries in the region of Monastir (outpatients departments) or admitted to Monastir University Hospital (inpatients department) with acute gastroenteritis. METHODS: This study was undertaken during a 3-year period from April 2007 to April 2010 in Tunisian children under 13 suffering from acute gastroenteritis. Group A rotaviruses were detected in stools by ELISA and genotyped using multiplex reverse transcription PCRs with type-specific primers on the basis of their outer capsid proteins. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software, version 19. RESULTS: Of the 435 stool samples from children with acute gastroenteritis, 27.6% were positive for rotavirus A. The predominant G type was G1 (37.5%), followed by G3 (25%), G2 (17.5%), G4 (12.5%), G9 (2.5%) and three mixed-G infections G3G4 (2.5%) were identified. Only P[8] (80.8%), P[4] (16.7%) and P[9] (0.8%) genotypes were found. The predominant single G/P combination was G1P[8] (37.5%), followed by G3P[8] (25%), G2P[4] (16.7%), G4P[8] (12.5%), G9P[8] (1.7%) and one case of the unusual combination G9P[9] (0.8%). The G-mixed types G3G4 combined with P[8] (2.5%). Infants less than 3 months of age were most frequently affected. The prevalence of rotavirus infection peaked in the winter season, when temperatures were low, and decreased in summer. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a common disease associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Epidemiological knowledge of rotavirus is critical for the development of effective preventive measures, including vaccines. These data will help to make informed decisions as to whether rotavirus vaccine should be considered for inclusion in Tunisia's National Immunisation Programme.",

In the present study we monitored fecal oligosaccharide profiles together with the HMO-profiles of the respective breast milks up to six months postpartum, by means of capillary electrophoresis-laser induced fluorescence detection and mass spectrometry. Eleven mother/child pairs were included. Mother's secretor- and Lewis-type included all combinations [Le(a-b+), Le(a+b-), Le(a-b-)]. The fecal HMO-profiles in the first few months of life are either predominantly composed of neutral or acidic HMOs and are possibly effected by the HMO-fingerprint in the respective breast milk. Independent of the initial presence of acidic or neutral fecal HMOs, a gradual change to blood-group specific oligosaccharides was observed. Their presence pointed to a gastrointestinal degradation of the feeding-related HMOs, followed by conjugation with blood group specific antigenic determinants present in the gastrointestinal mucus layer. Eleven of these 'hybrid'-oligosaccharides were annotated in this study. When solid food was introduced, no HMOs and their degradation- and metabolization products were recovered in the fecal samples.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of infant formula with polydextrose (PDX) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) on fecal microbiota and secretory IgA (sIgA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present double-blind, randomized study, term infants received control (Enfamil Lipil) or the same formula with PDX/GOS (4 g/L, 1:1 ratio; PDX/GOS) for 60 days; a reference breast-fed group was included. Formula intake, tolerance, and stool characteristics were collected via electronic diary and analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Anthropometric measurements and stool samples were obtained at baseline and after 30 and 60 days of feeding. Fecal sIgA was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fecal bacteria by fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR); both were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty infants completed the study. Infants consuming PDX/GOS had softer stools than control at all times (P < 0.001). Using qPCR, counts in PDX/GOS were closer to the breast-fed group, tended to be higher than control for total bifidobacteria (P = 0.069) and Bifidobacterium longum (P = 0.057) at 30 days, and were significantly higher for total bifidobacteria and B longum at 60 days and B infantis at 30 days (P = 0.002). No significant differences were detected between PDX/GOS and control in changes from baseline to 30 or 60 days for sIgA or total bifidobacteria by fluorescent in situ hybridization or qPCR; however, significantly higher changes from baseline were detected between PDX/GOS and control for B infantis at 30 days and B longum at 60 days (P </= 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Infant formula with PDX/GOS produces soft stools and a bifidogenic effect closer to breast milk than formula without PDX/GOS.",

VTEC was found in 10% of all of the stool samples analysed and seasonal occurrence of HUS (p < 0.01) was confirmed. VTEC infection was more prevalent in warm months, although the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, a significant difference in the detection of O157:H7 serotype and in the vt profile between cold and warm months (autumn and winter; spring and summer, respectively) was established. The O157:H7 serotype was isolated more frequently during warm months. Moreover, a predominance of vt (2) was noted, which was partially replaced by the combination of vt (1) with vt (2) in the cold season. The results of this study indicate the seasonal variation of the disease and the presence of serotype O157:H7 and the vt types. They also reinforce the need to develop prevention programmes considering the seasonal pattern of the disease, which would generate an impact on public health.

METHODS: In a case-control study from January 2003 to December 2008 in three university perinatal centers (two French and one Canadian hospitals), we analyzed 226 women with term pregnancies complicated by severe neonatal acidosis (umbilical artery pH less than 7.00). Cases were individually matched with controls with a normal acid-base status (pH 7.15 or greater) paired by parity. Groups were compared for differences in maternal, obstetric, and fetal characteristics. Univariable and logistic conditional regression were used to identify possible risk factors. RESULTS: Among 46,722 births after 22 weeks, 6,572 preterm births and 829 stillbirths or terminations of pregnancy were excluded. From the 39,321 live term births, 5.30% of pH values were unavailable. Severe acidosis complicated 0.63% of 37,235 term structurally normal pregnancies.

Fecal specimens from 480 children <5 years of age who were admitted to a large children's hospital in the city of Valencia, Venezuela, with acute diarrhea during January to December 2003 were collected and screened by ELISA and RT-PCR for rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus. Viral isolates were partially characterized by phylogenetic analysis. Norovirus viral load was determined by qRT-PCR. Viruses were identified in 205 (43%) of the 480 stool samples collected. Rotavirus was the virus detected most frequently (21%), followed by norovirus (13%), adenovirus (5%), sapovirus (3%), and astrovirus (2%). Viral infection rates were highest in the 6- to 11-month-old group (49%) and lowest in children >24 months old. Norovirus GII was more prevalent (90%) than GI (10%). Enteric adenovirus (serotypes 40/41) was present in 43% of the adenovirus-positive samples. Rotavirus infection caused more severe clinical symptoms than the other viruses detected, with more vomiting (84%) and dehydration (11%) that led to hospital admission of 20% of the children with acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus and norovirus showed marked and opposite seasonal patterns. No association was observed between disease severity and viral load in children infected with norovirus. These results not only confirm the impact of rotavirus infection in Venezuela but also indicate that other enteric viruses, especially noroviruses, contribute significantly to sporadic acute gastroenteritis and to the burden of disease.",

Human bocavirus 2 (HBoV2) was recently identified in stool samples and is involved in the pathogenesis of AGE, but the current data were too limited to clarify this issue. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a case-control study on 632 children with diarrhea and 162 healthy controls in Lanzhou, China, to assess the role of HBoV2 in gastroenteritis. STUDY DESIGN: Viruses known or suspected to be agents of AGE, including RV, HucV, AdV, AstV, and HBoVs, were detected. Viral loads of HBoV2 were quantified by Real-time PCR. RESULTS: HBoV2 was detected in 129 (20.4%) and 20 (12.3%) of the gastroenteritis and control samples, respectively. The association between HBoV2 and gastroenteritis was weaker (OR = 1.269, CI= 0.704-2.288) than that between gastroenteritis and RV, HucV, AdV, or AstV, as determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The data also suggested that infection with HBoV2 did not exacerbate the clinical symptoms of gastroenteritis. Mean HBoV2 viral load in the case and control groups was fewer than 55 copies/ml extract. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV2 exhibit different epidemiological features from HBoV1 and HBoV3. The data presented herein do not support a causative role for HBoV2 in AGE, despite its high prevalence in stool samples.",

			"abstract": "Numerous Lactobacillus species are members of the normal healthy human intestinal microbiota, and members of the Lactobacillus family predominate among the current marketed probiotic strains. Most of the current commercial probiotic strains have not been selected for specific applications but rather have been chosen based on their technological properties. Often the ability of such strains to temporarily colonize the gastrointestinal tract may be lacking, and the interactions with intestinal microbiota are few. Furthermore, the competitive exclusion properties of potential probiotic bacteria are strain specific and vary greatly. Thus, it is highly desirable that new candidate probiotic isolates originate from the healthy target population. In this study, seven newly isolated strains of Lactobacillus gasseri originating from feces of a healthy newborn child were evaluated for their ability to adhere to intestinal mucus, to autoaggregate and coaggregate with the model pathogens Cronobacter sakazakii (ATCC 29544) and Clostridium difficile (1296). All the bacterial strains, single or in combination, in viable and nonviable forms, were able to autoaggregate. The coaggregation with C. sakazakii or C. difficile was higher (P < 0.05) in nonviable than in the viable forms. Single L. gasseri strains showed similar adhesion abilities to intestinal colon mucus. The seven L. gasseri strains when combined were also able to significantly compete with, displace, and inhibit the adhesion of C. sakazakii and C. difficile in the mucus model. This study demonstrates that the studied L. gasseri strains fulfill the basic adhesion and aggregation properties for probiotics and could be considered for potential future use in children.",

However, results are inconsistent, and the hypothesized intermediate role of the microbiota in the association between birth mode and atopic manifestations has not been studied yet. OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the relationship between microbiota composition, mode and place of delivery, and atopic manifestations. METHODS: The Child, Parent and Health: Lifestyle and Genetic Constitution Birth Cohort Study included data on birth characteristics, lifestyle factors, and atopic manifestations collected through repeated questionnaires from birth until age 7 years. Fecal samples were collected at age 1 month (n = 1176) to determine microbiota composition, and blood samples were collected at ages 1 (n = 921), 2 (n = 822), and 6 to 7 (n = 384) years to determine specific IgE levels. RESULTS: Colonization by Clostridium difficile at age 1 month was associated with wheeze and eczema throughout the first 6 to 7 years of life and with asthma at age 6 to 7 years. Vaginal home delivery compared with vaginal hospital delivery was associated with a decreased risk of eczema, sensitization to food allergens, and asthma. After stratification for parental history of atopy, the decreased risk of sensitization to food allergens (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35-0.77) and asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.77) among vaginally home-born infants was only found for children with atopic parents. Mediation analysis showed that the effects of mode and place of delivery on atopic outcomes were mediated by C difficile colonization.

We describe the natural history of rotavirus shedding in premature infants in the 2-week period following first immunization with RotaTeq((R)), the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5), and the risk for symptomatic transmission to household contacts (HHC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective pilot study of 15 premature infants of gestational ages 26-34 weeks immunized with RV5 between 6 and 14 weeks chronological age on discharge from the NICU was conducted. Stool samples collected in the following 2 weeks and analyzed for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), cell culture, and RT-PCR. Solicited adverse events were collected on study subjects and any symptoms of fever, vomiting and diarrhea in HHC. RESULTS: Rotavirus antigen shedding after immunization was detected, with positive rotavirus EIA results in 53.3% of premature infants and in 22.1% of 86 stool samples collected. Shedding rates by RT-PCR were higher with 86.7% of infants and 76.7% of samples being positive. Only 42% of EIA positive samples were positive by cell culture (8/86 total samples, 9.3%). None of 53 HHC reported symptoms of rotavirus infection during the 4 weeks following immunization of the infants. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that premature infants have positive stools by EIA, viral culture, and RT-PCR at varying time points during 2 weeks following first-dose immunization with RV5. RT-PCR shedding rates need to be clinically evaluated in the context of virus quantification by cell culture, which was low. No symptomatic transmission to HHC was detected in this study, supporting low transmissibility of vaccine virus shed by these infants born prematurely.",

In recent years, community-acquired infections due to ESBL-PE have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community of Antananarivo. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients were recruited in three health centers in different socio economic settings. Fresh stool collected were immediately plated on Drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. Gram-negative bacilli species were identified and ESBL production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. Characterization of ESBLs were perfomed by PCR and direct sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was analysed by Rep-PCR and ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio  =  1.03, median age 28 years). 53 ESBL-PE were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). The isolates included Escherichia coli (31), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Enterobacter cloacae (3), Citrobacter freundii (3), Kluyvera spp. (1) and Pantoae sp. (1). In multivariate analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of carriage of ESBL in the community of Antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. This alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.",

			"abstract": "To investigate possible impact of limited vaccine uptake by the private sector since 2007, a prospective observational study included all children <5 years hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in a Tertiary Care Hospital between 09/2006 and 08/2010. Rotavirus (RV) antigen was detected in stools by a rapid immunochromatographic test and genotype analysis was performed on positive samples by RT-PCR. Compared to 2006-2008, the likelihood of rotavirus infection was significantly reduced among children hospitalized for AGE in 2008-2010 (OR 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49-0.84, p<0.001). This was mainly due to the reduction of RVGE cases in infants 0-11 months (p=0.035). Moreover, RVGE cases as well as the rate of RVGE/10,000 hospitalized children significantly decreased (p=0.009 and p=0.010 respectively). No children with rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) had received any vaccine dose. G4P [8] was the most common genotype (64/90). In conclusion, this study indicates that even low RV vaccination coverage may have significant effect.",

The objective of the present study was to compare RV strains isolated in Northern (Ferrara) and Southern (Galatina-LE) Italy. During 2007-2008, 115 RV-positive stool samples were collected from children with diarrhea admitted to the hospitals of Ferrara and Galatina. The specimens were genotyped for VP7 (G-type) and VP4 (P-type) gene by reverse transcription (RT) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A subset of 21 RV strains was randomly selected and characterized by sequence analysis of the VP7 genes. In total, seven G/P combinations (G1P[8], G2P[4], G4P[8], G9P[8], G2P[8], G1P[9], and G2P[10]) were identified. Phylogenetic comparison of the VP7 encoding gene of selected strains showed that there was similarity among RV strains circulating in Northern and Southern Italy. The observation of nucleotide sequence diversity contributes to a better understanding of RV spreading and helps to characterize the various antigenic shifts that could have an impact on vaccine effectiveness.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: More than 500,000 deaths are attributed to rotavirus gastroenteritis annually worldwide, with the highest mortality in India. Two successive, naturally occurring rotavirus infections have been shown to confer complete protection against moderate or severe gastroenteritis during subsequent infections in a birth cohort in Mexico. We studied the protective effect of rotavirus infection on subsequent infection and disease in a birth cohort in India (where the efficacy of oral vaccines in general has been lower than expected). METHODS: We recruited children at birth in urban slums in Vellore; they were followed for 3 years after birth, with home visits twice weekly. Stool samples were collected every 2 weeks, as well as on alternate days during diarrheal episodes, and were tested by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase-chain-reaction assay. Serum samples were obtained every 6 months and evaluated for seroconversion, defined as an increase in the IgG antibody level by a factor of 4 or in the IgA antibody level by a factor of 3. RESULTS: Of 452 recruited children, 373 completed 3 years of follow-up. Rotavirus infection generally occurred early in life, with 56% of children infected by 6 months of age. Levels of reinfection were high, with only approximately 30% of all infections identified being primary. Protection against moderate or severe disease increased with the order of infection but was only 79% after three infections. With G1P[8], the most common viral strain, there was no evidence of homotypic protection. CONCLUSIONS: Early infection and frequent reinfection in a locale with high viral diversity resulted in lower protection than has been reported elsewhere, providing a possible explanation why rotavirus vaccines have had lower-than-expected efficacy in Asia and Africa.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Changes in the human microbiome have been suggested as a risk factor for a number of lifestyle-related disorders, such as atopic diseases, possibly through a modifying influence on immune maturation in infancy. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the association between neonatal fecal flora and the development of atopic disorders until age 6 years, hypothesizing that the diversity of the intestinal microbiota influences disease development. METHODS: We studied the intestinal microbiota in infants in the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood, a clinical study of a birth cohort of 411 high-risk children followed for 6 years by clinical assessments at 6-month intervals, as well as at acute symptom exacerbations. Bacterial flora was analyzed at 1 and 12 months of age by using molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, as well as conventional culturing. The main outcome measures were the development of allergic sensitization (skin test and specific serum IgE), allergic rhinitis, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, asthma, and atopic dermatitis during the first 6 years of life. RESULTS: We found that bacterial diversity in the early intestinal flora 1 and 12 months after birth was inversely associated with the risk of allergic sensitization (serum specific IgE P = .003; skin prick test P = .017), peripheral blood eosinophils (P = .034), and allergic rhinitis (P = .007). There was no association with the development of asthma or atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced bacterial diversity of the infant's intestinal flora was associated with increased risk of allergic sensitization, allergic rhinitis, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, but not asthma or atopic dermatitis, in the first 6 years of life. These results support the general hypothesis that an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome is influencing the development of lifestyle-related disorders, such as allergic disease.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the previously unexplored diversity of neonatal intestinal microbiota and monitor early intestinal colonization patterns in Korean preterm infants using high-throughput pyrosequencing technology combined with 16S rDNA-based molecular methods. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 46,369 partial 16S rDNA sequences obtained from 30 fecal samples serially taken from 10 very-low-birth weight preterm infants were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant proportion of the molecular species (21.9%) was found to be unclassified. The pathogenic or potentially pathogenic molecular species belonging to the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli were predominant during the entire observation period. Anaerobic or nonpathogenic molecular species belonging to the class Clostridia (except Clostridium difficile) and phyla Bacteroidetes were ubiquitous even within 72 hours after birth. The proportion of these species increased significantly at 1 month of age. The most ubiquitous and abundant major molecular genera common to all of the postnatal ages were Escherichia, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Veillonella, Serratia, Staphylococcus, Roseburia, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and Streptococcus. CONCLUSIONS: The diversity and dynamic nature of intestinal bacterial colonization in very-low-birth weight preterm infants were revealed using pyrosequencing technology.

Effective control of gastroenteritis should be targeted at the diseases with the highest burden and costs. For that, an accurate understanding of the relative importance of the different bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens is needed. The objective of the present study was to determine the incidence and etiology of gastroenteritis requiring hospital admission in the Netherlands. Six hospitals enrolled patients admitted with gastroenteritis for approximately one year over the period May 2008 to November 2009. Participants provided questionnaires and a fecal sample, and the hospital filled out a clinical questionnaire. In total, 143 children hospitalized for gastroenteritis and 64 matched controls were included in the study. Overall incidence of gastroenteritis requiring hospitalization was estimated at 2.92 per 1,000 children aged 0-17 years per year, with the highest incidence in children under the age of 5 years. The full diagnostic panel of pathogens could be studied in fecal samples of 96 cases. One or more pathogens were found in 98% of these cases. Co-infections were observed relatively often (40%). Viruses were detected in 82% of the samples, with rotavirus being most common (56%), bacteria in 32% and parasites in 10%. The present study emphasizes the importance of viral pathogens, especially rotavirus, in hospitalizations of children with gastroenteritis. Policies to reduce (costs of) hospitalizations due to gastroenteritis should therefore be first targeted at rotavirus.",

This deserves attention because of the high incidence of sepsis and the differences in hygienic environments in developing countries compared with the developed world. The study was carried out on neonates in a tertiary-care government hospital. Serial gut samples were analysed (gastric aspirates and stool samples) for GNB. Blood samples of cases showing clinical signs of sepsis were also analysed for septic screening and culture positivity. Antibiograms, serotyping and PFGE were carried out to evaluate the relatedness of the gut and blood isolates. A diverse array of GNB was isolated from the gut of the neonates, Klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, followed by Escherichia coli. The rate of isolation of GNB was consistently higher in stool samples compared with gastric aspirate samples. Colonization was influenced by a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and by the prolonged use of a feeding tube. GNB were the cause of sepsis in the majority of cases, with K. pneumoniae being the most frequently isolated GNB from the blood. Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Burkholderia cepacia were the other GNB recovered from the blood of the neonates. Neonates with GNB in the gut had a higher incidence of clinical sepsis than those without. In 50 % of cases, the genotypes of the organisms found in the blood were indistinguishable from their gut counterpart. These results show that the neonatal gut is colonized with a diverse array of GNB, and an association between gut colonization and neonatal sepsis was observed.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. Intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. However, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. The benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. This study was performed to evaluate the interaction between Lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. RESULTS: Strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in McConkey Agar and identified using PCR with species-specific primers, and the BBL Enterotube II system for Enterobacteriaceae. Gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. The average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) CFU/g of faeces (p = 0.015). The following strains were identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis. Then, 27 Lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that two out of 27 strains of Lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. Our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which Lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this survey was to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) colonization in HIV-infected, highly active antiretroviral therapy-naive Ugandan children aged 0-12 years. METHODS: In a hospital-based survey, 236 HIV-infected children were tested for H. pylori colonization using a faecal antigen test. A standardized interview with socio-demographic information and medical history was used to assess risk factors. A cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell percentage was prevalent in most children. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of H. pylori in the HIV-infected children was 22.5%. Age-specific prevalence was as follows: up to one year, 14.7%; 1-3 years, 30.9%; and 3-12 years, 20.7%. HIV-infected children who were more seriously affected by their disease (low CD4 cell percentage or WHO clinical stage II-IV) were less likely to be colonized with H. pylori. There was a trend for a lower prevalence of H. pylori in children who had taken antibiotics for the preceding two weeks (21.6%) than in those who had not taken antibiotics (35.7%). There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence by gender, housing, congested living, education of the female caretaker, drinking water or toilet facilities. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected, HAART-naive Ugandan children had a lower prevalence of H. pylori colonization compared with apparently healthy Ugandan children (44.3%). Children with a low CD4 cell percentage and an advanced clinical stage of HIV had an even lower risk of H. pylori colonization. Treatment with antibiotics due to co-morbidity with infectious diseases is a possible explanation for the relatively low prevalence.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Autosomal recessive, congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) is a form of persistent secretory diarrhea, presenting with polyhydramnios and intractable diarrhea from birth. CLD is caused by mutations in the SLC26A3 gene, encoding a Na+-independent Cl/HCO3- exchanger. The diagnosis is generally made on the basis of high fecal chloride concentration in patients with serum electrolyte homoeostasis corrected by salt substitution. We aimed to evaluate the role of diagnostic genetic testing in CLD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were collected from 8 unrelated children diagnosed as having or suspected to have CLD. The evaluation included physical examination, routine clinical chemistry, and SLC26A3 mutation analysis by direct sequencing of DNA extracted from buccal swabs or peripheral leukocytes. RESULTS: CLD was initially diagnosed on high fecal chloride concentrations in 7 patients, and by mutation analysis in 1 patient. In 3 of these patients the correct diagnosis was made more than 6 months after birth. We identified SLC26A3 mutations on both alleles in all 8 patients with CLD, including 3 novel missense and 4 novel truncating mutations. We present a compilation of reported SLC26A3 mutations and polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis and therapy of CLD were considerably delayed in 3 of 8 patients from this series, highlighting the potential of misdiagnosing CLD. We add 7 novel mutations, including 3 missense changes of highly conserved residues to a total of 41 mutations in this gene. Molecular analysis is efficient and should be considered as a means of early diagnosis of CLD, especially if the clinical diagnosis remains uncertain.",

Starting with the first stool and continuing until discharge, weekly stool specimens were collected prospectively from infants with gestational ages </=32 completed weeks or birth weights</=1250 g. High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to compare the diversity of microbiota and the prevalence of specific bacterial signatures in nine NEC infants and in nine matched controls. After removal of short and low quality reads we retained a total of 110,021 sequences. Microbiota composition differed in the matched samples collected 1 week but not <72 hours prior to NEC diagnosis. We detected a bloom (34% increase) of Proteobacteria and a decrease (32%) in Firmicutes in NEC cases between the 1 week and <72 hour samples. No significant change was identified in the controls. At both time points, molecular signatures were identified that were increased in NEC cases. One of the bacterial signatures detected more frequently in NEC cases (p<0.01) matched closest to gamma-Proteobacteria. Although this sequence grouped to the well-studied Enterobacteriaceae family, it did not match any sequence in Genbank by more than 97%.

A total of 25 NoV-positive samples were selected for nucleotide sequence analysis. The severity of AdV-associated infection was lower than for NoV, HRV and HBoV. These latter viruses caused similar symptoms that were indistinguishable using clinical information. NoV, HRV and HBoV were often present as mixed infections (13.1%). Sequencing of NoV-positive samples allowed identification of GII.2, GII.3 and GII.4 2006 variants.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of milk-feeding practices and the HLA-DQ genotype on intestinal colonization of Bacteroides species in infants at risk of CD development. This study included 75 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative suffering from CD. Infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breast-feeding or formula feeding) and HLA-DQ genotype (high or low genetic risk). Stools were analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The Bacteroides species diversity index was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. Breast-fed infants showed a higher prevalence of Bacteroides uniformis at 1 and 4 months of age, while formula-fed infants had a higher prevalence of B. intestinalis at all sampling times, of B. caccae at 7 days and 4 months, and of B. plebeius at 4 months. Infants with high genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of B. vulgatus, while those with low genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of B. ovatus, B. plebeius, and B. uniformis. Among breast-fed infants, the prevalence of B. uniformis was higher in those with low genetic risk than in those with high genetic risk. Among formula-fed infants, the prevalence of B. ovatus and B. plebeius was increased in those with low genetic risk, while the prevalence of B. vulgatus was higher in those with high genetic risk. The results indicate that both the type of milk feeding and the HLA-DQ genotype influence the colonization process of Bacteroides species, and possibly the disease risk.",

A subgroup of neonates born large for GA (LGA) was compared with the neonates appropriate for GA (AGA). Fecal samples were collected, within 48 h after birth, from 79 neonates. Quantitative PCR was used for enumeration of Lactobacillus, a subgroup of Lactobacillus common in the vagina, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Cloning and sequencing were applied for subgroups of neonates born LGA or AGA. Lactobacillus was detected in all neonates, whereas other bacterial groups were detected only in 14 to 30% of the subjects. The prevalence of Gram-negative Proteobacteria was higher in neonates born LGA, whereas Gram-positive Firmicutes was more prevalent in neonates born AGA (p < 0.001). This study contributed to increased knowledge of the pioneer microbiota and indicates that neonates born LGA had significantly different microbiota compared with those born AGA. As the early microbiota can be important for maturation of the immune system, the outcome from this study may be relevant in the care of pregnant woman and newborns.",

In this study, Lactobacillus strains were isolated from infant faeces and were examined in vitro for potential probiotic properties. Faecal specimens from 63 healthy, full-term infants were collected at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery. Seventy-four Lactobacillus strains were isolated and one or more different phenotypes from each infant (n = 44) were selected for further testing. The bacterial isolates were identified mainly as L. gasseri, L. crispatus, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. salivarius, L. fermentum after amplification and sequencing of 16s rRNA gene. The strains were examined for acid and bile tolerance, adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity against selected enteric pathogens. The great majority of the isolated lactobacilli were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. Resistance to vancomycin or bacitracin was detected to 34% of the strains. Twenty strains out of forty-four exhibited significant tolerance to bile salts. Those strains were subsequently tested for resistance to low pH conditions (pH 2 and 3). Interestingly, 85% (17 strains) of the tested lactobacilli remained unaffected at pH 3 after 3 h of incubation, 6 strains were found resistant at pH 2 after 1.5 h and only 2 strains found resistant after 3 h of incubation. Two of the strains were able to adhere to Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, two isolates fulfilled the in vitro probiotic criteria and are good candidates for further in vivo evaluation.",

In the present study, the effect of prebiotics administered from the first day of life on fecal counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were studied during and after the administration of the prebiotics. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, explorative study, 20 newborns of hepatitis C virus-infected mothers who decided not to breast feed due to their concerns regarding their plasma viral load were randomly assigned to either a formula with 8 g/L of a specific prebiotic mixture (short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides, ratio 9:1) or a formula containing the same amount of maltodextrin (placebo). Clinical examination including anthropometric measurements, microbiological analysis of fecal samples, and blood leukocyte population analysis were performed at birth and 3, 6, and 12 mo age. At the age of 12 mo, hepatitis B vaccine-specific IgG serum titers (Hepatitis B virus surface antibodies) were also measured. Prebiotic supplementation resulted in more fecal bifidobacteria (P < 0.0001) and lactobacilli (P = 0.0044) compared with the placebo group. These differences between the groups were maintained during the second half of the first year without any prebiotic supplementation. There was no influence of the different diets on anthropometric data or the measured immunological variables. The data from this small explorative study indicate that early colonization of the intestine might have long-lasting effects on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.",

METHODS: Subjects were randomized to Orafti Synergy1 (50 oligofructose:50 FOS) 0.4 g/dL or 0.8 g/dL, GOS:FOS (90:10) 0.8 g/dL, or a standard formula according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines. A breast-fed group was included for comparison. Outcome parameters were weight, length, intake, stool characteristics, crying, regurgitation, vomiting, adverse events, and fecal bacterial population counts. Statistical analyses used nonparametric tests. RESULTS: During the first month of life, weight, length, intake, and crying increased significantly in all of the groups. Regurgitation and vomiting scores were low and similar. Stool frequency decreased significantly and similarly in all of the formula groups but was lower than in the breast-fed group. All of the prebiotic groups maintained soft stools, only slightly harder than those of breast-fed infants. The standard group had significantly harder stools at weeks 2 and 4 compared with 1 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.0279). The total number of fecal bacteria increased in all of the prebiotic groups (9.82, 9.73, and 9.91 to 10.34, 10.38, and 10.37, respectively, log10 cells/g feces, P = 0.2298) and more closely resembled the breast-fed pattern. Numbers of lactic acid bacteria, bacteroides, and clostridia were comparable. In the SYN1 0.8 g/dL and GOS:FOS groups, Bifidobacterium counts were significantly higher at D14 and 28 compared with D3 and were comparable with the breast-fed group. Tolerance and growth were normal. CONCLUSIONS: Stool consistency and bacterial composition of infants taking SYN1 0.8 g/dL or GOS:FOS-supplemented formula were closer to the breast-fed pattern.

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Breast-feeding induces a gut microbiota rich in bifidobacteria, whereas formula-fed babies have a more diverse colonization. This ecosystem contributes to the development of the immune response and the lower incidence of diarrhea and allergy in breast-fed infants. This randomized double-blind controlled trial aimed to evaluate the bifidogenic effect of a mainly whey protein study formula low in phosphate and protein, allowing a composition closer to that of human milk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety healthy infants exclusively received study formula with or without Bifidobacterium longum (BL999), or a control formula for up to 4 months. Breast-fed infants served as a reference population. Stool samples collected at 2 months of age were analyzed for bacterial counts (log colony-forming unit [CFU]/g). RESULTS: Bifidobacteria counts were significantly higher in infants receiving the study formula alone (10.0[0.8], P < 0.0001, median [interquartile range]) or with BL999 (9.8[1.4], P < 0.01) than control (9.2[3.5]), and were similar to breast-fed infants (10.1[0.4], P > 0.05). The difference between the 2 study groups was 0.16 log CFU/g (90% confidence interval [CI] [0-0.4]), within the predefined equivalence margin. Microbiota profile, as a percentage of total bacteria counts, showed about 50% Bifidobacteria, 8% Enterobacteria, and <10% Clostridia in study formulae and breast-fed infants versus 22%, 13%, and 19% in controls, respectively. There were no significant differences in growth measurements, digestive tolerance, and adverse events between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that infant formula closer resembling human milk was more bifidogenic than the control formula and led to a microbiota profile similar to that for breast-fed infants.",

STUDY DESIGN: REE was measured in 26 patients with SCID in a single transplant center. Predicted REE was determined with World Health Organization standards. Measured REE >110% of predicted REE was classified as hypermetabolism. Other data collected included FTT status, infections, genotype, phenotype, and the feeding methods used. RESULTS: Fifteen of 26 patients (57.7%) had FTT, and 18 of 26 patients (69.2%) were hypermetabolic. Hypermetabolism occured in 14 of 15 patients (93%) with FTT, and only 4 of 11 patients (36%) without FTT had hypermetabolism (P = .003). There was a significant difference between the measured REE (71.75 +/- 16.6 kcal/kg) and the predicted REE (52.85 +/- 2.8 kcal/kg; P < .0001). Eleven of 17 patients (65%) required nasogastric feeding, parenteral nutrition, or both to meet their energy needs. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermetabolism is common in patients with SCID and may contribute to the development of FTT. The hypermetabolism in these patients may necessitate intensive nutrition support.",

Here we provide an update of the current situation of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and urinary schistosomiasis on Unguja Island, and highlight socioeconomic development, improvement in sanitation and health education as additional drivers against helminthiases. Our data were obtained from cross-sectional surveys carried out between 2006 and 2009 with stool and urine samples from 2858 and 879 individuals, respectively, examined for helminth eggs and larvae. Additionally, several hundred people were interviewed on sanitation and hygienic behaviour. Data on Unguja's economic growth and improvements in access to clean water and household latrines in the recent past were derived from the extant literature. Pooled prevalences of Trichuris trichiura, Schistosoma haematobium, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were 35%, 29%, 12%, 10% and 6%, respectively. However, there were considerable differences in prevalences between different age-groups and at village and district level. Moreover, some hotspots for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and S. haematobium were identified with prevalences above 60% among school-aged children. Availability of a latrine and washing hands before eating did not significantly lower the risk of helminth infections in our study population. Nevertheless, a considerable increase in access to household latrines (from 49% to 72%) and piped water (from 45% to 71%) between 1991 and 2005 is likely to have contributed to reducing the force of transmission of helminthiases in Zanzibar. The next logical step in Unguja is to change the tactics from morbidity control to interruption of helminth transmission and ultimately local elimination. Hence, 'preventive chemotherapy' needs to be further consolidated, placing particular emphasis on health education and improved access to clean water and sanitation.",

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes of infants with CRMS identified through an IRT/DNA algorithm. We reviewed the records of all infants with CRMS diagnosed at our CF Center from 2002 to 2010. We identified 12 infants, and compared them to 27 infants diagnosed with CF by NBS. Compared to CF patients, CRMS patients were more likely to be pancreatic sufficient as assessed by fecal elastase measurement (100% vs. 8%, P < 0.01). Their weight for age percentile was normal from birth. A positive oropharyngeal (OP) culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) was found in 25% of CRMS patients. One patient with the F508del/R117H/7T genotype was reassigned the diagnosis of CF after he had a positive OP culture for Pa, and his follow up sweat Cl at 1 year of life was 73 mmol/L. CF patients were more likely to receive oral antibiotics and be hospitalized for pulmonary symptoms. Our results indicate that CRMS patients can develop signs of CF disease, but have a milder clinical course than CF infants. Close initial monitoring of these patients is warranted. Pediatr.

			"abstract": "The development of the gut is controlled and modulated by different interacting mechanisms such as, genetic endowment, intrinsic biological regulatory functions, environment influences and last but no least, the diet influence. Considered together with other endogenous and exogenous factors the type of feeding may interfere greatly in the regulation of the intestinal microbiota. During the last years molecular methods offer a complementarity to the classic culture-based knowledge. FISH has been applied for molecular evaluation of the microbiota in newborns delivered by vaginal delivery. Eleven probes/probe combinations for specific groups of faecal bacteria were used to determine the bacterial composition in faecal samples of newborns infants under different types of feeding. Breast-fed infants harbor a fecal microbiota by more than two times increased in numbers of Bifidobacterium cells when compared to formula-fed infants. After formula-feeding, Atopobium was found in significant counts and the numbers of Bifidobacterium dropped followed by increasing numbers in Bacteroides population. Moreover, under formula feeding the infants microbiota was more diverse.",

			"abstract": "Foodborne infections are an important public health problem in China. In 2008, we conducted surveillance for laboratory-confirmed nontyphoidal Salmonella to monitor trends for this infection in China and to build capacity for rapid detection and response to foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella isolates from patients with diarrhea were sent from hospitals to local public health laboratories for confirmation, serotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 126 hospitals in 44 cities and counties from 8 provinces provided isolates and epidemiologic data for analysis. Of 23,140 stool specimens submitted to clinical laboratories, 662 (3%) grew Salmonella enterica. Salmonella were most commonly detected between April and October. The median age of infected patients was 27 years; 34% of infections occurred in patients <5 years old. Of the 662 isolates, we found 73 serotypes, of which serotype Enteritidis (31%) and serotype Typhimurium (26%) were the most common. The prevalence of resistance was high for clinically important antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin (41%) and ciprofloxacin (6%). More than 60% of isolates, including 35% of all Typhimurium, were resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. In this first multiprovince surveillance report of laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections in China, we found that Enteritidis and Typhimurium are the most common serotypes and that efforts to reduce antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella in China are needed. Although no outbreaks were detected using this system, efforts to improve this system's capacity to do so are underway.",

			"article_name": "Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of neonatal intestinal microbiota in relation to the development of asthma.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The extended 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that the initial composition of the infant gut microbiota is a key determinant in the development of atopic disease. Several studies have demonstrated that the microbiota of allergic and non-allergic infants are different even before the development of symptoms, with a critical time window during the first 6 months of life. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between early intestinal colonisation and the development of asthma in the first 3 years of life using DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). METHODS: In a prospective birth cohort, 110 children were classified according to the API (Asthma Predictive Index). A positive index included wheezing during the first three years of life combined with eczema in the child in the first years of life or with a parental history of asthma. A fecal sample was taken at the age of 3 weeks and analysed with DGGE using universal and genus specific primers. RESULTS: The Asthma Predictive Index was positive in 24/110 (22%) of the children. Using universal V3 primers a band corresponding to a Clostridum coccoides XIVa species was significantly associated with a positive API. A Bacteroides fragilis subgroup band was also significantly associated with a positive API. A final DGGE model, including both bands, allowed correct classification of 73% (80/110) of the cases. CONCLUSION: Fecal colonisation at age 3 weeks with either a Bacteroides fragilis subgroup or a Clostridium coccoides subcluster XIVa species is an early indicator of possible asthma later in life. These findings need to be confirmed in a new longitudinal follow-up study.",

Serotypes 7 (30%), 2 (28%), and 3 (23%) accounted for most of S. dysenteriae isolates; 50% of S. boydii isolates were serotype 2. S. dysenteriae and S. boydii isolates were often resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline (42%, 17%, respectively), although resistance varied among serotypes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis separated the isolates into distinct clusters correlating with species and serotype. Genetic differences in trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam-encoding resistance genes were also evident. S. dysenteriae and S. boydii are genetically diverse pathogens in Egypt; the high level of multidrug resistance associated with both pathogens and resistance to the most available inexpensive antibiotics underlines the importance of continuing surveillance.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether daily glycerin suppositories (a) reduce the time to full enteral feeding in infants born at <32 weeks' gestation, and (b) influence feed tolerance, incidence of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis, duration of oxygen requirement, growth or age at discharge. METHODS: Design - prospective open randomized controlled trial; study population - preterm infants stratified into 2 subgroups, 24-27(+6) weeks (24-27 weeks + 6 days) and 28-31(+6) weeks; intervention - daily glycerin suppository for 10 days from 24 h of age, 250 mg (24-27(+6) weeks subgroup) or 500 mg (two 250-mg suppositories; 28-31(+6) weeks subgroup); controls - no intervention. The same feeding protocol and departmental guidelines for other aspects of neonatal intensive care were used in all subjects. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: 54 babies were recruited (31 males), 29 randomized to receive suppositories; 48 achieved full enteral feeds. The median (range) time to full feeds was 1.6 days shorter in intervention group babies than controls, but not statistically significant: 7.4 (4.6-30.9) days versus 9.0 (4.4-13.3) days (p = 0.780; 95% confidence interval: -1.917, 2.166). No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes. Intervention group babies passed their first stool earlier than controls (median: day 2 vs. day 4; p = 0.016).

METHODS: In this explorative RCT, preterm infants with gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500 g received enteral supplementation with scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS or placebo (maltodextrin) between days 3 and 30 of life. Stool samples were collected at day 30 after birth. RESULTS: In total, 113 infants were included. Baseline and nutritional characteristics were not different between both groups. Stool viscosity at day 30 was lower in the prebiotics group (16.8N) (3.9-67.8) compared with the placebo group (26.3N) (1.3-148.0) (p = 0.03; 95% CI -0.80 to 0.03). There was a trend towards higher stool frequency in the prebiotics group (3.1 +/- 0.8) compared with the placebo group (2.8 +/- 0.7) (p = 0.15; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.52).

CONCLUSIONS: Enteral supplementation of a prebiotic mixture consisting of neutral (scGOS/lcFOS) and acidic oligosaccharides (pAOS) decreases stool viscosity and stool pH with a trend towards increased stool frequency in preterm infants. The inclusion of pAOS in a formula containing a mixture of scGOS/lcFOS does not add specific advantages to the formula in terms of stool viscosity, frequency, pH as well as feeding tolerance.",

METHODOLOGY: A total of 877 stool samples were received for culture at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), Kathmandu, Nepal, during January 2002 to December 2004, from diarrhoea patients attending Shukraraj Tropical Infectious Hospital and referral outpatients. All samples collected were processed for isolation and antibiotic susceptibility testing of Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. RESULTS: Of the 877 stool samples, 148 (16.8%) were culture positive for one of the three bacterial enteropathogens investigated. Among them, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. accounted for 98/877 (11.1%), 41/877 (4.6%), 9/877 (1.02%) of the isolates respectively. A year-to-year variation was seen in the type of predominant organism, with Shigella spp. being the most prevalent in 2002 and 2003 and Vibrio spp. in 2004. In all three years, Vibrio cholerae were encountered only during the months of April to June while Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were isolated throughout the whole year. All Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.  All Shigella isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin resistance was observed among isolates of Shigella dysenteriae type-1 isolated after 2003. CONCLUSION: Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella and Shigella infections are prevalent in Kathmandu, Nepal. A gradual increase in resistance to commonly used antimicrobials was seen among bacterial enteropathogens. Antimicrobial resistance surveillance is necessary to guide empirical treatment.",

Modulation of colonisation through dietary supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics could decrease such a risk. The present study evaluated clinical tolerance, the effects on gut microbiota, and inflammatory and immunological mucosal responses to an infant formula adapted for pre-term infants that included in its manufacturing process a fermentation step with two probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065, inactivated by heat at the end of the process. A total of fifty-eight infants (gestational age: 30-35 weeks), fed either the fermented pre-term formula or a standard pre-term formula, were followed up during their hospital stay. Clinical tolerance, faecal microbiota using a culture and a culture-independent method (temporal temperature gel electrophoresis), faecal calprotectin and secretory IgA were analysed weekly. No difference was observed regarding anthropometric data and digestive tolerance, except for abdominal distension, the incidence of which was lower in infants fed the fermented formula for 2 weeks. Bacterial colonisation was not modified by the type of feeding, particularly for bifidobacteria. Faecal calprotectin was significantly lower in infants fed the fermented formula for 2 weeks, and secretory IgA increased with both mother's milk and the fermented formula. The fermented formula was well tolerated and did not significantly modulate the bacterial colonisation but had benefits on inflammatory and immune markers, which might be related to some features of gastrointestinal tolerance.",

			"abstract": "During replication, oral polio vaccine (OPV) can revert to neurovirulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis. In individual vaccinees, it can acquire specific revertant point mutations, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). With longer replication, OPV can mutate into vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which causes poliomyelitis outbreaks similar to those caused by wild poliovirus. After wild poliovirus eradication, safely phasing out vaccination will likely require global use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) until cessation of OPV circulation. Mexico, where children receive routine IPV but where OPV is given biannually during national immunization days (NIDs), provides a natural setting to study the duration of OPV circulation in a population primarily vaccinated with IPV. We developed a real-time PCR assay to detect and distinguish revertant and nonrevertant OPV serotype 1 (OPV-1), OPV-2, and OPV-3 from RNA extracted directly from stool and sewage. Stool samples from 124 children and 8 1-liter sewage samples from Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico, collected 6 to 13 weeks after a NID were analyzed. Revertant OPV-1 was found in stool at 7 and 9 weeks, and nonrevertant OPV-2 and OPV-3 were found in stool from two children 10 weeks after the NID. Revertant OPV-1 and nonrevertant OPV-2 and -3 were detected in sewage at 6 and 13 weeks after the NID. Our real-time PCR assay was able to detect small amounts of OPV in both stool and sewage and to distinguish nonrevertant and revertant serotypes and demonstrated that OPV continues to circulate at least 13 weeks after a NID in a Mexican population routinely immunized with IPV.",

Prospective testing of samples with retrospective analysis of medical charts was performed. RESULTS: Of the 499 clinical samples received between May, 2009 and May, 2010, 9.6% (46 patients) had HEV detected and 3.4% (15 patients) had HPeV detected. All patients infected by HPeV were <3 months old, hospitalized between June and October 2009, and all typed viruses were HPeV3. Clinical characteristics of HPeV and HEV infected infants were similar. However, patients infected with HPeV were more likely to have a normal leukocyte count in their CSF (p<0.001). One HPeV3-infected infant developed encephalitis and another developed hepatitis.

The predominant G genotype was G9 (39.5 %), followed by G1 (35.3 %) and G4 (15.5 %), while P[8] was the most prevalent P genotype (66.5 %), followed by P[4] (21.9 %) and P[6] (11.2 %). The gene combinations G1P[8] and G9P[8] were the most prevalent (21.4 % and 20.6 %, respectively), followed by G4P[8] (13 %) and G9P[6] (8.8 %). Immunization data showed that only 17/238 (7.1 %) children received >/=one dose of RV vaccine (the pentavalent vaccine RotaTeq or the monovalent vaccine Rotarix) and that 10/17 were infected with G4P[8] strains. Severity of RV gastroenteritis episodes was not related to the infecting G genotype. Our results suggest a high proportion of genotype G9 strains in combination with P[8], P[6] and P[4] specificity circulating in the metropolitan Detroit area. While the protective efficacy of the RV vaccines has been demonstrated against G9P[8] strains, the level of cross-protection offered by the vaccines against G9 strains with P[6] and P[4] genotypes in the Detroit paediatric population remains to be determined.",

			"abstract": "Acute diarrhea is a public health problem and an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. The etiology is varied, and the diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes are among the most important. Our objectives were to determine the occurrence of commensal and diarrheagenic E. coli strains in fecal samples from children under five years old and their drug susceptibility patterns. E. coli were isolated from 141 fresh fecal samples; 84 were obtained from clinically injured donors with acute diarrhea (AD) and 57 from clinically healthy donors without diarrhea (WD). Presumptive phenotypic species identification was carried out and confirmed by amplification of specific 16S ribosomal RNA encoding DNA. Multiplex PCR was performed to characterize the diarrheagenic E. coli strains. Drug susceptibility patterns were determined by the disc-diffusion method. In total, 220 strains were recovered from the fecal specimens (61.8% from AD and 38.2% from WD). Diarrheagenic E. coli was identified at a rate of 36.8% (n=50) in diarrheic feces and 29.8% (n=25) in non-diarrheic feces. Enteroaggregative E. coli was the most frequently identified pathotype in the AD group (16.2%) and the only pathotype identified in the WD group (30.9%). Enteropathogenic E. coli was the second most isolated pathotype (10.3%), followed by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (7.4%) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (2.9%). No enteroinvasive E. coli strains were recovered. The isolates showed high resistance rates against ampicillin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The most effective drugs were ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam, for which no resistance was observed. Differentiation between the diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes is of great importance since they are involved in acute diarrheal diseases and may require specific antimicrobial chemotherapy. The high antimicrobial resistance observed in our study raises a broad discussion on the indiscriminate or improper use of antimicrobials, besides the risks of self-medication.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the age-specific aetiologic agents of diarrhoea in children aged less than five years. The study also assessed the efficacy of the empiric treatment of childhood diarrhoea using Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. METHODS: This study included 280 children aged less than 5 years, admitted with diarrhoea to any of the four major hospitals in Dar es Salaam. Bacterial pathogens were identified using conventional methods. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and agglutination assay were used to detect viruses and intestinal protozoa, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: At least one of the searched pathogens was detected in 67.1% of the cases, and mixed infections were detected in 20.7% of cases. Overall, bacteria and viruses contributed equally accounting for 33.2% and 32.2% of all the cases, respectively, while parasites were detected in 19.2% patients. Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) was the most common enteric pathogen, isolated in 22.9% of patients, followed by Cryptosporidium parvum (18.9%), rotavirus (18.1%) and norovirus (13.7%). The main cause of diarrhoea in children aged 0 to 6 months were bacteria, predominantly DEC, while viruses predominated in the 7-12 months age group. Vibrio cholerae was isolated mostly in children above two years. Shigella spp, V. cholerae and DEC showed moderate to high rates of resistance to erythromycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline (56.2-100%). V. cholerae showed full susceptibility to co-trimoxazole (100%), while DEC and Shigella showed high rate of resistance to co-trimoxazole; 90.6% and 93.3% respectively. None of the bacterial pathogens isolated showed resistance to ciprofloxacin which is not recommended for use in children. Cefotaxime resistance was found only in 4.7% of the DEC. CONCLUSION: During the dry season, acute watery diarrhoea is the most common type of diarrhoea in children under five years in Dar es Salaam and is predominantly due to DEC, C. parvum, rotaviruses and noroviruses. Constant antibiotic surveillance is warranted as bacteria were highly resistant to various antimicrobial agents including co-trimoxazole and erythromycin which are currently recommended for empiric treatment of diarrhoea.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends rotavirus vaccines be included in all national immunization programs as part of a strategy to control diarrhoeal diseases. Sentinel surveillance is advised to monitor impact post-vaccine introduction and to document changes in genotype distribution. OBJECTIVES: To determine the molecular epidemiology of circulating rotaviruses in Hong Kong prior to implementation of universal rotavirus vaccination. STUDY DESIGN: From December 2004 through December 2007, 830 rotavirus-positive stool samples from subjects admitted for acute diarrhea to three major hospitals in Hong Kong were examined. The electropherotypes, and the G and P genotypes of these rotaviruses were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene was performed. RESULTS: G3P[8] was the dominant genotype (46.1%), followed by G1P[8] (36.5%) and G9P[8] (9.2%). A total of 35 electropherotypes were identified. The G3 and G1 strains had high sequence similarities among themselves and were clustered with strains from Asia particularly mainland China. The G9 strains were clustered with the globally spreading strains. G12 and G4 were not found. The prevalence of rotavirus infection peaked in winter season when temperature was low, atmospheric pressure was high, relative humidity was low and rainfall was negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Genotype G3 and G1 were the dominant rotaviruses circulating in Hong Kong between 2004 and 2007. Strains were mainly related with those from mainland China. Ongoing surveillance of circulating genotypes should continue in anticipation of universal rotavirus vaccine introduction.",

			"abstract": "To study human rotaviruses in Cuban children up to 5 years old with acute diarrhea, a total of 64 faecal samples from two pediatric hospitals between 2006 and 2008 were analyzed. Thirty-nine samples (60.9%) were found positive for rotaviruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), while four (6.2%) exhibited discordant results (ELISA positives/PAGE negatives). All the positive samples were genotyped by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The most prevalent G and P types were G1 (60.5%) and P[8] (90.6%), respectively. Among the rotaviruses detected, two long RNA patterns were identified by PAGE (L/A and L/B). The predominant genotype in 2006 and 2007 was G1/P[8] with detection rates 71.4% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, G9/P[8] was found at the highest rate (78.5%) in 2008. The phylogenetic analysis of VP7 genes of the ten representative strains indicated that Cuban G1/P[8] rotaviruses were close to those reported in the Americas, and G9/P[8] rotaviruses were located in the lineage of the emerging G9 strains spreading worldwide. This is the first molecular epidemiologic study of rotaviruses in Cuba, highlighting the current increase of the G9 rotavirus which has been recognized globally as an emerging genotype. The study reinforces the need for a systematic surveillance of the molecular epidemiology of rotaviruses.",

While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. Diversity of RAPD types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical transfer of intestinal LAB from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.",

			"article_name": "Faecal calprotectin concentrations in apparently healthy children aged 0-12 years in urban Kampala, Uganda: a community-based survey.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calprotectin is a calcium and zinc binding protein, abundant in neutrophils and is extremely stable in faeces. Faecal calprotectin is used as a non-specific marker for gastrointestinal inflammation. It has a good diagnostic precision to distinguish between irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Studies have established normal concentrations in healthy children; all these studies have been performed in high-income countries. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration of faecal calprotectin in apparently healthy children aged 0-12 years in urban Kampala, Uganda. METHOD: We tested 302 apparently healthy children aged, age 0-12 years (162 female, 140 male) in urban Kampala, Uganda. The children were recruited consecutively by door-to-door visits. Faecal calprotectin was analyzed using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Faeces were also tested for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antigen, for growth of enteropathogens and microscopy was performed to assess protozoa and helminths. A short standardized interview with socio-demographic information and medical history was obtained to assess health status of the children. RESULTS: In the different age groups the median faecal calprotectin concentrations were 249 mg/kg in 0 < 1 year (n = 54), 75 mg/kg in 1 < 4 years (n = 89) and 28 mg/kg in 4 < 12 years (n = 159). There was no significant difference in faecal calprotectin concentrations and education of female caretaker, wealth index, gender, habits of using mosquito nets, being colonized with H. pylori or having other pathogens in the stool. CONCLUSION: Concentrations of faecal calprotectin among healthy children, living in urban Ugandan, a low-income country, are comparable to those in healthy children living in high-income countries. In children older than 4 years, the faecal calprotectin concentration is low. In healthy infants faecal calprotectin is high. The suggested cut-off concentrations in the literature can be used in apparently healthy Ugandan children. This finding also shows that healthy children living under poor circumstances do not have a constant inflammation in the gut. We see an opportunity to use this relatively inexpensive test for further understanding and investigations of gut inflammation in children living in low-income countries.",

Here we have studied the biophysical mechanisms of how meconium affects surface activity of pulmonary surfactant and whether the membrane-perturbing effects of meconium can be mimicked by exposure of surfactant to a mixture of bile acids and cholesterol. Surface activity of pulmonary surfactant complexes purified from animal lungs was analyzed in the absence and in the presence of meconium in standard surface balances and in a captive bubble surfactometer. We have also evaluated accumulation of surfactant at the air-liquid interface by what we believe to be a novel microtiter plate fluorescent assay, and the effect of meconium components on surfactant membrane fluidity using Laurdan fluorescence thermotropic profiles and differential scanning calorimetry thermograms. Rapid interfacial adsorption, low surface tension upon film compression, efficient film replenishment upon expansion, and thermotropic properties of surfactant complexes are all adversely affected by meconium, and, in a similar manner, they are affected by cholesterol/taurocholate mixtures but not by taurocholate alone. We conclude that inhibition of surfactant by meconium can be mimicked by a bile salt-promoted incorporation of excess cholesterol into surfactant complexes. These results highlight the potential pathogenic role of cholesterol-mobilizing agents as a crucial factor resulting in cholesterol induced alterations of structure and dynamics of surfactant membranes and films.",

The demonstrated safety and efficacy of the live-attenuate human rotavirus vaccines in several clinical trials worldwide has accelerated such initiatives. Although the percentage-mortality rates for Sierra Leone are top of the list for rotavirus-associated deaths in Africa, no study has reported the prevalent strains circulating within this country. In this study, stool specimens were collected from 128 Sierra Leonean children presenting with diarrhea in 2005. Almost 37.5% (48/128) were rotavirus positive by EIA, of which 89.6% (43/48) revealed a short electropherotype, and a further 6.98% (3/48) could not be assigned a PAGE pattern. Genotyping analysis revealed G2P[4] (30.23%), G2P[6] (13.95%), G8P[6] (11.63%), G2P[8] (4.65%), G8P[4] (4.65%), and G8P[8] (2%) strains. About 11% were only assigned VP7 genotypes (G2), while 20.9% had mixed G and P types. The frequent detection of G2 rotaviruses could be of concern considering data generated from some studies that suggests lower efficacy of Rotarix(R) vaccine against G2 rotaviruses. This underscores the need for extensive and continuous regional strain surveillance to support rotavirus vaccines introduction and guide future vaccine development efforts. Such information will be useful before considering administration of specific rotavirus vaccine candidates in countries like Sierra Leone where little is known about circulating rotavirus strains.",

Longitudinal latent growth curve (LLGC) modeling of the data revealed an association between PCE (measured dichotomously as yes/no) and lower functioning in expressive and total language scores, after considering other sources of variation including child's age at testing, sex, prenatal exposure to alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco, and additional medical and social-demographic covariates. Analyses of level of PCE showed a gradient, i.e. dose-dependent, relationship between PCE level and expressive, receptive, and total language scores in the models controlling for age, child's sex, and other prenatal drug exposures. With additional covariate control these findings were most stable for the total language score. The evidence supports an inference about an enduring stable cocaine-specific effect on children's language abilities, with no effect on language growth over time in the longitudinal trajectory of language development.",

This study was carried out to characterize the diversity and number of bifidobacteria colonizing the gut in Indian neonates and to investigate whether asymptomatic infection with rotavirus in the first month of life affected gut colonization by bifidobacteria. METHODS: DNA was isolated from faeces of 14 term-born neonates who were under surveillance for rotavirus infection. Bacterial and bifidobacterial diversity was evaluated by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (TTGE) of 16S rDNA amplified using total bacteria and bifidobacteria-specific primers. Real time PCR, targeting 16S rDNA, was used to quantitate faecal bifidobacteria and enterobacteria. RESULTS: TTGE of conserved bacterial 16S rDNA showed 3 dominant bands of which Escherichia coli (family Enterobacteriaceae) and Bifidobacterium (family Bifidobacteriaceae) were constant. TTGE of Bifidobacterium genus-specific DNA showed a single band in all neonates identified by sequencing as Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis. Faecal bifidobacterial counts (log 10 cfu/g faeces) ranged from 6.1 to 9.3 and enterobacterial counts from 6.3 to 9.5.

RESULTS: There was no difference in cell death between saline and milk groups. However, meconium caused a significant cell loss compared to saline and milk-Inflammatory cytokines increased significantly in meconium group compared to saline or milk group.

We previously reported a trend toward lower endogenous infection morbidity after enteral supplementation of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides (SC GOS/LC FOS/AOS).

Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of enteral supplementation of prebiotics on intestinal inflammation, as measured by fecal IL-8 (f-IL-8) and calprotectin (f-calprotectin), in preterm infants. In a randomized controlled trial, infants with a GA <32 wk and/or birth weight <1,500 g received enteral supplementation of prebiotics or placebo (maltodextrin) between d 3 and 30 of life.

Baseline patient and nutritional characteristics were not different in the SC GOS/LC FOS/AOS (n = 55) and the placebo group (n = 58). Enteral supplementation of prebiotics had no effect on f-IL-8 and f-calprotectin. F-IL-8 and f-calprotectin were strongly correlated at all time points (p < 0.001).

			"abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate a possible association between human parechovirus infections in early infancy, diagnosed in fecal samples, and the development of islet autoimmunity. In the 'Environmental Triggers of Type 1 Diabetes: The MIDIA study', newborns with the highest genetic risk for type 1 diabetes were identified and followed with regular fecal sampling and questionnaires. A nested case-control study, including 27 children who developed islet autoimmunity (repeatedly positive for two or three autoantibodies) and 53 children matched for age and community of residence was used. Monthly stool samples from these children were analyzed for human parechovirus using a semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of human parechovirus in stool samples when cases and controls were compared: 13.0 and 11.1%, respectively. There was also not any difference as to the number of infection episodes. In analyses restricted to samples collected 3, 6 or 12 months prior to seroconversion for islet autoantibodies, there was a suggestive association in the shortest time window of 3 months (20.8 vs. 8.8%, odds ratio = 3.2, 95% CI 1.2 - 8.5, uncorrected p = 0.022). No symptoms were associated with human parechovirus infection. A subset of the positive samples (n = 31) were sequenced, suggesting that human parechovirus 1 was the dominant genotype. The present study does not support strong associations between human parechovirus infections and the signs of islet autoimmunity. The weak association of parechovirus present in the last 3 months before development of autoimmunity warrants further investigation.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Enteric pathogens have been implicated in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but increased rates of stool testing of patients with unclear gastrointestinal symptoms might cause detection bias. Hence, the objective of this study was to analyse incidence rates of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis among patients with Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive and negative stool tests and to study the incidence of positive and negative stool tests among patients already diagnosed with IBD. METHODS: The Danish population was followed for 94.3 million person-years during 1992-2008 using national registers to identify persons with positive and negative stool tests and patients with IBD. Using Poisson regression, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for IBD after positive or negative stool tests and, conversely, IRRs for positive and negative stool tests following IBD, were calculated. RESULTS: IRRs for IBD were significantly high in the first year after Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive stool tests (IRRs 5.4-9.8), and they remained moderately increased 1-10 years later (IRRs 1.6-2.2), and less so >10 years later (IRRs 0.8-1.8). However, IRRs for IBD <1 year after a negative stool test were several-fold higher (IRRs 53.2-57.5), and a decreasing incidence pattern over time was parallel to that following positive test results. Among patients with IBD, IRRs for subsequent positive and-most notably-negative stool test results were also significantly high. CONCLUSION: Similarities in temporal risk patterns for IBD following positive or negative stool tests indicate that the increased occurrence of Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive results around the time of first IBD hospitalisation results from detection bias.",

			"abstract": "The intestinal microbiome is a critical determinant of human health. Alterations in its composition have been correlated with chronic disorders, such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease in adults, and may be associated with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Increasing evidence suggests that strain-level genomic variation may underpin distinct ecological trajectories within mixed populations, yet there have been few strain-resolved analyses of genotype-phenotype connections in the context of the human ecosystem. Here, we document strain-level genomic divergence during the first 3 wk of life within the fecal microbiota of an infant born at 28-wk gestation. We observed three compositional phases during colonization, and reconstructed and intensively curated population genomic datasets from the third phase. The relative abundance of two Citrobacter strains sharing ~99% nucleotide identity changed significantly over time within a community dominated by a nearly clonal Serratia population and harboring a lower abundance Enterococcus population and multiple plasmids and bacteriophage. Modeling of Citrobacter strain abundance suggests differences in growth rates and host colonization patterns. We identified genotypic variation potentially responsible for divergent strain ecologies, including hotspots of sequence variation in regulatory genes and intergenic regions, and in genes involved in transport, flagellar biosynthesis, substrate metabolism, and host colonization, as well as differences in the complements of these genes. Our results demonstrate that a community genomic approach can elucidate gut microbial colonization at the resolution required to discern medically relevant strain and species population dynamics, and hence improve our ability to diagnose and treat microbial community-mediated disorders.",

			"article_name": "Clostridium difficile colonization in early infancy is accompanied by changes in intestinal microbiota composition.",
			"abstract": "Clostridium difficile is a major enteric pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Host susceptibility to C. difficile infections results partly from inability of the intestinal microbiota to resist C. difficile colonization. During early infancy, asymptomatic colonization by C. difficile is common and the intestinal microbiota shows low complexity. Thus, we investigated the potential relationship between the microbiota composition and the implantation of C. difficile in infant gut. Fecal samples from 53 infants, ages 0 to 13 months, 27 negative and 26 positive for C. difficile, were studied. Dominant microbiota profiles were assessed by PCR-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Bacterial signatures of the intestinal microbiota associated with colonization by C. difficile were deciphered using principal component analysis (PCA). Resulting bands of interest in TTGE profiles were excised, sequenced, and analyzed by nucleotide BLAST (NCBI). While global biodiversity was not affected, interclass PCA on instrumental variables highlighted significant differences in dominant bacterial species between C. difficile-colonized and noncolonized infants (P = 0.017). Four bands were specifically associated with the presence or absence of C. difficile: 16S rRNA gene sequences related to Ruminococcus gnavus and Klebsiella pneumoniae for colonized infants and to Bifidobacterium longum for noncolonized infants. We demonstrated that the presence of C. difficile in the intestinal microbiota of infants was associated with changes in this ecosystem's composition. These results suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota might be crucial in the colonization process, although the chronology of events remains to be determined.",

			"abstract": "PURPOSE: The stability of extemporaneously prepared acetylcysteine 1% and 10% solutions for treatment of meconium ileus was evaluated. METHODS: Acetylcysteine 1% (10-mg/mL) and 10% (100-mg/mL) solutions were prepared by mixing 3 and 10 mL, respectively, of commercially available 20% acetylcysteine solution with a sufficient quantity of bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride for injection to make a final volume of 60 mL. Three identical samples of each concentration were prepared, placed in 2-oz amber plastic prescription bottles, and stored at 20-25  degrees C. Samples were assayed in duplicate using high-performance liquid chromatography and inspected for changes in color, odor, and pH immediately after preparation and at 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days. Stability was defined as retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration. RESULTS: At least 90% of the initial concentration of acetylcysteine was retained in both formulations for 60 days. No appreciable change from the initial pH occurred in the acetylcysteine 1% or 10% solution during the first 60 days, but there was a notable change in pH after 90 days in both formulations. Neither solution was stable at day 90. There was no detectable change in color at 90 days; however, the odor of hydrogen sulfide was more pungent than on previous study days. CONCLUSION: Extemporaneously prepared solutions of acetylcysteine 1% (10 mg/mL) and 10% (100 mg/mL) prepared with bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride for injection were stable for at least 60 days when stored in plastic amber bottles at room temperature.",

			"article_name": "Antibiotics for meconium-stained amniotic fluid in labour for preventing maternal and neonatal infections.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis is more likely to occur when meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is present. Meconium may enhance the growth of bacteria in amniotic fluid by serving as a growth factor, inhibiting bacteriostatic properties of amniotic fluid. Many adverse neonatal outcomes related to MSAF result from Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS). MSAF is associated with both maternal and newborn infections. Antibiotics may be an effective option to reduce such morbidity. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and side effects of prophylactic antibiotics for MSAF during labour in preventing maternal and neonatal infections. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment during labour for women with MSAF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the results of the only available trial and extracted data on maternal and neonatal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: We included one study with 120 pregnant women. It compared ampicillin-salbactam (N = 60) versus normal saline (N = 60) in pregnant women with MSAF. Prophylactic antibiotics appeared to have no statistically significant reduction in the incidence of neonatal sepsis (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.76), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.78) and postpartum endometritis (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.38). However, significant decrease in the risk of chorioamnionitis (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.82). No serious adverse effects were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence indicates that compared to placebo, antibiotics for MSAF in labour may reduce chorioamnionitis. There was no evidence that antibiotics could reduce postpartum endometritis, neonatal sepsis and NICU admission. This systematic review identifies the need for more well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to assess the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in the incidence of maternal and neonatal complications.",

A limitation of previous studies is that they are based on infants who have been subject to factors, which can have a profound disruptive effect on the natural colonization process. We describe the colonization process, during the first 4 months after birth, in 85 infants who have experienced no major medical or dietary interventions. They were all vaginally delivered, healthy, term infants, who were not exposed to antibiotics, exclusively breastfed during their first month of life and at least partially breastfed up to 4 months. Selected microbial groups were identified by targeting small subunit microbial ribosomal RNA genes. In contrast to more recent studies, but in agreement with older studies, almost all our infants harbored gamma-Proteobacteria and Bifidobacterium. Yet undefined non-cultivable species belonging to Bacteroides, as well as microbes identified as Lachnospiraceae 2, were common. Strong associations were observed between some specific constituents of microbiota at day 4 and the concentration of specific microbial groups at day 120, indicating that early gut microbiota may influence later microbiota. Novel information of the undisturbed composition of early gut microbiota in babies is presented.",

			"abstract": "In Taiwan, a screening system using an infant stool color card to promote the early diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA) was established in 2002. This study aimed to investigate the 5-year outcome of BA before and after using the screening program. BA patients were divided into three cohorts according to their birth dates. The patients in cohort A (n = 89) were born before the stool card screening program (1990-2000); those in cohort B (n = 28) were screened by the stool card regional screening program (2002-2003); and those in cohort C (n = 74) were screened by the stool card universal screening program (2004-2005). The relative odds ratios were computed using logistic regression to compare the different factors affecting survival time. The rate of age at Kasai operation <60 days was 49.4% and 65.7% in cohorts A and B+C, respectively (P = 0.02). The jaundice-free (total serum bilirubin <2.0 mg/dL) rate 3 months after surgery was 34.8% and 60.8% in cohorts A and B+C, respectively (P < 0.001). The 3-year jaundice-free survival rate with native liver was 31.5% in cohort A and 56.9% in cohort B+C (P < 0.001), whereas the 3-year overall survival rates were 64.0% and 89.2%, respectively (P < 0.001). The 5-year jaundice-free survival rate with native liver was 27.3% in cohort A and 64.3% in cohort B (P < 0.001), and the 5-year overall survival rates were 55.7% and 89.3%, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The stool color card screening program for BA allows for earlier Kasai operation, which increases the jaundice-free rate at 3 months postsurgery. With higher surgical success rates, the 3- and 5-year outcome of BA patients in Taiwan improves remarkably.",

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic surveillance of rotavirus diarrhea was conducted in inpatient wards and outpatient department from January 2007 to December 2008 in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. All stool specimens were tested for rotavirus by latex agglutination test. RESULTS: 46,499 stool samples were collected and 15,649 (33.7%) were tested positive for rotavirus. Positive rate for rotavirus was highest among children aged 12-24 months (39.0-39.6%). 92.4% children with rotavirus infection were <2 years, with constitution ratios of 21.8%, 41.8%, 21.8%, 8.4% and 6.2% in children aged 0-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-18 months, 19-24 months and >24 months, respectively.

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the United States and elsewhere, recreational water quality is monitored for fecal indicator bacteria to help prevent swimming-associated illnesses. Standard methods to measure these bacteria take at least 24 hours to obtain results. Molecular approaches such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) can estimate these bacteria faster, in under 3 hours. Previously, we demonstrated that measurements of the fecal indicator bacteria Enterococcus using qPCR were associated with gastrointestinal (GI) illness among swimmers at freshwater beaches. In this paper, we report on results from three marine beach sites. METHODS: We interviewed beach-goers and collected water samples at marine beaches affected by treated sewage discharges in Mississippi in 2005, and Rhode Island and Alabama in 2007. Ten to twelve days later, we obtained information about gastrointestinal, respiratory, eye, ear and skin symptoms by telephone. We tested water samples for fecal indicator organisms using qPCR and other methods. RESULTS: We enrolled 6,350 beach-goers. The occurrence of GI illness among swimmers was associated with a log10-increase in exposure to qPCR-determined estimates of fecal indicator organisms in the genus Enterococcus (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.1) and order Bacteroidales (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9). Estimates of organisms related to Clostridium perfringens and a subgroup of organisms in the genus Bacteroides were also determined by qPCR in 2007, as was F+ coliphage, but relationships between these indicators and illness were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of a relationship between gastrointestinal illness and estimates of fecal indicator organisms determined by qPCR at marine beaches.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus gastroenteritis results in significant morbidity and mortality in Indian children. Although there are numerous studies on rotavirus diarrhea, there are few reports on antigenemia and extraintestinal presentations in these populations. METHODS: Following screening for rotavirus antigen of stool samples from children with and without acute gastroenteritis with a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA), a total of 199 stool and serum sample pairs were identified for additional testing. All EIA-positive stool samples were genotyped, and viral load estimated by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples were tested for rotavirus antigen by an in-house EIA, and antigen was quantified by optical density. Scoring of disease severity was performed for all hospitalized children. Data on extra-intestinal presentations were collected if available. RESULTS: Based on screening of stool samples by EIA, the study population could be divided into 3 groups, including 111 children with rotavirus diarrhea, 44 children with diarrhea and no rotavirus detected in stool specimens, and 44 children with asymptomatic rotavirus infection. Antigenemia was significantly higher among children with rotavirus diarrhea (50.4%) than among children with non-rotaviral diarrhea (16%) or asymptomatic infections (2.3%) (P < .001). Low copies of rotavirus were detected by RT-PCR in all 7 children with EIA-negative stool specimens and antigenemia. Presence and levels of rotavirus antigen in serum specimens correlated with stool viral load. Children with antigenemia had significantly more-severe disease but not more extraintestinal presentations than did children without antigenemia. CONCLUSIONS: Antigenemia occurs frequently in rotavirus infection and correlates with virus replication in the gut but not with extra-intestinal presentations.",

IHPS is known to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but its precise causes and pathophysiology are poorly understood. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts in children with IHPS. Nasopharyngeal fluids, stools, vomit, and surgical pyloric muscle fragments and swabs were tested by cell culture, viral antigen assay and PCR. IHPS was diagnosed in 23 boys and 8 girls with a mean (+/- SD) age of 42 +/- 15 days (range 20-88 days). There was no seasonal pattern of diagnosis. Twenty-two children (71%) lost weight (mean 246 +/- 164 g, range 30-600 g) after the onset of vomiting, and five (16.1%) were dehydrated. Seven (22.6%) infants had been exposed to an infectious contact within 15 days before admission, and one on the day of admission (3.2%).

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Newborns display high intestinal permeability and a naive adaptive immune system, but infections are rare, indicating strong innate defense mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: To measure the kinetics of fecal beta-defensin-2 (HBD2), an inducible endogenous antimicrobial peptide produced by intestinal epithelial cells, in full-term and preterm infants. METHODS: As a first step of this bicentric study, we enrolled 30 healthy full-term infants and 20 healthy preterm infants, with fecal samples collected at days 3, 7, 12 and 30 in full-term infants and at days 15, 30 and 60 in preterm infants. As a second step, we enrolled 10 preterm infants with intestinal distress, either necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) Bell's stage III (n = 3) or isolated rectal bleeding (n = 7) and 20 controls, cross-matched for gestational age and age at sampling. RESULTS: HBD2 decreased significantly from day 3 to day 7 (227 ng/g; 14-440 vs. 117 ng/g; 30-470, p = 0.01) then moderately until day 30 (84 ng/g; 10-500) in healthy full-term infants. Healthy preterm infants showed similar high levels between days 15 and 60 (82 ng/g; 30-154 and 85 ng/g; 26-390, respectively). No significant variation of fecal HBD2 levels was observed between infants with clinical features of intestinal distress (77 ng/g, 2-1,271) and cross-matched controls (56 ng/g, 31-164). However, 2/3 infants with NEC and 1/7 infants with isolated rectal bleeding had HBD2 levels above the maximal level observed in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics of fecal HBD2 in the neonatal period indicate that this inducible defensin can be detected at high level in the feces of full-term and preterm infants, independently of gestational age or mode of feeding. The potential role of fecal HBD2 in detecting NEC is suggested.",

However, the genetic basis of adaptation of bifidobacteria to the human gut is poorly understood. Analysis of the 2,214,650-bp genome of Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010, a strain isolated from infant stool, revealed a nutrient-acquisition strategy that targets host-derived glycans, such as those present in mucin. Proteome and transcriptome profiling revealed a set of chromosomal loci responsible for mucin metabolism that appear to be under common transcriptional control and with predicted functions that allow degradation of various O-linked glycans in mucin. Conservation of the latter gene clusters in various B. bifidum strains supports the notion that host-derived glycan catabolism is an important colonization factor for B. bifidum with concomitant impact on intestinal microbiota ecology.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine baseline clinical characteristics that influence bacterial gut flora dynamics in very preterm infants and the relationship between gut flora dynamics and clinical evolution. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, monocentric study enrolling 29 consecutive very preterm infants. We collected data about growth, digestive tolerance, nutrition, and antibiotic use. Microflora in stool samples, collected between 3 and 56 days of life, was identified with direct molecular fingerprinting. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) body weight and gestational age at birth were 950 g (760-1060 g) and 27 weeks (27-29 weeks), respectively. The diversity score (number of operational taxonomic units) increased 0.45 units/week (P < .0001), with staphylococci as the major group. Bifidobacterium was poorly represented. Gestational age (>/= 28 weeks) and caesarean delivery independently correlated with better diversity scores during follow-up (P < .05). The 6-week diversity score inversely correlated with the duration of antibiotherapy (P = .0184) and parenteral feeding (P = .013). The microflora dynamics was associated with the digestive tolerance profile. Weight gain increased with increasing diversity score (P = .0428). CONCLUSION: Microflora diversity settled progressively in very preterm infants. Staphylococci were the major group, and few infants were colonized with Bifidobacterium spp. Measures that may improve microflora could have beneficial effects on digestive tolerance and growth.",

At 40-55 days, we examined the infants and gave mothers a questionnaire, including crying characteristics of the infants; 47 infants were diagnosed with colic and 142 as non-colic. When the infants were 7-8 months old, another interview was done. The colic group had higher proportions of less-educated (</= 8 years) and smoking mothers, extended family and families with domestic violence than the non-colic group. The colic group of mothers had significantly higher rates of 'impaired bonding' in the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire, higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, higher scores for hostility subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory and a more irregular sleep pattern than the non-colic group. No differences were revealed for faecal enzyme activities. At 7-8 months, the colic group was shorter than the non-colic group. Colic was associated with various perinatal factors (maternal education, smoking habits, cheese consumption, hostility scores and domestic violence) and having colic in infancy negatively affected the sleeping pattern and the height of the infant.",

The current NoV prevalence and circulating genotypes are unknown. SA lacks NoV outbreak reporting systems and therefore the number and impact of NoV infections is underestimated. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of NoV infections in hospitalised paediatric patients with gastroenteritis in SA during 2008. STUDY DESIGN: Stool specimens referred for virological analysis from hospitalised children </=13 years, with gastroenteritis, were screened for rotavirus, human adenovirus and human astrovirus by enzyme immunoassay and for NoV genogroup I (GI), II (GII) and sapovirus by real-time RT-PCR. NoV strains were genotyped, and variants identified, based on sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 5' end or the full length of the capsid gene, respectively. RESULTS: Rotavirus was the most prevalent virus detected in 24.2% (61/252) of specimens, followed by NoV in 14.3% (35/245) and adenovirus, astrovirus and sapovirus in 9.6%, 6.7% and 4% of specimens, respectively. NoVs were only detected in children </=2 years. The GII NoVs (89%) predominated and eight types were identified with GII.4 (43%) detected most frequently. The emerging 2008 GII.4 variant represented 80% of the GII.4 strains. CONCLUSIONS: A diverse range of NoV genotypes were identified in hospitalised children with gastroenteritis. The 2008 GII.4 variant was the most frequently detected strain in the study. This is the first report of NoV GII.4 viruses in SA.",

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 109 newborn 1-month-old infants were assigned randomly to a probiotic group receiving a BB-12-containing tablet (n 55) or to a control group receiving a control tablet (n 54). Test tablets were administered to the infants twice a day (daily dose of BB-12 10 billion colony-forming units) from the age of 1-2 months to 8 months with a novel slow-release pacifier or a spoon. Breastfeeding habits, pacifier use, dietary habits, medications and all signs and symptoms of acute infections were registered. At the age of 8 months, faecal samples were collected for BB-12 determination (quantitative PCR method). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar, as was the duration of exclusive breastfeeding. BB-12 was recovered (detection limit log 5) in the faeces of 62% of the infants receiving the BB-12 tablet. The daily duration of pacifier sucking was not associated with the occurrence of acute otitis media. No significant differences between the groups were observed in reported gastrointestinal symptoms, otitis media or use of antibiotics. However, the infants receiving BB-12 were reported to have experienced fewer respiratory infections (65 v. 94%; risk ratio 0.69; 95% CI 0.53, 0.89; P = 0.014) than the control infants.

This research evaluated whether quantification of fetal methadone and drug exposure via meconium would reflect maternal dose and predict neonatal outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: An urban drug treatment facility treating pregnant and post-partum women and their children. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine opioid-dependent pregnant women received 30-110 mg methadone daily. MEASUREMENTS: Maternal methadone dose, infant birth parameters and NAS assessments were extracted from medical records. Thrice-weekly urine specimens were screened for opioids and cocaine. Newborn meconium specimens were quantified for methadone, opioid, cocaine and tobacco biomarkers. FINDINGS: There was no relationship between meconium methadone concentrations, presence of opioids, cocaine and/or tobacco in meconium, maternal methadone dose or NAS severity. Opioid and cocaine were also found in 36.7 and 38.8 of meconium specimens, respectively, and were associated with positive urine specimens in the third trimester. The presence of opioids other than methadone in meconium correlated with increased rates of preterm birth, longer infant hospital stays and decreased maternal time in drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Methadone and its metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) concentrations in meconium did not predict infant birth parameters or NAS severity. Prospective urine testing defined meconium drug detection windows for opiates and cocaine as 3 months, rather than the currently accepted 6 months. The presence of opioids in meconium could be used as a biomarker for infants at elevated risk in the newborn period.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been reported that deviations in gut microbiota composition may predispose toward obesity, and specific groups of commensal gut bacteria may harvest energy from food more efficiently than others. Alterations in microbiota compositions of mothers may be transferred to infants and lead to an increased risk of overweight. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the fecal microbiota composition of infants of overweight and normal-weight mothers and assessed the relations of weight and excessive weight gain of mothers during pregnancy on the microbiota of infants. DESIGN: Mothers (n = 16) whose prepregnancy body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was >/=25 were selected with their infants from a prospective follow-up study of 256 women. Women with a BMI <25 (n = 26) and their infants served as control subjects. At the ages of 1 and 6 mo, infant stool samples were available for the analysis of microbiota composition by fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Infants' fecal microbial composition was related to the weight and weight gain of their mothers during pregnancy. Fecal Bacteroides and Staphylococcus concentrations were significantly higher in infants of overweight mothers during the first 6 mo. Higher weights and BMIs of mothers were related to higher concentrations of Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus and lower concentrations of the Bifidobacterium group. Prevalences of Akkermansia muciniphila, Staphylococcus, and Clostridium difficile groups were lower in infants of normal-weight mothers and of mothers with normal weight gains during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The composition and development of infant gut microbiota are influenced by BMI, weight, and weight gain of mothers during pregnancy.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The heavy metals lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants with high neurotoxic potential. We aimed to compare perinatal Pb and Hg concentrations and to explore the potential association between Pb and Hg exposure and newborn anthropometry. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women were recruited in 2005 at the General Hospital Vienna for participation in this longitudinal study. Pb and Hg concentrations were measured in maternal blood and hair, placenta, cord blood, meconium, and breast milk of 53 mother-child pairs by CV-AAS, GF-AAS, and HPLC-CV-ICPMS. We conducted bivariate analyses and categorical regression analysis (CATREG) to evaluate the determinants of Pb and Hg exposure, and of infant anthropometry. RESULTS: Median Pb and total Hg contents were low, i.e., 25 mug/L (maternal blood-Pb), 13 mug/L (cord blood-Pb), 0.7 mug/L (maternal blood-Hg), and 1.1 mug/L (cord blood-Hg). Hg levels in maternal and fetal tissues were frequently correlated (r>0.3, P<0.05, respectively). Regarding Pb, only maternal blood and cord blood concentrations correlated (P=0.043). Cord blood levels indicated higher Hg exposure but lower Pb exposure relative to maternal blood contents. Adjusted CATREG models indicated the significant predictors of birth length (placenta-Pb, gestational length, meconium-Pb), birth weight (placenta-Pb, gestational length, maternal blood-Pb), and head circumference (maternal education, maternal height). Besides one significant correlation between maternal hair Hg and birth length, the mercury levels were not associated with newborn anthropometry. CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate that different modes of action may exist for placentar transfer of Pb and Hg as well as that low Pb exposure levels can result in lower birth weight. The findings related to newborn anthropometry need to be confirmed by the examination of larger study groups. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of Pb and Hg transfer via the placenta, and to explore how prenatal Pb exposure is related to intrauterine growth.",

RESULTS: During the neonatal period, calprotectin levels are characterized by significantly higher values in both healthy full-term and preterm infants during their first year of life compared with reference values established for children and adults. No difference was observed according to gestational age or birth weight, whereas a higher faecal calprotectin level was detected during intestinal distress in neonates with either inflammatory or patent digestive alterations. Despite high interindividual variations, cutoff levels are proposed to identify infants with a high risk of intestinal illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with adults and children, healthy full-term and preterm neonates have high calprotectin levels. The measurement of calprotectin levels in faeces can be a promising noninvasive clinical screening test for intestinal distress in neonates.",

METHODOLOGY: A total of 991 blood samples were collected from patients in 2004 to 2005 and 641 fecal samples were collected from poultry farms in 2007. All Salmonella isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (4%) Salmonella isolates were obtained from human blood and 70 (11%) from chicken fecal samples. The human isolates revealed nine different serovars; 82% were non-typhoidal Salmonella and 18% were (S. Typhi). The majority of serovars from humans were S. Enteritidis (33%), S. Dublin (18%), and S. Typhimurium (18%). Resistance to chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and ampicillin ranged from 36% to 59% for the human isolates. Eight different serovars were obtained from chickens; S. Virchow (71%) predominated. A high frequency (87%) of reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was observed among the chicken isolates. A high frequency of resistance to tetracycline (93%), nalidixic acid (81%), and sulfamethoxazole (87%) was observed. Rare serovars such as S. Apapa, S. Mouschaui, S. Jukestown, S. Oritamerin, and S. Onireke were isolated from both humans and chickens. Identical serovars were not found among human and chicken isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that chickens are not a reservoir of Salmonella causing bacteraemia among humans in Ibadan, Nigeria. Studies locating the reservoirs responsible for invasive salmonellosis in humans are needed. Controls and targeted interventions against S. Virchow and the frequent occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in chickens should be initiated to prevent the spread of this serovar.",

Moreover, the prevalence of ESBL and CTX-M producers among all included patients was 15.8% and 5.9%, respectively. The clone E. coli O25b : H4-ST131 was detected in 63% of CTX-M strains. Surprisingly, 16 carbapenemases (5.3% of patients) were isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the wide dissemination of MDR bacteria, including carbapenemase producers, in a French hospital during a non-outbreak situation. Public health efforts to combat emergence and dissemination of MDR organisms need to be developed.",

			"abstract": "A major source of intestinal metabolites results from both host and microbial processing of dietary nutrients. (1)H NMR-based metabolic profiling of mouse feces was carried out over time in different microbiome mouse models, including conventional (n = 9), conventionalized (n = 10), and \"humanized\" gnotobiotic mice inoculated with a model of human baby microbiota (HBM, n = 17). HBM mice were supplemented with Lactobacillus paracasei with (n = 10) and without (n = 7) prebiotics. Animals not supplemented with prebiotics received a diet enriched in glucose and lactose as placebo. In conventionalized animals, microbial populations and activities converged in term of multivariate mapping toward conventional mice. Both groups decreased bacterial processing of dietary proteins when switching to a diet enriched in glucose and lactose, as described with low levels of 5-aminovalerate, acetate, and propionate and high levels of lysine and arginine. The HBM model differs from conventional and conventionalized microbiota in terms of type, proportion, and metabolic activity of gut bacteria (lower short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, 5-aminovalerate, and oligosaccharides, higher bile acids and choline). The probiotics supplementation of HBM mice was associated with a specific amino acid pattern that can be linked to L. paracasei proteolytic activities. The combination of L. paracasei with the galactosyl-oligosaccharide prebiotics was related to the enhanced growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, and a specific metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and SCFAs. The present study describes how the assessment of metabolic changes in feces may provide information for studying nutrient-microbiota relationships in different microbiome mouse models.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The evaluation of infant meconium as a cumulative matrix of prenatal toxicant exposure requires comparison to established biomarkers of prenatal exposure. METHODS: We calculated the frequency of detection and concentration of tobacco smoke metabolites measured in meconium (nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine concentrations) and three serial serum cotinine concentrations taken during the latter two-thirds of pregnancy among 337 mother-infant dyads. We estimated the duration and intensity of prenatal tobacco smoke exposure using serial serum cotinine concentrations and calculated geometric mean meconium tobacco smoke metabolite concentrations according to prenatal exposure. We also compared the estimated associations between these prenatal biomarkers and infant birth weight using linear regression. RESULTS: We detected nicotine (80%), cotinine (69%), and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (57%) in most meconium samples. Meconium tobacco smoke metabolite concentrations were positively associated with serum cotinine concentrations and increased with the number of serum cotinine measurements consistent with secondhand or active tobacco smoke exposure. Like serum cotinine, meconium tobacco smoke metabolites were inversely associated with birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Meconium is a useful biological matrix for measuring prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and could be used in epidemiological studies that enroll women and infants at birth. Meconium holds promise as a biological matrix for measuring the intensity and duration of environmental toxicant exposure and future studies should validate the utility of meconium using other environmental toxicants.",

Human-made lakes in the U.S. have received little attention in epidemiology studies despite contributing to more waterborne disease epidemics annually than coastal U.S. waters. In a comprehensive beach cohort study, we examined relationships between water quality indicators and reported adverse health outcomes among users of a beach at an inland U.S. lake. Human health data was collected over 26 swimming days during the 2009 swimming season in conjunction with water quality measurements. Adverse health outcomes were reported 8-9 days post-exposure via a phone survey. Wading, playing or swimming in the water was observed to be a significant risk factor for GI illness (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 3.2; CI 1.1, 9.0). Among water users, Escherichia coli density was significantly associated with elevated GI illness risk where the highest E. coli quartile was associated with an AOR of 7.0 (CI 1.5, 32). GI illness associations are consistent with previous freshwater epidemiology studies. Our findings are unique in that our observations of positive associations with GI illness risk are based upon a single daily E. coli measurement. Lastly, this study focused on an understudied issue, illness risk at inland reservoirs. Our results support the usefulness of E. coli as a health-relevant indicator of water quality for this inland U.S. beach.",

Based on stool examinations of two Kato-Katz smears of a single sample, the prevalences of schistosomiasis and geohelminths were established. In a multivariable analysis, sets of demographic, socio-economic and water contact pattern variables were tested for strength of relation with infection. Males presented a 3.39-times higher risk for infection than females. The age groups between 10-19 years and 20-30 years showed risks of infection 7.1- and 7.5-times higher, respectively, than the control age group between 0-10 years. Individuals practicing leisure activities had a 1.96-times higher risk than those without these activities. The malacological survey identified snails of the species Biomphalaria glabrata, Biomphalaria straminea and Biomphalaria tenagophila. Two exemplars of B. glabrata (0.53%) proved positive for S. mansoni. The socio-economic improvements observed in the locality suggest a protective and preventive effect towards infection with schistosomiasis, which requires further investigation with a longitudinal and more detailed study design. Considering our findings, a proposal for an integrated control program should be based on two pillars: one horizontal, which involves social empowerment and health education, and another more vertical, which delivers treatment and infrastructure improvements.",

Parasitological data were drawn from baseline stool surveys of whole populations that were obtained to diagnose Schistosoma mansoni infection. Nineteen representative localities were selected for assessing the prevalence of schistosomiasis among individuals in the following age groups: 0-5, 6-15, 16-25, 26-40 and 41-80 years. For each locality, the prevalence in each age group was compared to that of the overall population using contingency table analysis. To select a reference group, the operational difficulties of conducting residential surveys were considered. School-aged children may be considered to be the group of choice as the reference group for the overall population for the following reasons: (i) the prevalence of schistosomiasis in this age group had the highest correlation with the prevalence in the overall population (r = 0.967), (ii) this age group is particularly vulnerable to infection and plays an important role in parasite transmission and (iii) school-aged children are the main target of the World Health Organization in terms of helminth control. The Schistosomiasis Control Program should consider school-aged children both as a reference group for assessing the need for intervention at the community level and as a target group for integrated health care actions of the Unified Health System that are focused on high-risk groups.",

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty exclusively breastfed colicky infants, diagnosed according to modified Wessel's criteria, were randomly assigned to receive either L reuteri DSM 17 938 (10(8) colony-forming units) or placebo daily for 21 days. Parental questionnaires monitored daily crying time and adverse effects. Stool samples were collected for microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six infants (L reuteri group: 25; placebo group: 21) completed the trial. Daily crying times in minutes/day (median [interquartile range]) were 370 (120) vs 300 (150) (P=.127) on day 0 and 35.0 (85) vs 90.0 (148) (P=.022) on day 21, in the L reuteri and placebo groups, respectively. Responders (50% reduction in crying time from baseline) were significantly higher in the L reuteri group versus placebo group on days 7 (20 vs 8; P=.006), 14 (24 vs 13; P=.007), and 21 (24 vs 15; P=.036). During the study, there was a significant increase in fecal lactobacilli (P=.002) and a reduction in fecal Escherichia coli and ammonia in the L reuteri group only (P=.001). There were no differences in weight gain, stooling frequency, or incidence of constipation or regurgitation between groups, and no adverse events related to the supplementation were observed. CONCLUSION: L. reuteri DSM 17 938 at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per day in early breastfed infants improved symptoms of infantile colic and was well tolerated and safe. Gut microbiota changes induced by the probiotic could be involved in the observed clinical improvement.",

			"abstract": "Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol, and elevated levels of FAEE in meconium are a useful biomarker for heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. FAEE in meconium has been recommended as useful and cost-effective for universal screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. To support an efficient universal screening program, an analytical method to detect and quantify FAEE in meconium needs to be accurate, inexpensive, and rapid. The purpose of this study was to develop an analytical method that would satisfy these criteria and to validate this method using established laboratory guidelines. A method was developed and validated to detect and quantify four FAEEs (ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate) from 0.5 g of meconium using d(5)-ethyl esters as internal standards. The sample undergoes liquid-liquid extraction with heptane:acetone, the heptane layer is isolated and evaporated, and then, the resulting residue undergoes headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The detection limits of the four FAEEs ranged from 0.020 to 0.042 nmol/g and are 6- to 25-fold lower than the individual FAEE threshold concentrations (0.5 nmol/g). This method also has good precision with the coefficient of variation ranging from 2.6 to 19.4% for concentrations of individual FAEE between 0.5 and 2.62 nmol/g meconium (n=4). Calculated concentrations of FAEE that underwent extraction from meconium were 100-101% of the expected concentration, demonstrating the accuracy of the method. The peak shape and retention time of each FAEE were unaffected by the presence of the matrix, and there is no carryover at clinically relevant concentrations. This method was also able to produce clean chromatograms from meconium samples that could not be quantified using a previous method because of high chromatographic background. This method provides an optimal approach to detecting and quantifying FAEE in meconium that could be used in a universal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure.",

A total of 309 fecal specimens were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and latex agglutination assay for the presence of group A rotavirus antigen. The detection rate was 26.2%. Rotavirus outbreaks showed a temperature-dependant pattern (P = .026) but no significant association with rainfall. Rotavirus strains isolated were analyzed by RNA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were characterized antigenically by monoclonal antibodies to the VP6 subgroup. Eight RNA electropherotypes were identified, with 3 long and 5 short different RNA profiles. Among VP6 typeable strains, all isolates with a long electrophoretic pattern carried the subgroup II specificity, whereas those with a short profile belonged to subgroup I. In total, 48 rotavirus-positive samples were analyzed for G and P typing by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. A total of 8 different G and P combinations were found: G1P[8] (35.7%), G1P[6] (21.4%), G2P[4] (4.8%), G3P[4] (4.8%), G4P[6] (4.8%), G8P[8] (4.8%), G3P[8] (2.3%), and G4P[8] (2.3%).

Further investigation of the polymerase chain reaction G-typing results with a second set of primers revealed that the specimens were not genotype G3, and both samples were sequenced to elucidate the problem. Both strains were found to be genotype G10 by nucleotide sequence. Comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences and phylogenetic analysis of the African G10 strains revealed that these strains are closely related to the human G10 strains that were detected during the 2001-2003 rotavirus season in Ghana.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nigeria has recently been ranked third among the 10 countries with the greatest number of rotavirus disease-associated deaths per year. Estimates attribute up to 33,000 deaths annually to rotavirus disease in Nigerian children <5 years old. Although the introduction of the new oral, live attenuated rotavirus vaccines may not occur for another 4-6 years in developing countries, background data on burden of disease, cost of rotavirus disease, and characterization of circulating strains is required to hasten this introduction to children who would clearly benefit from the intervention. METHODS: Between July 2002 and July 2004, fecal specimens were collected from 869 infants and young children <5 years of age presenting with diarrhea in Kaduna, Kebbi, Sokoto, and Zamfara states in northwestern Nigeria. In addition, 194 control specimens were also collected from children matched for age. Specimens were screened for the presence of rotavirus antigens. Rotavirus-positive specimens were further analyzed to determine electropherotype, subgroup specificity, and G and P genotypes. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 18% of children with diarrhea and 7.2% of the age-matched case control subjects. The highest rotavirus burden was detected in children aged <6 months. The majority of the rotavirus-positive specimens revealed viruses of long electropherotypes, subgroup II specificity, and G1P[8] genotypes. Furthermore, more than a quarter of specimens (37%) displayed mixed G and P genotypes, and almost a third could not be genotyped. CONCLUSIONS: The high numbers of mixed rotavirus infections highlight the multitude of enteric pathogens to which children in African countries are exposed. Data on circulating rotavirus strains serve to inform African government officials to the serious health threat posed by rotavirus in their respective countries and to document the diversity of strains before vaccine introduction.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines will be dependent on the immunity conferred against prevalent and emergent variants causing severe diarrheal disease. Longitudinal surveillance of disease-causing strains is a prerequisite to intervention. METHODS: Molecular characterization was conducted on rotavirus-positive stool samples from children admitted with diarrhea to a rural district hospital during 2002-2004. Extracted viral RNA was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and rotavirus VP4 (P types) and VP7 (G types) specificities were determined. RESULTS: Among 558 investigated cases, the predominant genotype was P[8]G1 (42%), followed by P[8]G9 (15%), P[4]G8 (7%), P[6]G8 (6%), and P[8]G8 (4%), with 10% mixed strains. Overall, there were 6 different P types and 7 G types. No association was identified between genotype and child age, sex, or severity of diarrhea. The P and G genotypes and polyacrylamide gel electropherotypes showed significant temporal variation in frequency: P[8]G1 decreased from 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43%-58%) in 2002 to 30% (95% CI, 24%-37%) in 2004, and P[4]G8 increased from 2% (95% CI, 0%-5%) in 2002 to 13% (95% CI, 9%-19%). Quarterly data revealed seasonally endemic and emergence and/or decay patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of rotavirus strains causing severe diarrhea in rural Kenyan children showed a predominance of P[8]G1 and confirms the importance of G8 and G9 strains in sub-Saharan Africa. Considerable genetic diversity of rotavirus strains was observed, including substantial mixed and unusual types, coupled with significant temporal strain variation and emergence.

However, there is a scarcity of information on rotavirus disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted prospective, hospital-based surveillance for rotavirus diarrhea among children <5 years of age at the tertiary care Dr. George Mukhari Hospital (DGM) and at the Brits district Hospital (BH) in the Gauteng and North West Provinces in South Africa; we estimated that up to 80% of children <5 years of age in their catchment areas who are hospitalized for diarrhea are admitted to one of these hospitals. RESULTS: At DGM, 2553 children <5 years of age were admitted for diarrhea from January 2003 through December 2005, and 852 children <5 years of age were treated for diarrhea at BH during 2004-2005. We examined stool specimens from 450 children (53%) at BH and from 1870 children (73%) admitted to DGM. An estimated 22.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.2%-24.5%) of the children hospitalized with diarrhea at DGM were rotavirus positive, and the corresponding figure at BH was 18.2% (95% CI, 14.9%-22.1%). Among children <5 years of age admitted to DGM for any reason, an estimated 5.5% (95% CI, 5.1%-6.0%) had rotavirus diarrhea. Our incidence estimates suggest that 1 in 43-62 children in the area is likely to be hospitalized with rotavirus diarrhea by 2 years of age.

			"abstract": "The colonization process of the infant gut microbiome has been called chaotic, but this view could reflect insufficient documentation of the factors affecting the microbiome. We performed a 2.5-y case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome, to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of  approximately  500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present before the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis, and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome are associated with life events; however, additional experiments ought to be conducted to assess how different infants respond to similar life events.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been previously reported that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and particularly secretor status provides protection against symptomatic norovirus infection, but it remains unclear to what extent this includes asymptomatic infections in children. METHODS: To explore whether HBGAs or certain viral genotypes are associated with asymptomatic norovirus infections in a pediatric population in Nicaragua, we investigated 163 children </=5 years of age, without a recent history of diarrhea (</=10 days). RESULTS: Asymptomatic norovirus infections were observed in 11.7% (19/163), with children </=6 months of age being most frequently infected (16%). Of the 19 norovirus-positive children, 4 (21%) and 10 (53%) were infected with genogroups GI and GII, respectively, and 4 children (21%) were infected with viruses of both genogroups. Most children had >/=10 viral genomes per gram of feces. Nucleotide sequence analysis (15/19) revealed uncommon genotypes, such as, GII.7 (n = 5) and GII.2 (n = 3). An interesting observation was the low frequency of norovirus GII.4 strains among the asymptomatic children. AB blood type, Lewis a (Le) phenotype and nonsecretor genotype (sese) were not found among the asymptomatic children, but they occurred in population controls. CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of asymptomatic norovirus infections was similar to that observed in symptomatic children from Nicaragua. Norovirus GII.2 and GII.7 were frequently detected but the globally dominating GII.4 was infrequent. Host genetic factors previously observed to be associated with protection against symptomatic norovirus infection were not found in this study.",

NSP4-B type was the single predominant genotype during 2003-2006 in Shanghai. The titers of NSP4 specific IgG antibody increased with age after birth and peaked during 12-23 months of age, thereafter dropping to a level as low as that in the first 5 months of age. However, high levels of antibody against whole rotavirus were maintained in older children over 5 years of age and in adults. Information on prevalence of NSP4 genotypes in this area of China provides useful data for formulating vaccine policy. Short antibody immune memory compared with that induced mainly by rotavirus structural proteins indicated the protective effect against rotavirus may not persist long term if a single NSP4 protein is applied as the rotavirus vaccine.",

METHODS: MAS was induced in ventilated rabbits using 3.5 ml/kg of 20% human meconium. Tracheal suction with either catheter suction (CS) or meconium aspirator (MA) was performed after meconium instillation. Percentage of meconium collection rate, PaO(2) trends for 2h after tracheal suction, and acute-phase SpO(2) trends were compared between CS and the other three groups, the tube was withdrawn while meconium was aspirated with an MA, then the trachea was reintubated 5, 10 or 15s after suctioning of meconium. RESULTS: Percentage of meconium collection rate and PaO(2) showed no significant differences between groups. The MA group taking 15s for reintubation after meconium suctioning, showed a significantly lower acute-phase SpO(2) than the CS group (P<0.05). The time for SpO(2) to return to >or=90% was also longer in the MA group taking 15s for reintubation than in the CS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Intratracheal CS removed the same volume of meconium with less impact on desaturation compared with meconium aspiration in an animal model of MAS. Intratracheal CS may be benefit to remove meconium in non-vigorous infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid at birth.",

However, there are limited data on the role of NoVs in neonatal infections and disease. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of NoVs in neonates with gastrointestinal disease using a case-control study design and to characterize the NoV strains infecting neonates. A total of 309 fecal samples from 161 neonates with gastrointestinal symptoms and 148 asymptomatic controls were screened for genogroup II (GII) NoV using reverse transcription-PCR. A subset of PCR-positive amplicons for the polymerase and capsid regions was sequenced. NoV was detected in 26.2% of samples, with the rate of detection being significantly higher among symptomatic neonates (60/161, 37.2%) than asymptomatic neonates (24/148, 14.1%) (P < 0.001). On the basis of sequencing of 29 strains, a single NoV strain, GIIb, was identified to be the predominant (27/29, 93.1%) cause of neonatal infections. Coinfection with rotavirus was seen in nearly one-third of symptomatic neonates. The study demonstrates a high prevalence of NoV infections in neonates and indicates that coinfection with rotavirus may result in significantly more gastrointestinal disease in this population.",

			"article_name": "Identifying prenatal cannabis exposure and effects of concurrent tobacco exposure on neonatal growth.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug among pregnant women, but data describing the effects of prenatal cannabis exposure and concurrent nicotine and cannabis exposures on neonatal growth are inconsistent. Testing of meconium, the first neonatal feces, offers objective evidence of prenatal cannabis exposure, but the relative ability of meconium testing and maternal self-report to identify affected neonates remains unclear. METHODS: Eighty-six pregnant women provided detailed self-reports of daily cannabis and tobacco consumption throughout pregnancy. Cannabinoids and tobacco biomarkers were identified in oral fluid samples collected each trimester and quantified in meconium at birth. RESULTS: Cannabis-using women were significantly more likely to also consume tobacco, and smoked similar numbers of cigarettes as non-cannabis-using tobacco smokers. As pregnancy progressed, fewer women smoked cannabis and those who continued to use cannabis reported smoking a smaller number of cannabis joints, but positive maternal oral fluid tests cast doubt on the veracity of some maternal self-reports. More neonates were identified as cannabis exposed by maternal self-report than meconium analysis, because many women quit cannabis use after the first or second trimester; meconium was more likely to be positive if cannabis use continued into the third trimester. Cannabis exposure was associated with decreased birth weight, reduced length, and smaller head circumference, even after data were controlled for tobacco coexposure. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal cannabis exposure was associated with fetal growth reduction. Meconium testing primarily identifies prenatal cannabis exposure occurring in the third trimester of gestation.",

			"abstract": "AIM: Previously, glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition in very low birth weight infants (VLBW) decreased the incidence of atopic dermatitis at age 1 year. The aim of this study was to determine whether this effect is related to changes in intestinal bacterial species that are associated with allergy, such as bifidobacteria, clostridium histolyticum, clostridium lituseburense (Chis/lit group) and Escherichia coli at age 1 year. METHODS:   Eighty-nine infants were eligible for this follow-up study, conducted at a Tertiary care hospital. Bifidobacteria, Chis/lit group and E. coli were measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization in faecal samples collected at age 1 year. Information on allergic and infectious diseases was previously determined by questionnaire. RESULTS:  Seventy-two of 89 (81%) infants were participated. Prevalence of all studied species was not different between glutamine-supplemented and control groups. Allergic infants were less frequently colonized with bifidobacteria than nonallergic infants (p =0.04). Between neonatal period and 1 year, prevalence of bifidobacteria was increased (p < 0.001), of Chis/lit group was unchanged (p=0.84), and of E. coli was decreased (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION:  The beneficial effect of glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition on the incidence of atopic dermatitis in the first year of life in VLBW infants is not related to changes in bifidobacteria, Chis/lit group or E. coli. Allergic VLBW infants are less frequently colonized with bifidobacteria compared to nonallergic VLBW infants.",

ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) have been increasingly isolated from nosocomial infections in Antananarivo, Madagascar. METHODS: we conducted a prevalence survey in a pediatric unit from March to April 2008 Patient rectal swabs were sampled on the first and the last day of hospitalization. Medical staff and environment were also sampled. Rectal and environmental swabs were immediately plated onto Drigalski agar supplemented with 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxon. RESULTS: Fecal carriage was detected in 21.2% of 244 infants on admission and 57.1% of 154 on discharge, after more than 48 hours of hospitalization (p < 0.001). The species most frequently detected on admission were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (36.9%), whereas, on discharge, K. pneumoniae was the species most frequently detected (52.7%). ESBL-associated resistances were related to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (91.3%), gentamicin (76.1%), ciprofloxacin (50.0%), but not to amikacin and imipenem. The increased prevalence of carriage during hospitalization was related to standard antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSION: The significant emergence of multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens in Malagasy hospitals poses a serious health threat requiring the implementation of surveillance and control measures for nosocomial infections.",

			"abstract": "Alveolar epithelial cells of neonates are directly exposed to aspirated meconium during meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). This study was designed to investigate the influence of quantity and time of meconium exposure on the cell viability and caspase activity in type II human alveolar epithelial cells. Human alveolar epithelial cells were incubated with human meconium suspension at different concentrations and for different times. Cell viability and DNA fragmentation were investigated together with caspases activity and the amount of Bcl-2 protein present. We found that cell viability was significantly lower in cells exposed to a higher concentration of meconium. This was also true for cells exposed to meconium for longer. Significantly higher DNA fragmentation, an approximately two- to fivefold increase, was observed in cells that had been exposed to higher (5% and 10%) concentration of meconium compared to those treated with lower (0.1% and 1%) concentrations (P < 0.05). The activity of most apoptotic initiators (caspase 2, 8, 9, 10) and effectors (caspase 3, 6) were found to be significantly higher in cells subject to greater meconium exposure compared to cells with no or minor meconium exposure. The level of Bcl-2 was also found to be significantly decreased in meconium-exposed cells (P < 0.05). In conclusion, human meconium would seem to induce direct cell death as well as caspase-dependent apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells; the amount and period of exposure to meconium are crucial factors in this process. Thus, removing aspirated meconium should alleviate lung cell damage in neonates and improve the outcome with MAS.",

Very little is known about the occurrence and detection possibilities of therapeutic and licit drugs in meconium. Meconium specimens (n = 209) were collected in delivery hospitals, from infants of mothers who were suspected to be drug abusers. A targeted analysis method by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed for abused drugs: amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, morphine, codeine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, oxycodone, methadone, tramadol, buprenorphine, and norbuprenorphine. A separate LC-MS/MS method was developed for 11-nor-\u2206(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid. A screening method based on LC coupled to time-of-flight MS was applied to a broad spectrum of drugs. As a result, a total of 77 different compounds were found. The main drug findings in meconium were as follows: local anesthetics 82.5% (n = 172), nicotine or its metabolites 61.5% (n = 129), opioids 48.5% (n = 101), stimulants 21.0% (n = 44), hypnotics and sedatives 19.0% (n = 40), antidepressants 18.0% (n = 38), antipsychotics 5.5% (n = 11), and cannabis 3.0% (n = 5). By revealing drugs and metabolites beyond the ordinary scope, the present procedure helps the pediatrician in cases where maternal denial is strong but the infant seems to suffer from typical drug-withdrawal symptoms.

We describe a cluster of NEC in a level III NICU involving 15 infants over a6-month period. Cohorting and stringent infection control measures were associated with termination of the cluster. A case-control study was used to investigate potential risk factors associated with development of NEC. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 55 infants (10 of 15 NEC and 45 non-NEC controls). Enteric pathogens were identified by culture and/or molecular diagnostic techniques. For the case-control study, controls were selected from admitted neonates during the same time and in the preceding 6-month period, matched for gestation and birthweight. RESULTS: Forty percent (4/10) of NEC infants had norovirus RNA detected compared with 9% (4/45) of non-NEC infants (OR: 6.83, 95% CI: 1.3-34.9,P = 0.021). A lower rate of prolonged rupture of membranes and a higher rate of maternal smoking was also observed in NEC infants than in controls. No significant differences in incidences of chorioamnionitis, intrapartum antibiotics,volume of feedings, time of first formula feeding, and rates of patent ductus arteriosus or intrauterine growth retardation were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Infants who developed NEC had an increased incidence of norovirus detection in their stool following diagnosis.

Comparing epidemiologic and clinical features of norovirus to rotavirus ADE will aid in the decision-making process required to develop norovirus vaccines. METHODS: Surveillance for ADE occurring in children < or =5 years of age was implemented in the emergency department (ED) and ward of a large hospital in Santiago and Valparaiso, and in 4 outpatient clinics in Santiago. A stool sample was obtained within 48 hours of consultation for rotavirus detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and noroviruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. For ED and hospital rotavirus and norovirus ADE parents were instructed to monitor clinical findings associated with severity until the end of the episode. The 20-point Vesikari score was used to determine disease severity. RESULTS: Between July 2006 and October 2008 rotavirus and noroviruses were detected in 331 (26%) and 224 (18%) of 1913 ADE evaluated. The proportion of rotavirus-positive samples in hospital ward, ED, and outpatient clinic was 40%, 26% to 30%, and 13% compared with 18%, 17% to 19%, and 14% for noroviruses. Mean age and 25%-75% interquartile interval of children with rotavirus and norovirus ADE were remarkably similar, 15.6 months (9-20), and 15.5 months (9-19), respectively. Rotavirus cases displayed an autumn-winter peak followed 2 to 3 months later by the norovirus peak. The mean (interquartile) for the Vesikari score was 12.9 (11-15) and 11.9 (9-14.5) for rotavirus (N = 331) and norovirus (N = 224) ADE, respectively, P = 0.003. Compared with norovirus, rotavirus ADE were more common in the 11 to 16 severity score interval (P = 0.006), had a higher maximum stool output in a given day (P = 0.01) and more frequent fever (P < 0.0001). Duration of diarrhea, presence, duration and intensity of vomiting, and intensity of fever did not differ between viruses. Mixed rotavirus and norovirus infections were uncommon (<1%) and not clinically more severe. Clinical severity of ADE in young infants was similar for rotavirus and lower (P = 0.03) for noroviruses compared with older children. CONCLUSION: Noroviruses are a significant cause of moderate to severe endemic ADE in Chilean children. Although significantly less severe than rotavirus as a group, most norovirus episodes were moderate to severe clinically. An effective norovirus vaccine would be of significant additional benefit to the current rotavirus vaccine in decreasing disease burden associated with ADE.",

			"abstract": "A 4-year (2005-2008) norovirus (NoV) surveillance study was conducted in the state of Rio Janeiro, Brazil, to demonstrate the role of these viruses in outbreaks and sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis. A cohort of 1,687 fecal samples was obtained from patients with gastroenteritis; 324 were rotavirus-positive. Of the remainder 1,363 rotavirus-negative samples, 1,087 samples were tested for NoV RNA in this study. The study enrolled 267 outpatients from Municipal Public Health Centers and 820 inpatients, whose samples were obtained by active surveillance in Public Hospitals. Fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription (RT) followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the MON 431-434 set of degenerate primers for NoV GI and GII detection, and there were 35.1% (381/1,087) positive samples for NoV, consisting of 30.2% (248/820) and 49.8% (133/267) from inpatient and outpatient, respectively. Children infected by NoV had significantly more frequent mucus in feces, vomiting and fever. No seasonal pattern in NoV infections was observed in patients admitted to hospital; however, two peaks of NoV infections were observed from ambulatory cases, suggesting that there was an occurrence of outbreaks in those time periods. Molecular characterization revealed GII to be the most prevalent genogroup, totaling 96.3% (104/108) of all sequences analyzed, and GII.4 was the genotype detected most frequently (80.7%), followed by GII.6, 3, 14, 7, and 8. Two GI strains, GI.2 and GI.3, were also observed. The number of outbreaks and sporadic cases described in this study highlights the need to implement diagnosis of NoV in surveillance laboratories.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe factors associated with a rectal swab or stool sample positive for norovirus, rotavirus, or adenovirus. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Charleston Area Medical Center, a regional academic medical center in Charleston, West Virginia. METHODS: Rectal swab or stool samples were obtained from patients suspected of having viral gastroenteritis. These samples were sent to the Charleston Area Medical Center virology laboratory for testing in 2007. Viral antigen in rectal swab and stool samples is detected by use of commercially available immunoassay kits for each virus. Data were extracted from the virology laboratory database for the following 1-year time period: January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007. When necessary, additional information was obtained from electronic administrative data on patients. RESULTS: There were 2,867 rectal swab and stool samples available for viral testing. Of these samples, 1,261 (44%) were positive for a virus. Of these positive samples, 972 (77%) were positive for norovirus, 182 (14%) were positive for rotavirus, and 110 (9%) were positive for adenovirus. The patients in the youngest age group had the highest number of test results positive for all 3 viruses. When the test results for the youngest age group (0-9 years) were compared with those for all the other age groups combined (10-99 years), the proportion of positive cases was highest for the youngest age group (P<.001). There were significant seasonal trends for all 3 viruses. Multivariate analysis of norovirus showed that season, source, sex, and age were significant predictors of a positive test result. Multivariate analysis of rotavirus showed that season and source were significant predictors of a positive test result. Multivariate analysis of adenovirus showed that season and age were significant predictors of a positive test result. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude (1) that these 3 viruses are common causes of gastroenteritis in Charleston, West Virginia; (2) that infants and young children are more likely to test positive for these viruses than are older individuals; (3) that norovirus was the most common cause of gastroenteritis; and (4) that there are seasonal trends for all 3 viruses.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common causes of bacterial infection in human beings. Studies have showed a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori among people in low-income countries and colonization early in life. A monoclonal antigen test, performed on faeces, HpSA ImmunoCardSTAT, has a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and the faecal test can be performed in all ages, also in resource-limited settings. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with Helicobacter pylori colonization in apparently healthy children aged 0-12 years in urban Kampala, Uganda. METHOD: We tested 427 apparently healthy children, age 0-12 years (211 males, 216 females), in a cross sectional survey for Helicobacter pylori colonization using HpSA ImmunoCardSTAT. A short standardized interview with socio-demographic information and medical history was used to assess risk factors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in the 427 children was 44.3% (189 out of 427). Early colonization was common, 28.7%, in children younger than 1 year of age. The age specific rates were 46.0% in children age 1- < 3 years, 51.7% in children age 3- < 6 years, 54.8% in children age 6- < 9 years and 40.0% in children age 9- < 12 years. There was a significant difference in prevalence by gender; female 38.5% versus male 49.8% and by type of housing; permanent house 38.5% versus semi-permanent house 48.6%. Congestive living and education level of the female caretaker showed a clear trend for a difference in prevalence. Factors independently associated with Helicobacter pylori colonization included: drugs taken last three months, using a pit latrine, sources of drinking water and wealth index. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori colonization among urban Ugandan children is high at an early age and increases with age. The impact of Helicobacter pylori colonization on children's health in Uganda needs to be further clarified.",

Fecal calprotectin levels have been reported to be much higher in both healthy full-term and preterm infants than in children and adults. OBJECTIVE: To determine the time course of fecal calprotectin (f-calprotectin) excretion in preterm infants from birth until hospital discharge and to identify factors influencing f-calprotectin levels in the first weeks of life, including bacterial establishment in the gut. METHODOLOGY: F-calprotectin was determined using an ELISA assay in 147 samples obtained prospectively from 47 preterm infants (gestational age, and birth-weight interquartiles 27-29 weeks, and 880-1320 g, respectively) at birth, and at 2-week intervals until hospital discharge. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Although median f-calprotectin excretion was 138 microg/g, a wide range of inter- and intra-individual variation in f-calprotectin values (from day 3 to day 78) was observed (86% and 67%, respectively). In multivariate regression analysis, f-calprotectin correlated negatively with ante and per natal antibiotic treatment (p = 0.001), and correlated positively with the volume of enteral feeding (mL/kg/d) (p = 0.009), the need to interrupt enteral feeding (p = 0.001), and prominent gastrointestinal colonization by Clostridium sp (p = 0.019) and Staphylococcus sp (p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: During the first weeks of life, the high f-calprotectin values observed in preterm infants could be linked to the gut bacterial establishment.",

Our aim was to assess the impact of immunization on the incidence of severe rotavirus acute gastroenteritis (AGE). METHODS: We performed a 5-year (2004-2008) prospective surveillance at a sentinel hospital in Sao Paulo, with routine testing for rotavirus in all children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with AGE. Genotypes of positive samples were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: During the study, 655 children hospitalized with AGE were enrolled; of whom 169 (25.8%) were positive for rotavirus. In the postvaccine period, a 59% reduction in the number of hospitalizations of rotavirus AGE and a 42.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.6%-59.0%; P = 0.001) reduction in the proportion of rotavirus-positive results among children younger than 5 years were observed, with the greatest decline among infants (69.2%; 95% CI, 24.7%-87.4%; P = 0.004). Furthermore, the number of all-cause hospitalizations for AGE was reduced by 29% among children aged <5 years. The onset and peak incidences of rotavirus AGE occurred 3 months later in the 2007 and 2008 seasons compared with previous years. Genotype G2 accounted for 15%, 70%, and 100% of all cases identified, respectively, in 2006, 2007, and 2008. CONCLUSIONS: After vaccine implementation, a marked decline in rotavirus AGE hospitalizations was demonstrated among children younger than 5 years of age, with the greatest reduction in the age groups targeted for vaccination. The predominance of genotype G2P[4] highlights the need of continued postlicensure surveillance studies.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate and update evidence on the efficacy and safety of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis CNCM I-3446 supplementation in preterm infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Cochrane Library and MEDLINE databases and major pediatric conference proceedings were searched in December 2008 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The company that manufactures B lactis was contacted for unpublished data. The review was restricted to RCTs performed in preterm infants <37 weeks of gestation and/or with a birth weight <2500 g. RESULTS: Four RCTs involving 324 infants met the inclusion criteria. Compared with controls, B lactis supplementation has the potential to increase fecal bifidobacteria counts and to reduce Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium spp counts. It also can reduce stool pH and fecal calprotectin concentrations, increase fecal immunoglobulin A and short-chain fatty acid concentrations, and decrease intestinal permeability. Compared with controls, B lactis supplementation had no effect on the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis stage > or = 2 (3 RCTs, n = 293, risk ratio [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.16-1.83), risk of sepsis (2 RCTs, 397 cultures, RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.07-5.2), and use of antibiotics (2 RCTs, n = 255, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.28-1.62). The power of these studies, however, does not allow for a definitive statement regarding a reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. B lactis supplementation did have some effects on anthropometric parameters. No adverse events associated with B lactis supplementation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence regarding the potential beneficial effects of B lactis supplementation in preterm infants is encouraging. Further studies to assess clinically relevant outcomes are needed.",

			"abstract": "Between April 1999 and March 2008, a total of 4,976 stool specimens collected from patients with suspected viral infection through infectious agent surveillance in Aichi, Japan, were tested for the presence of human parechoviruses (HPeVs). We detected HPeVs in 110 samples by either cell culture, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), or both. Serotyping either by neutralization test or by nucleotide sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region and 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) regions revealed that 63 were HPeV type 1 (HPeV-1), followed by 44 HPeV-3 strains, 2 HPeV-4 strains, and 1 HPeV-6 strain. The high nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the Japanese HPeV-3 isolates in 2006 to the strains previously reported from Canada and Netherlands confirmed the worldwide prevalence of HPeV-3 infection. Ninety-seven percent of the HPeV-positive patients were younger than 3 years, and 86.2% younger than 12 months. The clinical diagnoses of HPeV-positive patients were gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, febrile illness, exanthema, \"hand, foot, and mouth disease,\" aseptic meningitis, and herpangina. Among 49 HPeV-positive patients with gastroenteritis, 35 were positive with HPeV-1 and 12 with HPeV-3, and out of 25 with respiratory illness, 11 were positive with HPeV-1 and 14 with HPeV-3. HPeV-3 seemed to be an important etiological agent of respiratory infection of children. While HPeV-1 was detected predominantly during fall and winter, the majority of the HPeV-3 cases were detected during summer and fall. A different pattern of clinical manifestations as well as seasonality suggested that there are different mechanisms of pathogenesis between HPeV-1 and HPeV-3 infections.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether the RV-A genotypes and cold seasonal pattern described in patients with diarrhea is reflected by sewage surveillance, which could be representative of the RV-A genotypes circulating in the population. The genotype distribution of RV-A in effluent samples from a local sewage treatment plant was compared to those from local clinical cases. A total of 52 sewage samples and 70 stool specimens from children with acute non-bacterial diarrhea were collected from January to December 2006. The effluent specimens were concentrated and RNA extracts from concentrated sewage and clinical samples were genotyped for the rotavirus VP7 gene. The proportional distribution of the RV-A G-genotypes in sewage and clinical samples during the cold season was similar: G1 accounted for 26.6% of the typed sewage isolates and 28.8% of the clinical infections; G3 type accounted for 21.9% and 25.8%; G2 type 15.6% and 10.6%; G4 type 17.2% and 21.2%; G8 type 1.6% and 0%; and the G9 type 17.2% and 13.6%, respectively. A similar picture of RV-A genotype detection was obtained in sewage samples collected during the cold and warm seasons. The results indicate that there is a correlation between genotypes of RV-A isolates from human diarrheic patients and of those from sewage samples. In addition, sewage monitoring highlighted the uniform all-year RV-A circulation, which was in contrast to the peak incidence of RV-A infection in the community.",

			"article_name": "Molecular epidemiology of cross-species Giardia duodenalis transmission in western Uganda.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Giardia duodenalis is prevalent in tropical settings where diverse opportunities exist for transmission between people and animals. We conducted a cross-sectional study of G. duodenalis in people, livestock, and wild primates near Kibale National Park, Uganda, where human-livestock-wildlife interaction is high due to habitat disturbance. Our goal was to infer the cross-species transmission potential of G. duodenalis using molecular methods and to investigate clinical consequences of infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Real-time PCR on DNA extracted from fecal samples revealed a combined prevalence of G. duodenalis in people from three villages of 44/108 (40.7%), with prevalence reaching 67.5% in one village. Prevalence rates in livestock and primates were 12.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Age was associated with G. duodenalis infection in people (higher prevalence in individuals <or=15 years) and livestock (higher prevalence in subadult versus adult animals), but other potential risk factors in people (gender, contact with domestic animals, working in fields, working in forests, source of drinking water, and medication use) were not. G. duodenalis infection was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in people, nor was clinical disease noted in livestock or primates. Sequence analysis of four G. duodenalis genes identified assemblage AII in humans, assemblage BIV in humans and endangered red colobus monkeys, and assemblage E in livestock and red colobus, representing the first documentation of assemblage E in a non-human primate. In addition, genetic relationships within the BIV assemblage revealed sub-clades of identical G. duodenalis sequences from humans and red colobus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our finding of G. duodenalis in people and primates (assemblage BIV) and livestock and primates (assemblage E) underscores that cross-species transmission of multiple G. duodenalis assemblages may occur in locations such as western Uganda where people, livestock, and primates overlap in their use of habitat. Our data also demonstrate a high but locally variable prevalence of G. duodenalis in people from western Uganda, but little evidence of associated clinical disease. Reverse zoonotic G. duodenalis transmission may be particularly frequent in tropical settings where anthropogenic habitat disturbance forces people and livestock to interact at high rates with wildlife, and this could have negative consequences for wildlife conservation.",

The purpose of this study was to determine patterns and risk factors of helminth infections and anemia in a rural and a peri-urban community of Zanzibar, Tanzania, in the context of national helminth control programs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We carried out a community-based cross-sectional study in 454 individuals by examining at least two stool samples with different methods for soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Trichuris trichiura) and one urine sample for Schistosoma haematobium. Finger-prick blood was taken to estimate anemia levels and to detect antibody reactions against ascariasis, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach. Parasitological methods determined a helminth prevalence of 73.7% in the rural, and 48.9% in the peri-urban setting. Most helminth infections were of light intensity with school-aged children showing the highest intensities. Multiple helminth species infections were pervasive in rural dwellers regardless of age. More than half of the participants were anemic, with a particularly high prevalence in the peri-urban setting (64.7%). Risk factors for helminth infections were age, sex, consumption of raw vegetables or salad, recent travel history, and socio-economic status. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: After several years of chemotherapy-based morbidity control efforts in Zanzibar, helminth prevalences are still high and anemia is common, but helminth infection intensities are low. Hence, chemotherapy should be continued, and complemented with improved access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and health education, along with poverty alleviation measures for a more enduring impact.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To improve diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) by noninvasive markers representing gut wall integrity loss (I-FABP and claudin-3) and gut wall inflammation (calprotectin). Furthermore, the usefulness of I-FABP to predict NEC severity and to screen for NEC was evaluated. METHODS: Urinary I-FABP and claudin-3 concentrations and fecal calprotectin concentrations were measured in 35 consecutive neonates suspected of NEC at the moment of NEC suspicion. To investigate I-FABP as screening tool for NEC, daily urinary levels were determined in 6 neonates who developed NEC out of 226 neonates included before clinical suspicion of NEC. RESULTS: Of 35 neonates suspected of NEC, 14 developed NEC. Median I-FABP, claudin-3, and calprotectin levels were significantly higher in neonates with NEC than in neonates with other diagnoses. Cutoff values for I-FABP (2.20 pg/nmol creatinine), claudin-3 (800.8 INT), and calprotectin (286.2 microg/g feces) showed clinically relevant positive likelihood ratios (LRs) of 9.30, 3.74, 12.29, and negative LRs of 0.08, 0.36, 0.15, respectively. At suspicion of NEC, median urinary I-FABP levels of neonates with intestinal necrosis necessitating surgery or causing death were significantly higher than urinary I-FABP levels in conservatively treated neonates. Of the 226 neonates included before clinical suspicion of NEC, 6 developed NEC. In 4 of these 6 neonates I-FABP levels were not above the cutoff level to diagnose NEC before clinical suspicion. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary I-FABP levels are not suitable as screening tool for NEC before clinical suspicion. However, urinary I-FABP and claudin-3 and fecal calprotectin are promising diagnostic markers for NEC. Furthermore, urinary I-FABP might also be used to predict disease severity.",

This will be accomplished by assessing the rate of voluntary participation in a nonanonymous neonatal screening program and by determining the logistics of implementing the necessary follow-up and interventions as part of routine care. Additionally, this study will determine the predictive value of fatty acid ethyl ester-positive meconium with regard to neurodevelopmental delays. This is an ongoing prospective cohort study. Written informed consent is sought from all Grey Bruce women delivering at participating birthing sites. Collected meconium samples are tested for fatty acid ethyl esters by headspace-solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Children with positive results are followed up through an existing public health program involving regular home visits and assessments of developmental milestones by a public health nurse. These children and matched control subjects also undergo neurodevelopmental testing at 3 and 18 months of age by a clinical psychologist using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. If delays are detected, the child is referred to diagnostic services and appropriate intervention programs. This study has been granted ethics approval and enrollment began in November 2008 at St. Joseph's Health Care in London, Ontario. The first positive case has been identified and the follow-up is currently being conducted by the public health unit. The successful completing of this study will reveal the population's willingness to participate in a neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure and determine the costs, feasibility, and utility of implementing such programs in clinical practice.",

			"abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide range of deficits known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Epidemiologic studies regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy have concentrated on North America, but recent reports have suggested that consumption is significant in many parts of the world. In Uruguay, alcohol consumption has changed into more risky and dangerous patterns and thus has a theoretical risk of having a high rate of prenatal alcohol exposure. This study characterizes the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure in Montevideo, Uruguay, using a novel biomarker, fatty acid ethyl esters, in meconium as well as a survey to mothers. Nine hundred five meconium samples were collected from Hospital Pereira Rossell and Hospital de Clinicas in Montevideo, Uruguay. A maternal questionnaire was also completed. Meconium was analyzed for fatty acid ethyl esters using liquid-liquid and solid phase extraction with gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Meconium was also analyzed for other drugs of abuse using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Forty-four percent of meconium samples were above the positive cutoff for fatty acid ethyl esters and represent those newborns with risky prenatal exposure during the final two trimesters of pregnancy. Infants with prenatal alcohol exposure were more likely to have prenatal exposure to tobacco (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.20) or any illicit drug (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-5.31). Ethyl linoleate was a significant predictor of infant birth weight along with prenatal tobacco exposure, maternal body mass index, and infant sex. This study highlights a 44% incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure.",

			"article_name": "Nicotine and metabolites in meconium as evidence of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and predictors of neonatal growth deficits.",
			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many women continue tobacco use during pregnancy despite known adverse consequences on neonatal growth and development. Testing meconium, the first neonatal feces, for tobacco biomarkers offers objective evidence of prenatal tobacco exposure. However, relationships between the amount, frequency, and timing of cigarette smoking during gestation and tobacco biomarker meconium concentrations and neonatal outcomes are unclear. METHODS: Eighty-seven pregnant women provided detailed self-reports of daily tobacco consumption throughout pregnancy. Nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine were quantified in neonatal meconium by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Among nonsmokers, all meconium specimens were negative, whereas nearly all meconium specimens were positive if the mother self-reported tobacco use into the third trimester. Tobacco biomarker concentrations were significantly albeit weakly correlated with mean cigarettes per day in the third trimester. Reduced birth weight, gestational age, or head circumference were observed if meconium contained one or more tobacco biomarkers, but deficits did not correlate with biomarker concentrations. CONCLUSION: While previously thought to reflect second and third trimester drug exposure, meconium appears to reliably identify only third trimester drug use. While a 10 ng/g nicotine, cotinine, or trans-3'-hydroxycotinine cutoff in meconium was previously proposed to differentiate tobacco-exposed from nonexposed or passively exposed neonates, improved maternal self-reporting techniques in this cohort suggest that a lower cutoff, equivalent to the analytic limits of quantification, is more appropriate.",

			"abstract": "Identification of maternal opioid abuse in pregnancy is often difficult to ascertain in the absence of a reliable self-report. We aimed to characterize an at-risk neonatal population for opioid exposures as well as other drugs of abuse and alcohol. From June 2007 to January 2009, 563 neonatal hair and 1318 meconium specimens were assessed for opioids and were positive in 11.4% and 17.0%, respectively. Neonates testing positive for opioids in hair or meconium analysis were also more likely to test positive for other licit and illicit substances (odds ratiohair, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.97; odds ratiomeconium, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.22). Specifically, a positive neonatal hair test for opioids also predicted a positive result for oxycodone. In addition, a positive meconium test result for opioids was associated with positive results for cocaine, oxycodone, methadone, benzodiazepines, and fatty acid ethyl esters (alcohol). Finally, there was a significant correlation between maternal and neonatal hair test results for opioids (Spearman rank rho = 0.657, P = 0.03). Understanding the addiction profiles of these women may lead to better clinical and social management and may largely benefit an at-risk population.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The neonatal abstinence scoring system proposed by Finnegan is used widely in neonatal units to initiate and to guide therapy in babies of opiate-dependent mothers. The purpose of this study was to assess the variability of the scores in newborns and infants not exposed to opiates during the first 3 days of life and during 3 consecutive days in weeks 5 or 6. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Healthy neonates born after 34 completed weeks of gestation, whose parents denied opiate consumption and gave informed consent, were included in this observational study. Infants with signs or symptoms of disease or with feeding problems were excluded. A modified scoring system was used every 8 hours during 72 hours by trained nurses; 102 neonates were observed for the first 3 days of life and 26 neonates in weeks 5-6. A meconium sample and a urine sample at weeks 5-6 were stored from all infants to be analysed for drugs when the baby scored high. Given a non-Gaussian distribution the scores were represented as percentiles. RESULTS: During the first 3 days of life median scores remained stable at 2 but the variability increased, with the 95th percentile rising from 5.5 on day 1 to 7 on day 2. At weeks 5-6 median values were higher during daytime (50th percentile = 5, 95th percentile = 8) than night-time (50th percentile = 2, 95th percentile = 6, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Scores increase from days 1-3 to weeks 5-6 and show day-night cycles with 5-6 weeks. Values above 8 can be considered pathological. This data may help to raise suspicion of narcotic withdrawal and to guide therapy.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Refugee children have complex medical needs and often have multiple infections. The relationship between infection, gastrointestinal symptoms, and systemic inflammation is poorly understood. We investigated these parameters in refugee children with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, helminth, and malaria infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: African refugee children were recruited at resettlement health screening. Data were collected on demography, gastrointestinal symptoms, co-morbid infection, and serum for peripheral cytokine levels. Helicobacter pylori infection was diagnosed by a fecal-based immunoassay. RESULTS: Data from 163 children were analyzed, of which 84.0% were positive for H. pylori. Infected children were significantly older (9.2 years +/- 3.7 vs 7.1 years +/- 3.9, p = .01). Half the cohort (84/163, 51.5%) described gastrointestinal symptoms but these were not strongly associated with co-morbid infections. Helicobacter pylori-infected children had significantly lower circulating log-interleukin-8 (IL-8) (odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40, 0.94, p = .025). Helminth infections were common (75/163, 46%) and associated with elevated log-IL-5 (beta: 0.42, 95% CI 0.077, 0.76). Children with malaria (15/163, 9.2%) had elevated log-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and log-IL-10 (beta: 0.67, 95% CI 0.34, 1.0 and beta: 1.3, 95% CI 0.67, 1.9, respectively). IL-10 : IL-12 ratios were increased in H. pylori-infected children with malaria or helminth infections. Symptoms were generally not associated with levels of circulating peripheral cytokines irrespective of co-morbid infection diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of asymptomatic H. pylori infection in recently resettled African refugee children. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not predictive of H. pylori nor of helminth infections. Serum cytokines, particularly IL-5, IL-10, and TNFalpha, were significantly elevated in children with malaria and helminth infections but not in those with H. pylori infection.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mucosal immunity induced by oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is imperfect and potentially allows immunized individuals to participate in asymptomatic wild-type poliovirus transmission in settings with efficient fecal-oral transmission of infection. METHODS: We examined the extent of asymptomatic wild-type poliovirus transmission in India by measuring the prevalence of virus in stool samples obtained from 14,005 healthy children who were in contact with 2761 individuals with suspected poliomyelitis reported during the period 2003-2008. RESULTS: Wild-type poliovirus serotypes 1 and 3 were isolated from the stool samples of 103 (0.74%) and 104 (0.74%) healthy contacts, respectively. Among contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed poliomyelitis, 27 (12.7%) of 213 and 29 (13.9%) of 209 had serotypes 1 and 3, respectively, isolated from their stool samples. The odds ratio of excreting serotype 1 wild-type poliovirus was 0.13 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.87) among healthy children reporting 6 doses of OPV, compared with children reporting 0-2 doses. However, two-thirds of healthy children who excreted this virus reported >or=6 doses, and the prevalence of this virus did not decrease with age over the sampled range. CONCLUSIONS: Although OPV is protective against infection with poliovirus, the majority of healthy contacts who excreted wild-type poliovirus were well vaccinated. This is consistent with a potential role for OPV-vaccinated children in continued wild-type poliovirus transmission and requires further study.",

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly associated with respiratory tract disease but have been implicated in enteric disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of coronaviruses in stool samples from children and adults with gastrointestinal illness by RT-PCR. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical samples submitted for infectious diarrhea testing were collected from December 2007 through March 2008. RNA extraction and RT-PCR was performed for stools negative for Clostridium difficile using primer sets against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. Clinical data from samples positive for coronaviruses were reviewed and recorded. RESULTS: Samples from 479 patients were collected including 151 pediatric (< or = 18 years), and 328 adults (>18 years). Of these samples, 4 patients (1.3%, 2 adult; 2 pediatric) screened positive for the presence of a coronavirus. All detected coronaviruses were identified as HCoV-HKU1. No stools screened positive for either HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-OC43. All HCoV-HKU1 positive samples occurred between mid-January to mid-February. Clinical manifestations from HCoV-HKU1 positive patients included diarrhea, emesis and respiratory complaints. Three (75%) patients were admitted to the hospital with a median length of stay of 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Coronaviruses as a group are not commonly identified in stool samples of patients presenting with gastrointestinal illness. HCoV-HKU1 can be identified in stool samples from children and adults with gastrointestinal disease, with most individuals having respiratory findings as well. No stool samples screened positive for HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, or HCoV-OC43.",

This study introduces for the first time the hyphenation of CE with an electrospray mass spectrometer, capable to perform multiple MS analysis (ESI-MS(n)) for the separation and characterization of HMOs in breast milk and feces of breast-fed babies. LIF was used for on- and off-line detections. From the overall 47 peaks detected in off-line CE-LIF electropherograms, 21 peaks could be unambiguously and 11 peaks could be tentatively assigned. The detailed structural characterization of a novel lacto-N-neo-tetraose isomer and a novel lacto-N-fucopentaose isomer was established in baby feces and pointed to gastrointestinal hydrolysis of higher-Mw HMOs. CE-LIF-ESI-MS(n) presents, therefore, a useful tool which contributes to an advanced understanding on the fate of individual HMOs during their gastrointestinal passage.",

			"abstract": "The detection of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) in meconium has been investigated recently as an alternative to meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) measurement as an objective estimate of prenatal alcohol exposure, independent of maternal self-reporting. We report the results of the first study conducted to investigate the concentrations of EtG and EtS in meconium from newborns with and without intrauterine exposure to ethanol, defined by questionnaire and meconium FAEEs concentration. FAEEs, EtG, and EtS were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in meconium samples obtained from the Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova, Reggio Emilia, Italy (n = 80) and from the Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, Spain (n = 105). Median EtG and EtS values in meconium from newborns without intrauterine exposure to ethanol varied between 0.100 and 0.140 nmol/g and 0.010 and 0.020 nmol/g in Reggio Emilia and Barcelona samples, respectively. In meconium from newborns with uncertain prenatal ethanol exposure, the EtG median value was 0.160 nmol/g in the Italian cohort and 0.250 nmol/g in the Spanish one. The median EtS concentration was 0.020 in both cohorts. EtG and EtS median values in 5 meconium samples from newborns of heavily drinking mothers were 7.240 nmol/g and 0.033 nmol/g, respectively. A positive cutoff of 2.0 nmol/g for EtG yielded the best sensitivity and specificity (100%) to discriminate for true prenatal exposure to ethanol. It was not possible to establish a proper cutoff for EtS because of the low number of positive samples. Based on our results, meconium EtG can be proposed as an alternate biomarker for intrauterine alcohol exposure. In contrast to the 7 FAEEs, EtG is just one molecule that could be screened in meconium samples from all newborns by a simple, low-cost, easy-to-perform immunoassay, which can be routinely applied in neonatology wards for the early diagnosis of prenatal exposure to ethanol.",

We carried out a cross-sectional epidemiological survey in two villages in Niger: Falmado is endemic for Schistosoma haematobium only, whereas a mixed S. haematobium-S. mansoni focus has been reported from Diambala. The survey examined 282 children (149 girls, 133 boys, average age: 2.6 years) and 224 mothers (average age: 30.1 years). For S. haematobium diagnosis, two urine samples obtained on consecutive days were subjected to the standard urine filtration method. Additionally, macro- and microhaematuria were determined. The diagnosis of S. mansoni was based on a single stool sample with duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears. In Diambala, a standardised, pre-tested questionnaire was administered to mothers, which recorded demographic data, treatment history with anthelminthic drugs, household sanitation and water supply, and bathing practices for their children. Prevalence of egg-patent S. haematobium infections among young children and their mothers was respectively 50.5% and 55.6%, in Falmado, and 60.5% and 72.2% in Diambala. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection in Diambala was 43.8% among children and 52.1% in mothers. Mixed egg-patent infections of S. haematobium and S. mansoni were revealed in 28.6% of the children and 37.3% of the mothers. Questionnaire data showed that 69.8% of the children were accompanied by their mothers to schistosomiasis transmission sites before they were 1 year of age, and that three-quarter of the mothers used water directly drawn from the irrigation canals to wash their children. To conclude, a substantive proportion of children below the age of 5 years had egg-patent schistosomiasis, inclusive of co-infection with S. haematobium and S. mansoni.

Moreover, coronavirus-like particles have been seen by electron microscope in stools, and SARS-HCoV has been isolated from intestinal tissue and detected in stool samples. OBJECTIVES: To find out if HCoVs can be found in stools of children with acute gastroenteritis and to assess the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in children. STUDY DESIGN: 878 stool specimens from children with acute gastroenteritis and 112 from control children were tested by RT-PCR to detect HCoV groups 1B, 2A and SARS. HCoVs were typed by sequencing all PCR positive samples. RESULTS: Twenty-two (2.5%) of the 878 stool specimens of children with acute gastroenteritis were positive for HCoVs. The following HCoV types were detected: OC43 (10 cases, 45.5%), HKU1 (6 cases, 27.3%), 229E (2 cases, 9.1%) and NL63 (4 cases, 18.2%). In 4 of the cases a HCoV was the only detected virus; in the remaining cases rotavirus or norovirus was found in the same sample. In control groups there were two HCoV positive samples of 112 tested. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that all known non-SARS HCoVs can be found in stools of children with acute gastroenteritis. On the basis of this study, the significance of coronaviruses as gastrointestinal pathogens in children appears minor, since most of the coronavirus findings were co-infections with known gastroenteritis viruses.",

A total of 3,130 stools collected between 2005 and 2008 were tested by immune enzyme tests. G-P genotype identification of rotavirus strains were performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rotavirus etiology was confirmed in 32.4% of the samples tested. Rotaviruses affected predominantly children under 5 years of age (95.5%), with a peak prevalence between the ages of 7 and 36 months. Four of the five globally distributed rotavirus strains (G1P[8], G2P[4], G4P[8], and G9P[8]) constituted 97.7% of all rotavirus strains in circulation. However, annual shifts of predominant rotavirus G-P genotypes were observed from season to season-G4P[8] was predominant in rotavirus season 2004/2005 (56.8%), but was replaced by G9P[8] in 2005/2006 (77.7%), and G2P[4] (41.6%) and G1P[8] (39.5%) in the following two consecutive rotavirus seasons. Year-round circulation of rotaviruses in the country with increased incidence in the winter-spring season and unexpected peaks preceding the rotavirus seasons were observed.

			"article_name": "New meconium biomarkers of prenatal methamphetamine exposure increase identification of affected neonates.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prenatal methamphetamine (MAMP) exposure is poorly reflected in neonatal meconium. Often, maternal self-reported MAMP use is not corroborated by positive results in amphetamines immunoassays of meconium, and even if initial test results are positive, they frequently are not confirmed for MAMP or amphetamine (AMP) by chromatographic analysis. The presence of the MAMP metabolites p-hydroxymethamphetamine (pOHMAMP), p-hydroxyamphetamine (pOHAMP), and norephedrine (NOREPH) in meconium may improve the identification of MAMP- and AMP-exposed neonates. METHODS: Immunoassay-positive and -negative meconium samples were subjected to liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometric reanalysis for these recently identified metabolites. RESULTS: pOHAMP and NOREPH were detected only when MAMP and/or AMP were present and thus do not appear to be promising biomarkers of prenatal MAMP exposure. pOHMAMP, in contrast, identified 6 additional neonates whose mothers reported MAMP exposure, yet had a meconium sample screened as negative; pOHMAMP was more likely to be present if maternal MAMP use continued into the third trimester. Although the pOHMAMP results for meconium samples corroborated the maternal self-reports, the confirmation rate for positive meconium screening results did not improve with the inclusion of these new biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: pOHMAMP identified additional MAMP- exposed neonates; therefore, MAMP, AMP, and pOHMAMP should be included in meconium chromatographic analyses. Maximizing the identification of MAMP-exposed children requires improvement in immunoassay screening tests to reduce false-negative and false-positive results. Additional research will help clarify which AMP-related compounds, if any, contribute to unconfirmed positive results in screening tests. Furthermore, nonamphetamine compounds endogenous to the complex meconium matrix also may cross-react, making chromatographic confirmation of screening results essential.",

Prospective, cross-sectional surveillance for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) was conducted in hospitals and outpatient paediatric clinics in Taiwan to assess the prevalence of rotavirus gastroenteritis and associated medical costs prior to rotavirus vaccine introduction. Faecal specimens were collected from 1130 children <5 years of age from December 2004 to June 2006. The year-round rate of rotavirus detection in faecal specimens was 46% for children seen in hospitals and 14% for children seen in paediatric clinics. In the winter season, the burden was higher, reaching a peak of 60% and 21% in hospitals and paediatric clinics, respectively. The rotavirus genotype distributions were 39% (G1), 34% (G9), 12% (G2), 15% (G3), and 0.3% (G5). Total medical and nonmedical costs were US $754 for a rotavirus hospitalisation and US $60 for an outpatient clinic visit. Parental work loss averaged 4.0 days per hospital visit and 1.3 days per paediatric clinic visit.

One hundred twenty-three of the samples (84.2%) were confirmed to be positive for group A rotavirus (community-acquired, n = 90 [73.2%] and nosocomial, n = 33 [26.8%]), and were typed subsequently using RT-PCR and sequence analysis methods. Determination of G- and P-type combinations showed that G4P[6] (78.9%) was the most common strain, followed by G3P[8] (7.3%), G1P[8] (6.5%), G2P[4] (0.8%), G2P[6] (0.8%), G1P[6] (0.8%), and G9P[8] (0.8%) strains. Of the 97 G4P[6] strains, 62 (63.8%) were responsible for community-acquired cases and 35 (36.1%) were hospital-acquired cases. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene from the G4P[6] strains revealed that both the community-acquired and nosocomial strains were segregated to the human rotaviruses circulating world-wide, including the prototype vaccinal strain, ST3, which constituted a novel sublineage in lineage 1. Owing to the recent emergence of G4P[6] rotaviruses within the hospital, as well as in the community, the findings from this study are important since they provide new information concerning the community and nosocomial spread of rotaviruses.",

The smoking markers, nicotine and its metabolites cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (OH-cotinine), were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The self-reported smoking status during pregnancy determined by means of a questionnaire was verified by measurement of maternal urine. In all smokers, nicotine metabolites were detected in amniotic fluid and in 80% of them nicotine as well. However, the sum of the nicotine metabolites (Sum(met)) was significantly lower (p < .001) in amniotic fluid (704 +/- 464 nmol/L) than in meconium (921 +/- 588 nmol/L), neonatal urine (1139 +/- 813 nmol/L) and maternal urine (4496 +/- 3535 nmol/L). Concentrations of nicotine metabolites in amniotic fluid correlated well (p < .001) with that in the other specimen types. After environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure, no nicotine or nicotine metabolites were detectable in amniotic fluid but only in maternal and neonatal urine. Analysis of amniotic fluid at birth lends itself to verifying smoking habits during pregnancy and clearly discriminating from ETS exposure, but it is not a suitable approach to differentiating between ETS exposure and non-exposure.",

			"article_name": "Mode of delivery affects the bacterial community in the newborn gut.",
			"abstract": "The first colonisation of the intestine is one of the most profound immunological exposures faced by the newborn and it is influenced by external and internal factors. The early composition of human microbiota could have long-lasting metabolic effects and the initial composition of human intestinal bacteria is also known to affect postnatal immune system development, as we are already aware that reduced microbial stimulation during infancy would result in slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between TH1 and TH2-like immunity. Mode of delivery has a major role on the composition of intestinal microbiota in early infancy, as it has been shown that infants born by Caesarean section (CS) have lower numbers of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides compared with vaginally born infants. We designed a study to investigate the influence of mode of delivery (CS vs. vaginal delivery) on intestinal microbial composition on day 3 of life using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and PCR-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). Both DGGE and TGGE analyses have been used, together with the specific amplifications for 10 Bifidobacterium sp., 3 Ruminococcus sp., and Bacteroides that all have a highly relevant physiological role in the intestinal ecosystem of the newborn. A total of 46 term infants were enrolled in the study, consecutively recruiting all the CS-delivered babies (n=23; 8 males and 15 females) and the immediately following spontaneously delivered babies (n=23; 11 males and 12 females). DGGE analysis carried out with Bifidobacterium-specific primers revealed the presence of this genus in 13 of 23 (56.5%) samples derived from vaginally delivered newborns but in none of the samples obtained from newborns delivered by CS. PCR analysis with Bifidobacterium-species-specific primers showed that naturally delivered infants had a large number of bifidobacterial species, whereas in CS-delivered babies only two samples (8.7%) gave positive results, one for B. longum and another for B. gallicum. In all babies enrolled, micro-organisms belonging to Ruminococcus species were absent and Bacteroides was found in 8.7% of spontaneously delivered babies only. Based on our findings, it seems that newborn's intestinal bacteria during the first 3days of life are strongly influenced by mode of delivery. The intestinal flora of CS and vaginally delivered infants appears to be very different; the former being altered and characterised by a substantial absence of Bifidobacteria sp., the latter characterised by subject-specific microbial profiles, although predominant groups such as B. longum and B. catenulatum could be identified. In summary, mode of delivery does affect the early stage of intestinal bacterial colonisation, which is altered in CS-delivered infants compared with vaginally delivered infants, with only a minor influence of the type of feeding. In addition, the importance of methodological aspects for determining intestinal microbiota in clinical trials requires emphasis if intestinal microbiota composition is to be considered a measure of postnatal adaptation.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perturbations in the gut microbiota have been linked to atopic diseases. However, the development of atopic diseases depends not only on environmental factors (like microbial stimulation) but also on genetic factors. It is likely that particularly gene-environmental interactions in early life determine the development of atopy. OBJECTIVE: We examine the interaction between detection of fecal Escherichia coli and genetic variations in the CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) genes in relation to atopic manifestations. METHODS: Within the Child, Parent and Health: Lifestyle and Genetic Constitution (KOALA) Birth Cohort Study, fecal samples of 957 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for E coli. Fourteen haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the genes TLR4 and CD14 were genotyped in 681 of the 957 children. Atopic outcomes were parentally reported eczema in the first 2 years of life and clinically diagnosed eczema and allergic sensitization at age 2 years. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate a multiplicative model of interaction. RESULTS: Most of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed no significant interaction with E coli exposure for both eczema and allergic sensitization. A borderline significant multiplicative interaction was found between E coli and the rs2569190 (CD14/-159) SNP regarding allergic sensitization. Furthermore, a statistically significant multiplicative interaction was found for the TLR4 SNP rs10759932 (P for interaction = .001). E coli colonization was associated with a decreased risk of sensitization only in children with the rs10759932 TT genotype (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.68) and not in children with the minor C allele. This interaction remained statistically significant after controlling for multiple testing. CONCLUSION: The current study is the first to address the potential effect-modifying role of genetic variations in the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and allergy development.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Meconium, the first intestinal discharge of the newborn, contains material accumulated during fetal life. Meconium activates complement and CD14 and may induce a systemic inflammatory response. Toll-like receptors are classical pattern-recognition receptors recognizing both exogenous and host-derived ligands. The cyanobacterial product CyP is a potent LPS antagonist binding to the TLR4/MD-2 complex. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the CD14/TLR4/MD-2 complex in meconium-induced inflammation. METHODS: Whole blood from six donors was preincubated with anti-CD14 or CyP. Meconium was added and the samples were incubated for 4h. Twenty-seven inflammatory mediators were measured in a Bioplex Array Reader. Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with plasmids containing NF-kappaB dependent luciferase reporter, human MD-2, TLR4, TLR2 and/or CD14, were incubated with meconium or LPS for 18 h. Luciferase activity in cytoplasmic extracts was measured using a Luciferase Assay System kit. RESULTS: Meconium induced formation of a broad panel of inflammatory mediators. CyP and anti-CD14 significantly (p<0.001) inhibited meconium-induced formation of (a) proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma) by 60-80% and 72-94%, respectively, (b) anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-1Ra) by 58-59% and 50-65%, respectively, (c) chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, eotaxin, IP-10) by 43-77% and 57-87%, respectively, and (d) growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, basic FGF, PDGFbb) by 53-71% and 40-78%, respectively, with no statistical significant difference between Cyp and anti-CD14. The inflammatory response could only partly be explained by LPS, suggesting that endogenous components of meconium contribute to the inflammatory response. Meconium activated NF-kappaB dose-dependently in cells expressing TLR4/MD-2 together with CD14, while no effect was seen in cells expressing TLR4/MD-2 alone or in TLR2/CD14 transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the CD14-dependent meconium-induced inflammatory reaction is mediated through the TLR4/MD2 complex.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amnioinfusion is thought to dilute meconium present in the amniotic fluid and so reduce the risk of meconium aspiration. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of amnioinfusion for meconium-stained liquor on perinatal outcome. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (May 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion for women in labour with moderate or thick meconium-staining of the amniotic fluid. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data, independently. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies of variable quality (4143 women) are included.Subgroup analysis was performed for studies from settings with limited facilities to monitor the baby's condition during labour and intervene effectively, and settings with standard peripartum surveillance.Settings with standard peripartum surveillance: there was considerable heterogeneity for several outcomes. There was no significant reduction in the primary outcomes meconium aspiration syndrome, perinatal death or severe morbidity, and maternal death or severe morbidity. There was a reduction in caesarean sections (CSs) for fetal distress but not overall. Meconium below the vocal cords diagnosed by laryngoscopy was reduced, as was neonatal ventilation or neonatal intensive care unit admission, but there was no significant reduction in perinatal deaths or other morbidity. Planned sensitivity analysis excluding trials with greater risk of bias resulted in an absence of benefits for any of the outcomes studied.Settings with limited peripartum surveillance: two studies (855 women) were included. In the amnioinfusion group there was a reduction in CS for fetal distress and overall; meconium aspiration syndrome (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.47), and neonatal ventilation or neonatal intensive care unit admission; and a trend towards reduced perinatal mortality (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.01). In one of the studies, meconium below the vocal cords was reduced and, in the other, neonatal encephalopathy was reduced. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Amnioinfusion is associated with substantive improvements in perinatal outcome only in settings where facilities for perinatal surveillance are limited. It is not clear whether the benefits are due to dilution of meconium or relief of oligohydramnios.In settings with standard peripartum surveillance, some non-substantive outcomes were improved in the initial analysis, but sensitivity analysis excluding trials with greater risk of bias eliminated these differences. Amnioinfusion is either ineffective in this setting, or its effects are masked by other strategies to optimise neonatal outcome.The trials reviewed are too small to address the possibility of rare but serious maternal adverse effects of amnioinfusion.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since hepatitis A virus (HAV) is acquired primarily through the fecal-oral pathway, several investigators have used HAV seropositivity as a proxy for exposure to this pathway. This paper is a critical review of the evidence relevant to the association between seropositivity to HAV and Helicobacter pylori, and considers the validity of comparisons for testing the hypothesis that H. pylori spreads by the fecal-oral route. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Medline search identified reports of all types published in the English language literature that were linked to the keywords 'Campylobacter pylori', 'hepatitis A', or 'Helicobacter pylori', cross-referenced with 'seroepidemiology', 'seroprevalence', or 'seropositivity'. Studies identified by the search were included in the review if they used specific IgG antibodies to classify the serostatus of subjects for both HAV and H. pylori infection and provided an estimate of the magnitude of the association between HAV and H. pylori or information that permitted calculation of an odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: Out of the 21 studies identified, 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies showed ORs for an association of HAV and H. pylori that ranged from 0.81 to 8.4. After adjustment for potential confounders, ORs shifted toward the null. They also showed that HAV seroprevalence is lower than H. pylori seroprevalence in early life and then becomes higher in later life. Thus in most populations, the trends cross over at some point. CONCLUSION: The observed associations between the two infections are generally overestimated by the confounding effects of age and socio-economic status-related factors, and when these factors are controlled, the association becomes weak. Moreover, HAV infection elicits a long-term antibody response, while H. pylori infection does not. Consequently, serostatus comparison does not constitute a convincing test of the fecal-oral transmission hypothesis for H. pylori.",

FAEEs, EtG and EtS were measured in meconium samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A head space-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to test HEtG and HFAEEs in hair samples from mothers and their newborns. Eighty-two meconium samples (82.8%) tested positive for EtG, 19 (19.2%) for EtS while 22 (22.2%) showed FAEEs levels higher than 2 nmol/g, the cut-off used to differentiate daily maternal ethanol consumption during pregnancy from occasional or no use. Although EtG and EtS in meconium did not correlate with total FAEEs concentration, a good correlation between EtG, EtS and ethyl stearate was observed. Moreover, EtG correlated well with ethyl palmitoleate, while EtS with ethyl laurate, myristate and linolenate. Neither maternal nor neonatal hair appears as good predictors of gestational ethanol consumption and subsequent fetal exposure in these mother-infant dyads. In conclusion, these data show that meconium is so far the best matrix in evaluating intrauterine exposure to ethanol, with EtG and EtS being potentially good alternative biomarkers to FAEEs.",

			"abstract": "Buprenorphine is under investigation in the U.S. as pharmacotherapy for opioid-dependent pregnant women. Buprenorphine and metabolites were quantified in umbilical cord specimens from women receiving daily buprenorphine doses. Correlations between maternal buprenorphine dose, buprenorphine and metabolite umbilical cord concentrations, and neonatal outcomes were investigated, as well as the ability to identify heroin and cocaine relapse during pregnancy. Umbilical cord concentrations were compared to those of matched umbilical cord plasma and meconium. Buprenorphine metabolites were detected in all cords, but buprenorphine itself was absent. Concentration ranges were 1.2-5.1 ng/g norbuprenorphine, 1.7-4.2 ng/g buprenorphine-glucuronide, and 8.3-23 ng/g norbuprenorphine-glucuronide. Cord concentrations were similar to those in plasma, and lower (16-210-fold), although statistically correlated, than those in meconium. Significant positive correlations were observed for buprenorphine-glucuronide concentrations in umbilical cord and mean maternal BUP daily dose throughout pregnancy and third trimester, but buprenorphine biomarker concentrations did not predict neonatal outcomes. Opiate concentrations were lower (200-fold) in umbilical cord than in meconium, and when cocaine was present in meconium, it was not identified in cord. Umbilical cord can serve as an alternative matrix for identifying prenatal drug-exposure, but is much less sensitive than meconium. Buprenorphine provided a controlled drug administration model for evaluating drug disposition in the maternal-fetal dyad.",

			"abstract": "Many ethanol dependent women also use other drugs of abuse that may affect pregnancy outcome and long-term child neurodevelopment. This study investigated the association between drugs of abuse and concurrent use of ethanol in pregnancy. A study cohort of neonates with FAEE levels above 2 nmol per gram meconium, indicative of heavy in utero ethanol exposure, was identified (n=114). Meconium and hair analyses for the presence of other drugs of abuse were obtained for some of these neonates and the rates of drug exposure were compared with the rates in a cohort of neonates who were tested negative (FAEE below 2 nmol per gram meconium) for ethanol exposure (n=622). Odds ratios (ORs) for various drugs were calculated with ethanol exposure. A 15.5% positive rate for intrauterine ethanol exposure was detected. A high rate of in utero drug exposure was detected in neonates with and without in utero ethanol exposure, 60.5% versus 62.7% respectively. Neonates with heavy in utero ethanol exposure were almost twice as likely to be exposed to narcotic opiates (OR=1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.20) and 3.3 times as likely to be exposed to amphetamine (OR=3.30; 95% CI 1.06-10.27) when compared to neonates with no ethanol exposure. Exposure to cannabinoids predicted less likely exposure to ethanol (OR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) and no significant difference was noted in the exposure to cocaine (OR=1.24, 95% CI: 0.81-1.91). Neonates suspected of heavy in utero ethanol exposure should be tested for other drugs of abuse and vice versa. Early detection of drug exposures can facilitate early intervention to both the neonate and the mother, thus decreasing the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for the child, including secondary disabilities associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.",

In this study, fecal specimens collected from 147 infants and young children admitted to hospital with acute gastroenteritis in 2005 in Chiang Mai, Thailand, were screened for NoVs and SaVs by reverse transcription-multiplex polymerase chain reaction (RT-multiplex PCR). Ten isolates (6.8%) belonged to NoV GII genogroup and five (3.4%) were positive for SaVs. GII/4 was the most predominant genotype of NoVs, followed by GII/15, GII/6, and GII/12. Surprisingly, NoVs GII/1, GII/2, GII/3, GII/7, and GII/16 genotypes, which were detected previously during the 2002-2004 survey, were not detected in 2005. Conversely, NoVs GII/6, GII/12, and GII/15 appeared in 2005 but were not detected during the 2002-2004 survey. The only genotype found to be common, as the most predominant genotype, in both surveys was NoV GII/4. Similar findings were also observed for SaVs, that is, the GI/2 and GIV detected during 2002-2004 were not detected in 2005, while GI/5 and GII/3 detected in 2005 were not detected previously during the 2002-2004 surveillance. In addition, comprehensive genetic evolutionary analysis of NoV GII/4 genotype demonstrated that the majority of GII/4 detected in this study (CMH002/05, CMH005/05, CMH042/05, and CMH083/05) were classified as new NoV variants and fell into subtype GII/4-d (Hunter'04-like cluster).

METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted between 2004 and 2006 among 447 individuals of the Kaingang ethnic group, in the municipality of Candido de Abreu, Southern Brazil. The enteroparasite control measures were: sanitation improvements in 2003, antiparasite treatments that were administered during the study period, and health education activities that were started in 2005. Parasitological health indicators were obtained through three coproparasitological surveys (in 2004, 2005 and 2006), in which 250, 147 and 126 stool samples, respectively, were collected. These were evaluated using the spontaneous sedimentation, centrifugation-flotation and Kato-Katz methods. Housing and hygiene conditions were assessed by means of a questionnaire applied to 69 (2004), 57 (2005) and 38 (2006) of the 90 families. RESULTS: The overall prevalences of enteroparasites were 91.6% (2004), 94.6% (2005) and 87.3% (2006) and did not show any significant reduction. The prevalence of some species decreased, while the prevalence of others increased significantly. High-intensity infections due to geohelminths presented rates of less than 2% over the study period. The proportion of the interviewees who reported using a toilet increased from 38.8% to 71.1% (p< 0.005) and the proportion taking antiparasite agents increased from 70.2% to 100% (p= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There were significant improvements in the parasitological health indicators, such as reductions in the prevalence of some species of enteroparasites and maintenance of a low parasite load, thus showing the importance of combining antiparasite treatment with sanitation improvements.",

We sought to identify those factors in children. METHODS: In this unmatched case-control design, children of both sexes, aged 0 to 15 years having positive stool culture for Shigella from 1997 to 2006 were studied. Children with Shigella encephalopathy constituted the cases (n = 29), whereas randomly selected children with shigellosis having no encephalopathy constituted controls (n = 87). RESULTS: The case-fatality was significantly higher among the cases than among controls (7% vs. 0%, RR: 4.2, CI: 3.0-5.9, P = 0.013). In logistic regression analysis, children with Shigella encephalopathy more often had an illiterate father (OR: 5.4, 95% CI: 1.1-27.1, P = 0.038), stopped breast-feeding in the neonatal period (OR: 41.3, 95% CI: 4.2-403.1, P = 0.001), had dehydrating diarrhea (OR: 9.9, 95% CI: 2.1-45.9, P = 0.004) with a duration of <1 day (OR: 29.4, 95% CI: 2.1-43.2, P = 0.004), and were more likely to be severely stunted (OR: 6.4, 95% CI: 1.2-34.9, P = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Education of parents about the value of exclusive breast-feeding and of prompt hydration in children with Shigella is critical to minimize morbidity and deaths.",

Furthermore, 106 abdominal radiographs of CF patients with or without constipation were independently assessed by three observers on two separate occasions using the Barr and Leech scores. RESULTS: The prevalence of constipation was 47%. Low total fat absorption and meconium ileus were independent risk factors for constipation in CF, while fiber and fluid intake were not associated. In CF patients the inter and intraobserver variabilities of the Barr and Leech scores were poor to moderate. CONCLUSION: Constipation is a significant medical issue in CF and was associated with low total fat absorption and a history of meconium ileus. Finally, abdominal radiography seems of little value in the regular follow-up of CF patients.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Noroviruses (NoVs) are a major etiological agent of sporadic acute gastroenteritis worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To detect, quantify and characterize genogroups and genotypes of NoVs in children with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: NoVs were investigated by RT-PCR in a total of 319 fecal specimens from children up to three years old with (n=229) and without (n=90) acute diarrhea, between February 2003 and June 2004 in the emergency room in Vitoria, Southeastern Brazil. NoVs were quantified by real-time PCR and genotyped. RESULTS: NoVs were detected in 17% (40/229) and 13% (12/90) of symptomatic and asymptomatic children, respectively. Six NoV-rotavirus A mixed infections were observed. Fifty-one strains were characterized as NoV GII and one as GI. Twenty strains were characterized as GII/4 (9/13), GII/3 (1/13), GII/6 (2/13) and GII/14 (1/13) in symptomatic and GII/3 (6/7) and GII/8 (1/7) in asymptomatic children. The median RNA viral loads were 8.39 and 7.15log(10)copies/g of fecal specimens for symptomatic and asymptomatic children, respectively (p=0.011). NoV load was lower when it was present in a mixed infection with rotavirus A (p=0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a diversity of NoV strains circulating in this geographic area, and reports GII/8 and GII/14 in the American Continent for the first time. In addition, it confirms GII/4 as the most prevalent genotype in symptomatic children and identified GII/3 in an important frequency, especially in asymptomatic children. Furthermore, preliminary results show that symptomatic patients present a viral load that is significantly greater than asymptomatic children (p=0.011).",

			"abstract": "The role of meconium in the respiratory system was studied in newborns, who died from various causes (250 up to 3000 g of weight). We monitored tracheal rings response to dopamine, serotonin and ethanol in different concentrations (dopamine: 0,05 mg/ml, 0,5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml; serotonin (5-HT): 10-4, 10-3, 10-2, 10-1 mol/dm3; ethanol: 0,02 ml, 0,5 ml, 1,0 ml; 96%). Tracheal smooth musculature tonus (TSM) was examined in 48 tracheal preparations taken after the newborn exitus due to different reasons. Based on functional researche of isolated preparations of tracheas, it may be concluded that: aspiration of meconium has not changed the response of TSM to dopamine, serotonin and ethanol (p>0,1) in comparison with the control group, which have died due to different lung inflammatory processes (e.g. pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, atelectasis, cerebral hemorrhage). The results suggest that meconium does not potentiate the constricting action of dopamine, serotonin and ethanol in tracheobronchial system. Meconium causes mild relaxation of the TSM through a mechanism that is not intermediated by the products of cyclooxygenases (prostaglandins, prostacyclins) from the tracheal epithelium or proteins. Also, as it seems, the direct activity of many tested acids in the smooth musculature has no significant impact on increase of the airways tonus in MAS syndrome.",

METHODS: One-hundred-and-fifteen intestinal E. coli strains were analyzed: 30 strains from 10 antibiotic-naive infants; 27 from 9 antibiotic-treated outpatient infants; 30 from 9 healthy elderly volunteers; and 28 from 9 hospitalized elderly patients. The MIC values of ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole were measured by E-test and IntI1 was detected by PCR. RESULTS: Out of the 115 strains, 56 (49%) carried class 1 integron genes. Comparing persons without medical interventions, we found in antibiotic-naive children a significantly higher frequency of integron-bearing strains and MIC values than in healthy elderly persons (53% versus 17%; p < 0.01). Evaluating medical interventions, we found a higher resistance and frequency of integrons in strains from hospitalized elderly persons compared with non-hospitalized ones. Children treated with antibiotics had strains with higher MIC values (when compared with antibiotic-naive ones), but the integron-bearing in strains was similar. In most cases, the differences in resistance between the groups (integron-positive and negative strains separately) were higher than the differences between integron-positive and negative strains within the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of integrons in commensal E. coli strains in persons without previous medical intervention depended on age. The resistance of integron-carrying and non-carrying strains is more dependent on influencing factors (hospitalization and antibiotic administration) in particular groups than merely the presence or absence of integrons.",

In this study, a total of 434 fecal samples collected from 434 children with acute gastroenteritis in Seoul, between September 2007 and July 2008 were tested to determine the molecular epidemiology of NoVs and characterize recombinant strains by using RT-PCR followed by sequencing. Of the 434 specimens, NoV, rotavirus, and adenovirus were detected in 155 (35.8%), 72 (16.6%), and 19 specimens (4.3%), respectively. NoV GI was detected in 7 specimens (1.6%) and GII in 148 (34.1%) specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of capsid sequences in the GII-positive specimens revealed the presence of the following strains: GII-4, 111 (75.0%); GII-3, 35 cases (23.6%); GII-6b, 1 case; and GII-16, 1 case. Most of the GII-4 strains were grouped with the GII-4/2006b variant with 98-100% nucleotide identity. Eleven strains were identified as recombinant (GII-4/GII-3 in 10 cases and GII-b polymerase/GII-16 capsid in 1 case) by sequencing based on the RdRP and capsid genes. The putative recombination point in the recombinant strains was the ORF-1/ORF2 overlap, located at nucleotide 5,046 with reference to Lordsdale. In conclusion, GII-4/2006b variants were detected predominantly and a new recombinant strain (GII-4/GII-3) was found in the Korean children with gastroenteritis. Continuous monitoring of the genetic diversity of NoVs is important to determine the trend of the predominant genotype and new recombinant strain.",

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study of pregnant women from three communities in Zimbabwe. METHODS: Information collected by questionnaire at inclusion and from delivery records. Vaginal and rectal swabs collected for GBS culture at 20 and 26 weeks gestation, at delivery and from the newborn infant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GBS colonization in pregnancy, colonization of mother and newborn, and perinatal factors. RESULTS: GBS culture results were obtained at one or more occasion for 780 (75.2%) of 1,037 women recruited. Altogether, 470/780 women (60.3%) tested positive for GBS, with colonization rates at 20, 26 weeks and delivery of 47%, 24.2% and 21%, respectively. Positive GBS culture at 20 and 26 weeks gestation had a low positive predictive value on colonization at delivery and in the newborn. Women living in rural areas were significantly more often colonized than those who lived in urban areas (p < 0.001). Other socio-economic, demographic and obstetric factors were not statistically associated with GBS colonization. GBS transmission was not statistically significantly associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: GBS colonization was common among pregnant women in Zimbabwe. Dwelling in a rural area was significantly associated with GBS colonization while other risk factors were not. Early GBS colonization had a low predictive value for colonization at delivery and colonization was not associated with adverse perinatal outcome.",

Taiwan is an island with high fish consumption, and many pregnant women would like to enjoy the benefits of fish without jeopardizing their health or that of their child. The aim of this study is to assess the mercury concentration in meconium in relation to the health risk of mercury exposure. A total of 198 mother-infant pairs residing in the city of HsinChu were recruited for the study between January 2007 and June 2007. The average mean concentration of mercury in meconium was 79.2+/-7.3 ng g(-1) dry wt We use the Monte Carlo technique to assess the uncertainty in risk assessment and the impact of these uncertainties on the estimation of expected risk of mercury intake from fish in mothers. Based on the FAO/WHO's tolerable daily intake of methylmercury (0.23 microg kg(-1)d(-1)), we found that 17.3% and 14.0% of the daily mercury exposure estimated exceeded the reference dose for foreign-born and Taiwan-born mothers, respectively. We found that the mercury concentration in meconium was much higher than in other studies, except for one study done in Tagum in the Philippines where mercury is used in gold mining. This may be because Asia is the largest emitter of anthropogenic mercury, accounting for 53% of worldwide emissions. Sensitivity analysis suggests that mercury concentration in fish and the rate of ingesting fish may be the key parameters for governments offering risk management guidance to protect the health of mothers and unborn babies.",

RESULTS: While aggregate rotavirus hospitalization rates for the 3 sites were similar in 2006 and 2007 (22.5/10,000 and 26.8/10,000, respectively), individual rates for the 3 counties differed considerably. The rotavirus hospitalization rate in Rochester between 2006 and 2007 increased 3-fold, but decreased by 33% in Cincinnati and 41% in Nashville over the 2 study years. G1 strains accounted for >80% of strains at all 3 sites in 2006. However, in 2007, the uncommon P[8], G12 strain was detected in 69% of Rochester specimens, while the P[8], G1 strain remained predominant in the other 2 sites. No subjects received rotavirus vaccine in 2006 and coverage with 2 to 3 vaccine doses reached 15% in all 3 communities by June 2007. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2006 and 2007 rotavirus seasons, with only limited vaccine use, remarkable variability was observed in the population-based rates of severe rotavirus and in the rotavirus serotypes across the 3 sites. This natural secular variability in rotavirus disease must be considered in the assessment of the impact of vaccine on disease rates and rotavirus serotypes.",

Information on the epidemiology of E. coli intestinal pathogens and their association with diarrheal disease is limited because no diagnostic testing is available in countries with limited resources. To evaluate the prevalence of E. coli intestinal pathogens in a Caribbean-Colombian region, E. coli clinical isolates from children with diarrhea were analyzed by a recently reported two-reaction multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Gomez-Duarte et al., Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis 2009;63:1-9). The phylogenetic group from all E. coli isolates was also typed by a single-reaction multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We found that among 139 E. coli strains analyzed, 20 (14.4%) corresponded to E. coli diarrheagenic pathotypes. Enterotoxigenic, shiga-toxin-producing, enteroaggregative, diffuse adherent, and enteropathogenic E. coli pathotypes were detected, and most of them belonged to the phylogenetic groups A and B1, known to be associated with intestinal pathogens.

METHODS: The Cochrane Library was searched for interventions related to care before delivery with useful evidence on the outcomes 'meconium-stained amniotic fluid' and 'meconium aspiration syndrome'. FINDINGS: Curtailment of post-term pregnancy reduces the occurrence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and meconium aspiration syndrome. Uterine stimulants, particularly misoprostol, are associated with occurrence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Amniotomy during labour may be a risk factor for meconium aspiration syndrome. There is little research evidence on the benefits or otherwise of obstetric interventions such as expedited delivery for meconium-stained liquor without other evidence of fetal distress. Amnioinfusion for meconium-stained amniotic fluid improves neonatal outcome only in settings with limited peripartum surveillance. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of amnioinfusion for meconium-stained liquor in settings with adequate peripartum surveillance.",

			"abstract": "The pathogenetic cascade of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) in newborn infants is complex and still incompletely studied. The variable clinical presentation of MAS is basically connected with variation of the amount and consistency of aspirated meconium and also its distribution within the affected lungs. The contributing role of other factors, like intrauterine fetal compromises, lung maturity at the time of insult as well as direct and indirect effects of meconium and its components on the lung alveolar and vascular integrity and development, remains to be studied in further detail. Better understanding of the lung injury processes in MAS, specifically inflammatory injury and non-inflammatory apoptosis and their interplay, may offer new possibilities to treat the severely affected infants, and needs therefore to be explored. Systemic dispersion of intrapulmonary meconium and its components may further induce inflammatory circulatory changes and injurious effects in distant organs, but the mechanisms and clinical significance of these systemic complications are still poorly known. It is thus evident that lung injury processes and potent long-term consequences in various extrapulmonary organs, specifically the brain, as well as development of new approaches to their treatment and prevention form great challenges for future research of MAS.",

We hypothesized that this contrast is a consequence of the inefficiencies of current protocols for archaeon DNA extraction. We developed a new protocol for the extraction and PCR-based detection of M. smithii and M. stadtmanae DNA in human stool. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stool specimens collected from 700 individuals were filtered, mechanically lysed twice, and incubated overnight with proteinase K prior to DNA extraction using a commercial DNA extraction kit. Total DNA was used as a template for quantitative real-time PCR targeting M. smithii and M. stadtmanae 16S rRNA and rpoB genes. Amplification of 16S rRNA and rpoB yielded positive detection of M. smithii in 95.7% and M. stadtmanae in 29.4% of specimens. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene PCR products from 30 randomly selected specimens (15 for M. smithii and 15 for M. stadtmanae) yielded a sequence similarity of 99-100% using the reference M. smithii ATCC 35061 and M. stadtmanae DSM 3091 sequences.

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Among sensitized infants, those with high, as compared with low levels, of salivary secretory IgA (SIgA) are less likely to develop allergic symptoms. Also, early colonization with certain gut microbiota, e.g. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium species, might be associated with less allergy development. Although animal and in vitro studies emphasize the role of the commensal gut microbiota in the development of the immune system, the influence of the gut microbiota on immune development in infants is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether early colonization with certain gut microbiota species associates with mucosal and systemic immune responses i.e. salivary SIgA and the spontaneous Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 mRNA expression and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine/chemokine responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 64 Swedish infants, followed prospectively up to 5 years of age. Bacterial DNA was analysed with real-time PCR using primers binding to Clostridium difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and Bacteroides fragilis. Saliva was collected at age 6 and 12 months and at 2 and 5 years and SIgA was measured with ELISA. The PBMCs, collected 12 months after birth, were analysed for TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression with real-time PCR. Further, the PBMCs were stimulated with LPS, and cytokine/chemokine responses were measured with Luminex. RESULTS: The number of Bifidobacterium species in the early fecal samples correlated significantly with the total levels of salivary SIgA at 6 months. Early colonization with Bifidobacterium species, lactobacilli groups or C. difficile did not influence TLR2 and TLR4 expression in PBMCs. However, PBMCs from infants colonized early with high amounts of Bacteroides fragilis expressed lower levels of TLR4 mRNA spontaneously. Furthermore, LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, e.g. IL-6 and CCL4 (MIP-1 beta), was inversely correlated to the relative amounts of Bacteroides fragilis in the early fecal samples. CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterial diversity may enhance the maturation of the mucosal SIgA system and early intense colonization with Bacteroides fragilis might down-regulate LPS responsiveness in infancy.",

G9 rotaviruses have recently emerged all over the world and are thought to give more severe symptoms because of a lack of previous exposure and the absence of maternal antibodies in patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical severity of G9 infections compared to G1 infections in hospitalized children. STUDY DESIGN: The prospective study was conducted from 2004 to 2007 in French children under 5 years old hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. The rotaviruses were detected in stools by ELISA tests and genotyped by RT-PCR on the basis of their outer capsid proteins. The duration of hospitalization, the Vesikari clinical score, and the requirement for intravenous rehydration were compared. RESULTS: The stools from 370 children were analyzed and 162 stools infected by G1 (n=76) or G9 (n=86) rotaviruses were analyzed. Age and gender distribution were similar in the two groups as was the mean duration of hospitalization (2.7 days).

Here we present a description of infant gut ecological dynamics using a combination of nonlinear data modeling and simulations of the early infant gut colonization processes. Principal component analysis of infant microbiota 16S rRNA gene microarray data showed that the main directions of variation were defined by three phylum-specific probes targeting Bacteroides, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Nonlinear regression analysis identified several dynamic interactions between these three phyla. Simulations of the early phylum-level colonization process showed the relatively rapid establishment of an equilibrium community after an unstable initial phase. In general, varying the initial composition of phyla in the simulations had little bearing on the final equilibrium. The dynamic interaction model was found to maintain its predictive ability for Proteobacteria and Firmicutes well into the simulation, whereas Bacteroides densities tended to be underestimated, possibly due to host top-down selection for Bacteroides. In accordance with our model, initial perturbation of the microbiota by different mode of delivery (vaginal and C-section) did not affect the later phylum composition in the infants investigated. Considering the predictive ability and convergence of our phylum-level model, we now propose that deterministic bacterial-bacterial interactions are more important for shaping the human infant gut microbiota than previously anticipated.",

			"abstract": "Strong statistical associations between soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomes are frequently observed in co-endemic human populations, although the underlying explanations remain poorly understood. This study investigates the contribution of host genetics and domestic environment to hookworm and Schistosoma mansoni infection intensity and evaluates the role of genetic and non-genetic factors in co-variation of infection intensity. Detailed genealogical information allowed assignment of 1303 individuals living in the Brazilian community of Americaninhas, Minas Gerais state, to 25 pedigrees (containing between two and 1159 members) residing in 303 households. The prevalence of co-infection with both hookworms and schistosomes was high (38.5%), with significant correlation between Necator americanus and S. mansoni faecal egg counts. Bivariate variance component analysis demonstrated a modest but significant species-specific heritability for intensity of N. americanus (h(2)=0.196) and S. mansoni infection (h(2)=0.230). However, after accounting for demographic, socio-economic and household risk factors, no evidence for common genetic control of intensity of hookworm and schistosome infection was observed. There was some evidence for residual clustering within households but the majority (63%) of the covariance between N. americanus and S. mansoni infection intensity remained specific to the individual and could not be explained by shared genes, shared environment or other shared demographic, socio-economic or environmental risk factors. Our results emphasize the importance of exposure to hookworm and schistosome infection in driving the association between levels of infection with these species in hosts resident in areas of high transmission and suggest that much of this common exposure occurs outside the home.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The etiology of Hirschsprung's disease associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is unknown. Previous investigations have suggested that several factors such as dilation of proximal bowel, changes in colonic mucosal defence, and overgrowth of toxigenic bacteria may be related with it. This study was to quantify bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the feces of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) patients with or without enterocolitis and those of normal children. METHODS: Fresh stool specimens were collected at the first three days of the admission from 30 HD patients (aged 2 weeks to 2 years) and 15 healthy age-matched non-HD patients in the morning once a day for at least three days. All of them have not been given probiotics or antibiotics at least 7 days before stool collection. Hematoxylin-eosin and acetylcholinesterase histochemical staining on rectal biopsies of patients with HD confirmed the diagnosis of HD in all 30 patients. The 30 HD patients were divided into two groups based on the clinical history of enterocolitis: the HAEC group (n=10) and HD group (n=20). Fecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were consecutively quantified by SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR assay. Data were analyzed using SAS v. 12.6 for Windows. All tests were two-tailed, and P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean levels of bifidobacteria were 7.35+/-0.59, 8.16+/-1.17, and 8.35+/-0.74 in the HAEC, HD and control groups, respectively. The bifidobacteria colonization levels were lower in the HAEC group than in the HD and control groups (P<0.05, P<0.001 respectively). The mean level of lactobacilli in the HAEC (5.51+/-0.65) and HD groups (5.87+/-0.78) was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.39+/-0.56) (P<0.05). But there was no difference in log numbers of lactobacilli between HAEC and HD groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in HAEC patients may result in a decrease in epithelial barrier function and be a predisposing factor in the development of HAEC. This decline suggests that treatment with probiotics or prebiotics may be beneficial in these individuals. Further research will focus on whether probiotics can decrease the incidence of HAEC.",

METHODS: Stool samples from the first weeks of life were analysed in 48 VLBW infants. Bacterial cultures were performed and f-calprotectin concentrations were measured. In three NEC cases, cultures were performed on stool samples obtained before diagnosis. RESULTS: Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were often identified in the first stool sample, 55% and 71% of cases, respectively within the first week of life. A positive correlation between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and volume of enteral feed was found. Other bacteria often identified were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and Staphyloccus sp. F-calprotectin was not associated with any bacterial species. All NEC cases had an early colonization of LAB. Prior to onset of disease, all cases had a high colonization of non-E. coli Gram-negative species. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the previous studies in VLBW infants, we found an early colonization with LAB. We speculate that this may be due to early feeding of non-pasteurized breast milk.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Daily faecal samples from preterm infants were collected prospectively during an 8-month period from a level 3 regional neonatal intensive care unit. Six infants subsequently developed NEC and were matched with 7 non-NEC infants. Solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to extract and identify the VOCs from the headspace above the faecal samples taken before the onset of NEC and after the disease was diagnosed. Faecal samples at similar ages were also studied from the control infants. RESULTS: : Two hundred twenty-four different VOCs were extracted from 65 samples. Volatile organic compounds increased in number with age for non-NEC infants. In the days before and after the diagnosis of NEC a reduction in the number of VOCs extracted was observed. In addition, 4 specific esters present in controls-2-ethylhexyl acetic ester, decanoic acid ethyl ester, dodecanoic acid ethyl ester, and hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester-were consistently absent from all faecal samples in those infants who developed NEC in the 4 days before the onset of the disease. CONCLUSION: : This pilot study shows that VOC extraction from faeces may be used to identify infants that are at risk of developing NEC.",

			"abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disease due to mutations in the CFTR gene. Yet, variability in CF disease presentation is presumed to be affected by modifier genes, such as those recently demonstrated for the pulmonary aspect. Here, we conduct a modifier gene study for meconium ileus (MI), an intestinal obstruction that occurs in 16-20% of CF newborns, providing linkage and association results from large family and case-control samples. Linkage analysis of modifier traits is different than linkage analysis of primary traits on which a sample was ascertained. Here, we articulate a source of confounding unique to modifier gene studies and provide an example of how one might overcome the confounding in the context of linkage studies. Our linkage analysis provided evidence of a MI locus on chromosome 12p13.3, which was segregating in up to 80% of MI families with at least one affected offspring (HLOD = 2.9). Fine mapping of the 12p13.3 region in a large case-control sample of pancreatic insufficient Canadian CF patients with and without MI pointed to the involvement of ADIPOR2 in MI (p = 0.002). This marker was substantially out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the cases only, and provided evidence of a cohort effect. The association with rs9300298 in the ADIPOR2 gene at the 12p13.3 locus was replicated in an independent sample of CF families. A protective locus, using the phenotype of no-MI, mapped to 4q13.3 (HLOD = 3.19), with substantial heterogeneity. A candidate gene in the region, SLC4A4, provided preliminary evidence of association (p = 0.002), warranting further follow-up studies. Our linkage approach was used to direct our fine-mapping studies, which uncovered two potential modifier genes worthy of follow-up.",

The putative diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) were investigated for susceptibility to various antibiotics. Overall, 61 E. coli isolates were classified as enteroaggregative E. coli (29 isolates), atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (22 isolates), enterotoxigenic E. coli (8 isolates), and verotoxin-producing E. coli (1 isolate), and one isolate was categorized as unconventional DEC. Only 8 of the PCR-positive isolates would have been assumed to be pathogenic based on their O antigenicity, which highlights the limited effectiveness of serotyping. More than a half (51%) of the pathogenic isolates expressed a multidrug-resistant phenotype, which raises concerns about the therapeutic pediatric approach. The DEC isolates were heterogeneous phylogenetically, deriving from all four major groups: A (31 isolates), B2 (14 isolates), B1 (10 isolates), and D (6 isolates), respectively. Thus, the phylogenetic descent was less significant than the virulence gene content. Our findings document the importance of DEC as a cause of childhood diarrhea in Romania, providing evidence that efforts should be made to estimate the burden of infections by etiology for a better medical approach.",

STUDY DESIGN: The study population consisted of 36 term infants ranging in age from 14 to 81 days. We measured fecal calprotectin (a marker of neutrophil infiltration) by ELISA; stool microorganisms by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, cloning, and sequencing; and breath hydrogen levels using gas chromatography. RESULTS: During 24 hours, infants with colic (n = 19) cried and fussed for a mean of 314 +/- 36 (SEM) minutes, compared with control infants (n = 17, 103 +/- 17 minutes). Fecal calprotectin levels were 2-fold higher in infants with colic than in control infants (413 +/- 71 vs 197 +/- 46 microg/g, P = .042). Stools of infants with colic had fewer identifiable bands on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Klebsiella species were detected in more colic patients than in control patients (8 vs 1, P = .02), whereas Enterobacter/Pantoea species were detected only in the control patients. These differences could not be attributed to differences in formula versus breast milk feeding, consumption of elemental formula, or exposure to antibiotics.

			"abstract": "Noroviruses (NoV) are a major cause of epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis and affect all age groups worldwide. Three of five NoV genogroups, namely, genogroup I (GI), GII, and GIV, are associated with human disease. Unfortunately, these genogroups demonstrate a high degree of sequence diversity, complicating the design of pan-NoV diagnostic PCR tests. To decrease the risk of false-negative test results, we have developed a new one-step real-time TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR protocol. This protocol detects all human NoV genogroups in one reaction with a sensitivity of 400 virus genome equivalents/reaction for both GI and GII. The use of in vitro-transcribed NoV RNA as an external standard allows (semi)quantification of viral loads in samples. In a retrospective analysis of 206 stool samples from 77 patient episodes, the duration of NoV excretion and the amount of virus excreted were determined. Twenty (26.0%) of these episodes lasted longer than 10 days. Univariate risk factor analysis revealed the patient status after organ transplantation (odds ratio [OR], 7.49 [95% confidence interval, 2.06 to 28.32]; P < 0.001), immunosuppression (OR, 9.19 [95% confidence interval, 2.50 to 35.39]; P < 0.001), and age of less than 10 years (OR, 4.58 [95% confidence interval, 1.36 to 15.77]; P = 0.004) as risk factors for a NoV excretion period of more than 10 days. These findings were confirmed by time-dependent Kaplan-Meier analyses, whereas multivariate Cox regression analyses identified immunosuppression as the sole risk factor. Surprisingly, in contrast to the excretion periods, the viral loads in stools did not increase in connection with age or immunosuppressive status. This fact may be one important piece in the pattern of high-level NoV transmissibility and may have an impact on the development of transmission prevention strategies.",

METHODS: Excretion of vaccine poliovirus after challenge with OPV was measured in stool samples collected from children identified by the acute flaccid paralysis surveillance program in India during 2005-2007. The effectiveness of trivalent and monovalent OPV against excretion of each poliovirus type was estimated. RESULTS: Vaccine poliovirus was isolated from 4994 (5.2%) of 96,641 children with 2 stool samples. The relative odds of excreting challenge poliovirus among children with 5 reported previous doses of trivalent OPV compared with 0 previous doses was 0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.45), 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04-0.14), and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.19-0.85) for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively, but the relative odds increased to 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44-0.88), 0.44 (95% CI, 0.20-0.99), and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.41-1.06), respectively, in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In these 2 states, the relative odds of excretion of serotype 1 was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.26-0.41) after 5 doses of type 1 monovalent OPV. CONCLUSIONS: The mucosal immunity induced by OPV in India varies by location, serotype, and vaccine formulation.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast milk oligosaccharides such as galacto-oligosaccharides (scGOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (lcFOS) can influence the intestinal microbial flora. The latter, in turn, can modulate several intestinal and extraintestinal functions, including bilirubin metabolism. Supplementing infant formula with a prebiotic mixture might then be a novel and safe intervention to manage mild neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. AIM: To investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with prebiotics on moderate hyperbilirubinaemia in healthy, term infants. METHODS: A prospective, double-blind, clinical trial was performed on seventy-six consecutive newborns who were randomly assigned to receive a formula containing 0.8 g/dL of a mixture from scGOS and lcFOS (ratio 9:1), or maltodextrines as placebo for 28 days. Bilirubin levels were determined by the transcutaneous bilirubin measurement within 2 h after birth (T1), at 24, 48 and 72 h and at 5, 7, 10 and 28 days of life. The number of stool per day was also recorded. RESULTS: Neonates receiving prebiotics showed a larger number of stools over all the duration of dietary intervention compared to that of those on placebo (Repeated Measures ANOVA p < 0.001; day 28 3.4 +/- 0.0.9 vs 1.7 +/- 0.9, respectively; Dunn test p < 0.05). Neonates whose formula was supplemented with prebiotics showed a lower transcutaneous bilirubin that was statistically significant from 72 h of life (5.46 +/- 1.6 vs 7.07 +/- 2.49, post hoc Dunn test, p < 0.05) throughout the duration of the dietary intervention (day 28 2.41 +/- 0.4 vs 2.85 +/- 0.5, post hoc Dunn test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The addition of prebiotics to standard infant diet might represent a novel strategy to help control neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In seasonal influenza, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are sometimes observed, especially among young children. However, fecal excretion of seasonal influenza virus has seldom been studied. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of human influenza A virus in stool specimens of patients presented with symptoms of gastroenteritis. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study on 651 stool specimens collected from 627 patients of all age groups presented with symptoms of gastroenteritis during a 12-month period (December 2004-November 2005). Influenza A viral RNA was detected by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the matrix gene. Virus subtyping was performed by multiplexed H1- and H3-specific PCR. Fecal viral concentration was estimated by TaqMan-based real-time PCR. Clinical records of positive cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viral RNA was detected in 7 stool specimens collected from 6 patients. Their time of presentation coincided with local influenza season. All patients were at the extreme of ages (<5 or >60 years) or had underlying comorbidities, and had concurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. All required hospitalization and 1 patient died. Two patients with underlying lymphoma had the highest viral concentrations in their stool specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A viral RNA can be detected in stool specimens of 6 high-risk influenza patients with concurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Further investigation on the gastrointestinal involvement of seasonal influenza is required.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) and enteroviruses (EVs) belong to the family Picornaviridae. EVs are known to cause a wide range of disease such as meningitis, encephalitis, and sepsis. HPeV1 and 2 have been associated with mild gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms in young children. HPeV3 is associated with more severe neonatal infection. Little is known about the epidemiology and pathology of HPeV4-6 in children. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical symptoms of the children with an HPeV 4, 5, or 6 infection. The patients with positive HPeV4-6 in stool samples were selected and available plasma or cerebrospinal fluid samples from these patients were tested for HPeV. Data on clinical symptoms, diagnosis, presence and duration of fever, medical history, mean age, use of antibiotics of the children infected with HPeV4-6 were retrospectively documented. RESULTS: HPeV4-6 were found in 31 of the 277 HPeV positive children (11%). Coinfection with EV was seen in 8 patients. Fever was seen in 13 (42%) patients. Of the HPeV4-6 positive patients, 20 of the 31 children (64%) presented with gastrointestinal complaints and 18 of 31 (58%) patients had respiratory symptoms. The mean age was 14 months, 58% of the patients had an underlying disorder such as bronchomalacia or a cardiac disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic HPeV4-6 infections are seen in relative young children and are associated with respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. HPeV type 4 was detected more frequently than HPeV types 5 and 6.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an important cause of foodborne illness. In Australia, risk factors for STEC infection have not been examined at a national level. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in 6 Australian jurisdictions from 2003 through 2007. A case patient was defined as a person from whom STEC was isolated or toxin production genes were detected in stool. Case patients were recruited from notifiable disease registers, and 3 control subjects frequency matched by age were selected from databases of controls. Using structured questionnaires, interviewers collected data on clinical illness, foods consumed, and exposures to potential environmental sources. RESULTS: We recruited 43 case patients infected with STEC serogroup O157, 71 case patients infected with non-O157 serogroups, and 304 control subjects. One patient infected with serogroup O157 and 7 infected with non-O157 serogroups developed hemolytic uremic syndrome. Compared with control subjects, case patients infected with STEC O157 were more likely to eat hamburgers, visit restaurants, have previously used antibiotics, or have family occupational exposure to red meat. Case patients infected with non-O157 STEC were more likely to eat sliced chicken meat or corned beef from a delicatessen, camp in the bush, eat catered meals, or have family occupational exposure to animals. Negative associations were observed for certain foods, particularly homegrown vegetables, fruits, or herbs. CONCLUSION: This study of risk factors for STEC infection by serogroup highlights risks associated with eating hamburgers and occupational handling of raw meat. To prevent infection, hamburgers must be cooked thoroughly, and people handling raw meat or who have close contact with animals must ensure adequate hygiene.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The recently described WU (WUV) and KI (KIV) polyomaviruses have been primarily detected in respiratory samples, however other body sites have not been extensively investigated to date. The related human polyomaviruses JCV and BKV in contrast, have been detected in a wide range of sample types, leading to increased knowledge about their biology and pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate and compare the presence of JCV, BKV, WUV, and KIV in a variety of patient samples. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, faeces and urine from paediatric and adult immunocompetent and compromised patients were screened for the presence of the polyomaviruses by real-time PCR. The non-translated region (NTR) and VP1 of select WUV and KIV positive samples were sequenced and analysed. RESULTS: WUV and KIV were predominantly detected in NPA, BAL, and faeces from paediatric patients. JCV and BKV were primarily detected in blood, urine and faeces from adult patients. WUV and KIV NTR/VP1 sequence similarity ranged from 99.5% to 100% and 97.5-100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, WUV and KIV were detected in paediatric respiratory tract samples, in contrast to JCV and BKV, in which respiratory detections were uncommon. Additionally, the lack of WUV and KIV detections in blood, CSF, urine and adult faeces reinforces the parallel in divergent genomic phylogeny and apparent tissue tropism between JCV and BKV, and WUV and KIV. NTR/VP1 sequence variation did not appear to be associated with site of WUV or KIV detection.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In humans, the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the maintenance of host health by providing energy, nutrients, and immunological protection. Applying current molecular methods is necessary to surmount the limitations of classical culturing techniques in order to obtain an accurate description of the microbiota composition. RESULTS: Here we report on the comparative assessment of human fecal microbiota from three age-groups: infants, adults and the elderly. We demonstrate that the human intestinal microbiota undergoes maturation from birth to adulthood and is further altered with ageing. The counts of major bacterial groups Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). By comparing species diversity profiles, we observed age-related changes in the human fecal microbiota. The microbiota of infants was generally characterized by low levels of total bacteria. C. leptum and C. coccoides species were highly represented in the microbiota of infants, while elderly subjects exhibited high levels of E. coli and Bacteroidetes. We observed that the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes evolves during different life stages. For infants, adults and elderly individuals we measured ratios of 0.4, 10.9 and 0.6, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this work we have confirmed that qPCR is a powerful technique in studying the diverse and complex fecal microbiota. Our work demonstrates that the fecal microbiota composition evolves throughout life, from early childhood to old age.",

RESULTS: Antenatal MP was diagnosed in 14 fetuses between 18 and 38 weeks' gestation. The prenatal diagnosis of MP was confirmed by clinical and radiological findings in 8 (62%) of 13 infants born alive. All patients were delivered preterm between 33 and 36 weeks' gestation by cesarean section. Urgent neonatal surgery for treatment of bowel obstruction was required in all eight infants. Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of bowel dilatation was the only variable found to be associated with the need for subsequent surgical intervention (P=0.02).

Among the Escherichia coli (E. coli) causing intestinal diseases, there are six well-described categories: enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative contribution of different groups of diarrhoeagenic E. coli (DEC) in paediatric patients with diarrhoea. Clinical stool specimens from 380 children with diarrhoea, with ages ranging from birth to < 12 years, were selected for the study over a period of 17 months (August 2007 to December 2008). The study showed that 85/380 children (22%) had diarrhoea due to diarrhoeagenic E. coli. The most prevalent was enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) isolated from 46/85 paediatric patients (54%), followed by enterotoxigenic (ETEC) isolated from 19/85 (22.3%), enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) from 18/85 (21.1%) and enteroinvasive (EIEC) from 2/85 patients (2.3%). The most prevalent serotypes of EPEC were O86:K61 and O44:K74 isolated from 10/46 (21.7%), O128:K67 from 6/46 patients (13%), followed by O158:K- and O126:K71 isolated from 4/46 patients (8.6%). Among the ETEC the most prevalent serotypes were O78:K80 isolated from 10/19 (56.7%) and O25:K11 from 9/19 patients (47.3%), especially during the first twelve months: 9/19 patients (47.3%). The most prevalent EHEC strain found in this study was O145:K- and O103:K-: 5/18 patients (27.8%). Two isolated strains of EIEC belong to serotype O164:K-. The average age of the patients was 2 years. Two patients with bloody diarrhoea had EHEC serotype O157:H7 which progressed to haemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Our study shows that diarrhoeagenic E. coli is a significant causal agent of diarrhoeal diseases in paediatric patients in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This study is the first report about the frequency and most common serotypes of DEC in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additionally, it is the first report of cases with an O157:K- infection which progressed to HUS, a serious and potentially fatal illness.",

METHODS: It was a prospective study, conducted in a tertiary care hospital. A total 101 infants with neonatal cholestasis (NCS) were included in this study. Following a baseline hepatobiliary scintigraphic study (HBS), it was repeated after giving UDCA (40 mg/kg/day for 48-72 h). The sensitivity and specificity of clinical and investigational parameters were calculated with peroperative cholangiogram as gold standard. RESULTS: The mean age was 2.8 +/- 1.7 months and 82 were male. Of these, 35 were diagnosed to have BA and 66 had NH (idiopathic 25, sepsis/UTI 20, galactosaemia 11, TORCH 2 and others 8). Persistently clay stool was found to have modest accuracy (79%) and the accuracy of HBS improved significantly following UDCA therapy (91% from 77%, p < 0.01) whereas liver biopsy was 100% accurate in differentiating BA from NH. The outcome of BA cases with ductal plate malformation (DPM) was worse. CONCLUSION: One-third of all NCS in India is due to BA and among the intrahepatic causes acquired infection and galactosaemia are common.

In total, 2,782 stool specimens from hospitalized patients with AGE collected in October 2006 to September 2007 in Seoul were tested for HAV. A pair comparison of the nucleic acid sequence of a 159-bp base region at the putative VP1/2A junction of 85 Seoul isolates revealed that the most common HAV strain circulating in the region during 2006-2007 was subgenotype IA.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, skin swabs, stool and urine samples were collected from 30 infants at 2 weeks, 10 weeks and 7 months of age when the infants were healthy, and from infants of 7 months of age when they had a cold. Samples were cultured and Staphylococcus aureus isolates identified. Isolates were tested for the production of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1). Urine samples were analysed for the presence of these toxins by ELISA. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal carriage of S aureus decreased with age from 50% at 2 weeks of age to 13% in healthy infants at 7 months of age. Carriage was increased in infants over 7 months of age with a cold (36%). Stool carriage remained constant (37-40%) in healthy infants but increased significantly in infants over 7 months of age with a cold (82%). 13.9% of the isolates produced SEB, 16.7% produced SEC and 18% produced TSST-1. Some isolates produced more than one toxin. 43% of infants were colonised at some time with a toxigenic S aureus strain. S aureus toxins were detected in 9/101 urine samples. The proportion of positive samples was increased with infection and at 10 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: Infants are exposed early in life to S aureus pyrogenic toxins, which can be detected in infant urine samples. Age and infection affect the proportion of positive samples. The pattern of results can be explained by episodes of transient bacteraemia.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although uncommon, iron deficiency (ID) occurs in breastfed infants. The regular provision of iron may prevent ID. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of 2 modalities of providing iron (medicinal iron or iron-fortified cereal) to breastfed infants. The study tested the hypothesis that regular provision of iron improves iron status of breastfed infants without adverse effects. DESIGN: In this prospective, randomized, open-label trial, breastfed infants received on a regular basis either medicinal iron (n = 48) or an iron-fortified fruit-cereal combination (n = 45) from 4 to 9 mo or no intervention (control group; n = 59). The interventions provided 7.0-7.5 mg ferrous sulfate/d. Infants were enrolled at 1 mo and were followed to 2 y. Iron-status indicators were determined periodically, stool characteristics were recorded, and growth was monitored. RESULTS: The regular provision of iron led to improved iron status during and for some months after the intervention. Both sources of iron were about equally effective. Iron affected stool color but had no effect on feeding-related behavior. However, medicinal iron was associated with a small but significant reduction in length gain and a trend toward reduced weight gain. ID anemia was observed in 4 infants (2.3%), most of whom had a low birth iron endowment. Mild ID was common in the second year of life. CONCLUSIONS: Regular provision of medicinal iron or iron-fortified cereal improves the iron status of breastfed infants and may prevent ID. Both modalities are equally effective, but medicinal iron leads to somewhat reduced growth. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00760890.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meconium peritonitis (MP) develops when bowel perforation occurs in utero or soon after birth, resulting in leakage of meconium into the peritoneal cavity. The clinical features are often variable and prenatal ultrasonography plays an important role in prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of neonates diagnosed with MP in our hospital from January 1998 to December 2007. Prenatal examinations, postnatal presentations, investigations, management, patient outcomes, and possible causes were analyzed. RESULTS: Ten patients (five boys, five girls) diagnosed with MP were studied. The most common prenatal ultrasonographic finding was fetal ascites (7/10, 70%), followed by polyhydramnios (3/10, 30%), bowel dilatation (3/10, 30%), intra-abdominal calcification (1/10, 10%), and hydrops fetalis (1/10, 10%). Two of our patients were completely normal on prenatal ultrasonography. Only one MP diagnosis (1/10, 10%) was definitely confirmed by prenatal ultrasonography due to the presence of ascites, bowel perforation and intra-abdominal calcification. Nine patients (90%) required surgical intervention because of bowel perforation (5), bowel atresia (2), obstruction due to ileus (1), and intussusception (1). Peritonitis was of cystic type in one case (10%), fibroadhesive in five cases (50%), and generalized in four cases (40%). All 10 patients survived without long-term gastrointestinal complications. CONCLUSION: Prenatal ultrasonography can be diagnostic for MP, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with ascites or abdominal distension at birth. Close observation of postnatal clinical manifestations and timely surgical intervention resulted in a high survival rate and favorable outcome in these patients at our hospital.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously documented significant decreases in chlorpyrifos concentrations in maternal personal and indoor air samples among pregnant African-American and Dominican women from New York City after the 2000-2001 restrictions on its residential use. OBJECTIVE: We undertook a biomarker validation study within the same cohort to evaluate trends over time in multiple biomarkers of prenatal chlorpyrifos exposure. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled between February 2001 and May 2004 (n = 102). We measured 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) in postpartum meconium (n = 83), repeat prenatal maternal spot urine samples (n = 253), and postnatal urine from the mothers (n = 73) and newborns (n = 59). We measured chlorpyrifos in postnatal maternal (n = 92) and umbilical cord (n = 65) blood. RESULTS: We did not detect TCPy in infant urine, but all other biomarkers showed a highly significant decrease in detection frequencies (chi2 = 7.8-34.0, p < or = 0.005) and mean ranks (p < or = 0.006, Kruskal-Wallis) among subjects enrolled in 2003-2004 compared with those enrolled in 2001-2002. Chlorpyrifos in maternal personal and indoor air declined 2- to 3-fold over the same period (p < 0.05). In 2001-2002 samples, TCPy levels in repeat prenatal urine were positively correlated (r = 0.23-0.56), but within-subject variability exceeded between-subject variability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.43); indoor air levels explained 19% of the variance in prenatal urine TCPy (p = 0.001). Meconium TCPy concentrations were positively correlated with chlorpyrifos in maternal and cord blood (r = 0.25-0.33, p < 0.05) and with TCPy in maternal urine (r = 0.31, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the biomarkers are reliable dosimeters to differentiate between groups with prenatal chlorpyrifos exposures varying by a factor of 2 or more and vividly illustrate the efficacy of residential restriction on chlorpyrifos to reduce the internal dose during pregnancy.",

Fecal samples from 110 healthy pregnant mothers within 1 mo before delivery and their babies at 1 mo of age and 100 vaginal swabs from the mother within 7 d before delivery were collected at a maternity hospital in Fukuoka city, Japan. The fecal and vaginal samples were assayed by PCR to detect Bifidobacterium species and by real-time PCR assays to estimate the bifidobacterial number. The detection of Bifidobacterium breve in the mothers' feces was significantly associated with increases in both the bifidobacterial counts and number of Bifidobacterium species in the babies' feces. In addition, a cesarean section was significantly associated with both a decrease in the counts and diversity of bifidobacteria in the babies' feces. The number of Bifidobacterium species detected in the vaginal swabs of mothers were not associated with either the bifidobacterial counts or the diversity of bifidobacteria in the babies' feces. The most important determinants of intestinal bifidobacteria in infants were the colonization of B. breve in the mothers' gut and vaginal delivery.",

Three species of Lactobacillus (L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (L. casei, L. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. All lactobacilli were able to attach to the Caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. The adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). The inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal L. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. The inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated L. acidophilus (p > 0.01). The number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the Caco-2 cells decreased when the number of L. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) CFU/mL.

Partial VP(1) amplification and sequence analysis are reliable methods for identifying non-polio enterovirus serotypes, especially in negative cell culture specimens from patients with residual paralysis. OBJECTIVES: In Iran during the years 2000-2002, there were 29 residual paralysis cases with negative cell (RD, HEp(2) and L(20)B) culture results. STUDY DESIGN: The genomic RNA was extracted from stool specimens from cases of residual paralysis and detected by amplification of the 5'-nontranslated region using RT-PCR with Pan-EV primers. Partial VP(1) amplification by semi-nested RT-PCR (snRT-PCR) and sequence analysis were done. RESULTS: Specimens from the 29 culture-negative cases contained echoviruses of six different serotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The global eradication of wild polioviruses is near and study of non-polio enteroviruses, which can cause poliomyelitis, is increasingly important to understand their pathogenesis. The VP(1) sequences, derived from the snRT-PCR products, allowed rapid molecular analysis of these non-polio strains.",

			"article_name": "A novel bocavirus associated with acute gastroenteritis in Australian children.",
			"abstract": "Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common illness affecting all age groups worldwide, causing an estimated three million deaths annually. Viruses such as rotavirus, adenovirus, and caliciviruses are a major cause of AGE, but in many patients a causal agent cannot be found despite extensive diagnostic testing. Proposing that novel viruses are the reason for this diagnostic gap, we used molecular screening to investigate a cluster of undiagnosed cases that were part of a larger case control study into the etiology of pediatric AGE. Degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP) PCR was used to non-specifically amplify viral DNA from fecal specimens. The amplified DNA was then cloned and sequenced for analysis. A novel virus was detected. Elucidation and analysis of the genome indicates it is a member of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvovirinae, 23% variant at the nucleotide level from its closest formally recognized relative, the Human Bocavirus (HBoV), and similar to the very recently proposed second species of Bocavirus (HBoV2). Fecal samples collected from case control pairs during 2001 for the AGE study were tested with a bocavirus-specific PCR, and HBoV2 (sequence confirmed) was detected in 32 of 186 cases with AGE (prevalence 17.2%) compared with only 15 controls (8.1%). In this same group of children, HBoV2 prevalence was exceeded only by rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%) and was more prevalent than norovirus genogroup 2 (13.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%). In a univariate analysis of the matched pairs (McNemar's Test), the odds ratio for the association of AGE with HBoV2 infection was 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2-5.7); P = 0.007. During the course of this screening, a second novel bocavirus was detected which we have designated HBoV species 3 (HBoV3). The prevalence of HBoV3 was low (2.7%), and it was not associated with AGE. HBoV2 and HBoV3 are newly discovered bocaviruses, of which HBoV2 is the thirdmost-prevalent virus, after rotavirus and astrovirus, associated with pediatric AGE in this study.",

Intestinal bacteria have an important function; however no causative pathogen has been identified. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are differences in microbial patterns that may be critical to the development of this disease. Fecal samples from 20 preterm infants, 10 with NEC and 10 matched controls (including 4 twin pairs) were obtained from patients in a single site level III neonatal intensive care unit. Bacterial DNA from individual fecal samples was PCR-amplified and subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and library sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize diversity and structure of the enteric microbiota. The distribution of samples from NEC patients distinctly clustered separately from controls. Intestinal bacterial colonization in all preterm infants was notable for low diversity. Patients with NEC had even less diversity, an increase in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, a decrease in other bacteria species, and had received a higher mean number of previous days of antibiotics. Our results suggest that NEC is associated with severe lack of microbiota diversity that may accentuate the impact of single dominant microorganisms favored by empiric and widespread use of antibiotics.",

A group of 126 newborns were randomised to receive a prebiotic-containing starter formula supplemented with Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis or the same formula without probiotics for the first 3 months of life. A total of eighty infants continued the study until they were aged 6 months. Growth measurements were taken monthly at healthy baby clinics. Diaries were used to monitor behaviour, infections, use of antibiotics, as well as stool characteristics. Normal growth occurred in all infants and no statistically significant differences were detected between the probiotics group and the control group for gain in weight, length and head circumference. Infants in the probiotics group produced softer and more frequent stools during the first 3 months of life. No differences were found in crying and sleeping hours, number of parent-diagnosed infections, antibiotic use, visits to the general practitioner and number of adverse events. The use of a prebiotic-containing starter formula supplemented with L. paracasei ssp. paracasei and B. animalis ssp. lactis in early infancy is safe, well tolerated and has no adverse effects on growth and infant behaviour.",

The prevalence of DEC (enterotoxigenic [ETEC], enteropathogenic [EPEC], enteroinvasive [EIEC], enterohemorrhagic [EHEC] and enteroaggregative [EAEC]) was studied in 537 children < or = 5 years old hospitalised with acute diarrhoea and 113 matched controls from two hospitals during 2005-07 by PCR assays using E. coli colony pools. RESULTS: The prevalence of DEC varied from 0.75% for EHEC to 8.4% for EPEC (mostly atypical variety) in diarrhoeal children with no significant differences compared to that in control children (P values 0.15 to 1.00). Twenty-seven EPEC isolates studied mostly belonged to non-traditional serotypes and possessed beta and theta intimin subtypes. A total of 54 DEC isolates from diarrhoeal children and 4 from controls studied for antimicrobial susceptibility showed resistance for older antimicrobials, ampicillin (0 to 100%), tetracycline (33 to 100%) and trimethoprim (22.2 to 100%); 43.1% of the isolates were multidrug-resistant (resistant to 3 or more agents). Six (10.4%) DEC isolates produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases and possessed genetic elements (blaCTX-M, blaTEM and ISEcp1) associated with them. CONCLUSION: We speculate that the lack of significant association of DEC with diarrhoea in children in Kuwait compared to countries surrounding the Arabian Gulf Region may be attributable to high environmental and food hygiene due to high disposable income in Kuwait.",

METHODS: Information on children's stool patterns and gut symptoms collected by questionnaire at 4 weeks and at 6, 18, 30 and 42 months of age were available for 12,984 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Data on the 78 children identified by local health and/or education systems to have special educational provision for ASD were compared with the 12,906 remaining children in the cohort. RESULTS: Comparison of the ASD and control group during the first 3.5 years of life showed no major differences in stool colour or consistency, or in frequency of diarrhoea, constipation, bloody stools or abdominal pain. The ASD children had similar stool frequency up to 18 months, but there was a trend for ASD children to pass more stools at 30 months (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.11 to 12.6; p = 0.004) and at 42 months (OR 6.46, 95% CI 1.83 to 22.7; p<0.001), although only three children passed more than 4 stools/day.

Our objective was to determine, by use of modern diagnostic methods, the proportion of diarrhea cases in Bangladesh attributable to Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia assemblages A and B. METHODS: A prospective case-control study was performed involving 3646 case patients (both children and adults) who presented with diarrhea to the Dhaka hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and 2575 control subjects with asymptomatic infection. Parasitic infection was detected by use of a stool parasite antigen test, and the parasite load and the species and/or genotypes were determined by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Cryptosporidium species and E. histolytica were more prevalent in patients with acute diarrhea than in healthy control subjects, for all ages (2.1% vs. 1.4%; P = .039) and, specifically, for those 0-12 months of age (2.2% vs. 0.4%; P = .009). G. lamblia assemblage A was also more prevalent in case patients with diarrhea than in healthy control subjects (20% vs. 5%; P = .001). For case patients with diarrhea, the parasite load in feces, as measured by quantitative real-time PCR cycle threshold, was not higher that that for control subjects with asymptomatic infection. Case patients with diarrhea and cryptosporidiosis were less likely to have abdominal pain, compared with control subjects (15% vs. 37%; P = .001); case patients with amebiasis more likely to have visible blood in stool, compared with control subjects (8% vs. 1.6%; P = .001); and case patients with giardiasis more likely to be dehydrated, compared with control subjects (81% vs. 71%; P = .001).

In the first month of the outbreak, nine cases of necrotizing enterocolitis were diagnosed (one patient developed massive intestinal necrosis). The infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic) presented a bimodal distribution caused by a new outbreak of rotavirus type P4G2 after two patients who had acquired the infection outside the hospital were admitted when the first outbreak was subsiding. The characteristics of cases and controls were analysed using bivariate and multivariate methods (non-conditional multivariate logistic regression) to identify four risk factors strongly associated with rotavirus infection: premature birth, infections other than rotavirus, malformation, and changes in glycaemia and/or presence of jaundice.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastroenteritis is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Rotavirus, human caliciviruses (HucV), adenovirus, and astrovirus are recognized as common etiologies of acute gastroenteritis. OBJECTIVES: To use antigen detection and molecular methods to determine the viral etiology of childhood diarrhea in Lanzhou, China, 2005-2007. STUDY DESIGN: 544 stool specimens were collected from children hospitalized with diarrhea. ELISA, RT-PCR, or PCR were used to detect viruses commonly causing diarrhea. RESULTS: Group A rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus, were detected in 54.0%, 9.2%, 1.1%, 3.3%, and 4.4%, respectively. No group B or group C rotaviruses were detected. The relative contribution of these viruses changed greatly over 2 years. The percentage of rotavirus and adenovirus dropped from 61.2% and 5.4% to 47.6% and 1.4%, whereas HucV increased from 5.0% to 15.0%. G1 and P[8] were the predominant rotavirus strains, and P[6] was detected for the first time in this area. The predominant norovirus strain changed from GII3 to GII4, and the subtypes of GII4 changed from the Hunter strain to the variant 2006b strain. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of viruses and genotypes of individual viruses causing gastroenteritis in Lanzhou, China changed greatly during 2005-2007.",

METHODS: H. pylori status of 180 women was preliminarily screened by serology and stool antigen test (SAT) within the fourth day after delivery and a positive value was confirmed by (13)C-urea breath test. Infants were analyzed by SAT at 1, 6, 12 and 18 months of age. H. pylori status was also investigated in the medical and paramedical staff of the Neonatology Unit. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was found in 34.4% of the women. At the 1(st) month of age, 5 out of 172 newborns (2.9%) were H. pylori positive by SAT. Three out of the five positive infants were born to H. pylori non-infected mothers. Formula feeding (P=0.02) and admission in intermediate-risk neonatal unit (P=0.01) were significantly related to a positive H. pylori result. Medical and paramedical staff of the neonatology unit was found H. pylori positive in 34.8% of cases. All five H. pylori positive children spontaneously cleared the infection. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal H. pylori SAT positive status is low in our area, and it may be found both in infants from infected or non-infected mothers. Formula feeding and admission in intermediate-risk neonatal unit appear to be related with H. pylori infection.",

Defective jejunal brush-border Na(+)/H(+) exchange has been reported in three sporadic patients, but the molecular basis of the disease has not been elucidated. We reviewed data from a large cohort of CSD patients (n = 24) and distinguished CSD associated with choanal or anal atresia, hypertelorism, and corneal erosions--i.e., a syndromic form of CSD--occurring in ten families from an isolated form--i.e., classic CSD--presenting in seven families. Patients from both groups have a high risk of mortality due to immediate electrolyte imbalances and complications from long-term parenteral nutrition in the first years of life, but survivors can eventually adapt to partial or complete enteral nutrition. A genome-wide SNP scan was applied and identified a homozygous c.593-1G-->A splicing mutation in SPINT2, encoding a Kunitz-type serine-protease inhibitor, in one extended kindred with syndromic CSD. The same mutation and four distinct, homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (p.Y163C, c.1A-->T, c.337+2T-->C, c.553+2T-->A) were identified in all syndromic patients. No SPINT2 mutations were found in classic-CSD patients. SPINT2 mutations were associated with loss of protein synthesis or failure to inhibit the serine protease trypsin in vitro. We delineate syndromic CSD as a distinct disease entity caused by SPINT2 loss-of-function mutations. SPINT2 mutations might lead to an excess of yet unknown serine protease activity in affected tissues.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of RT-PCR for diagnosis of group A rotaviruses is increasing, but up to 14% of healthy individuals may be positive by RT-PCR. If RT-PCR is not well correlated with disease, rotavirus A may not always be the cause of illness in RT-PCR positive patients with infectious intestinal disease (IID). OBJECTIVES: To describe the differences in faecal viral load between ELISA positive IID cases, RT-PCR positive cases and healthy controls. To develop a cut-off in faecal viral load for attributing illness to rotavirus A in RT-PCR positive IID cases. STUDY DESIGN: Faecal viral load was measured, using real time RT-PCR, in 118 community IID cases and 65 healthy controls, previously tested by ELISA. Cycle threshold (Ct) values from the real-time RT-PCR were used as a proxy measure of viral load. A cut-off for attributing illness to rotavirus A was selected, using ROC analysis. RESULTS: There was little overlap in viral load between ELISA positive IID cases (median Ct 17) and healthy controls (median Ct 37), but ELISA negative, RT-PCR positive IID cases (median Ct 37) had viral loads similar to healthy controls, indicating that RT-PCR is not detecting extra cases of group A rotavirus associated IID, only sub-clinical infections. The optimal cut-off in the real time RT-PCR was at Ct value 24-27. CONCLUSION: ELISA is the best method for the laboratory diagnosis of rotavirus A associated IID. If RT-PCR is used, it is advisable to use a real time platform and to use a viral load cut-off equivalent to the detection limit of ELISA.",

			"article_name": "WITHDRAWN: Amnioinfusion for meconium-stained liquor in labour.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amnioinfusion aims to prevent or relieve umbilical cord compression during labour by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity. It is also thought to dilute meconium when present in the amniotic fluid and so reduce the risk of meconium aspiration. However, it may be that the mechanism of effect is that it corrects oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid), for which thick meconium staining is a marker. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of amnioinfusion for meconium-stained liquor on perinatal outcome. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (October 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2001) were searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion for women in labour with moderate or thick meconium-staining of the amniotic fluid. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer. MAIN RESULTS: Twelve studies, most involving small numbers of participants, were included. Under standard perinatal surveillance, amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in the following: heavy meconium staining of the liquor (relative risk 0.03, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.15); variable fetal heart rate deceleration (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.88); and reduced caesarean section overall (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.97). No perinatal deaths were reported. Under limited perinatal surveillance, amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in the following: meconium aspiration syndrome (relative risk 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48); neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (relative risk 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.56) and neonatal ventilation or intensive care unit admission (relative risk 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.79); there was a trend towards reduced perinatal mortality (relative risk 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 1.06). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Amnioinfusion is associated with improvements in perinatal outcome, particularly in settings where facilities for perinatal surveillance are limited. The trials reviewed are too small to address the possibility of rare but serious maternal adverse effects of amnioinfusion.",

This occurred following exposure to a colonised healthcare worker during an outbreak in an intermediate-risk neonatal unit. In total, 120 neonates admitted consecutively during a three-month period were screened for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae by rectal swabbing and 27 were identified as colonised. Multivariate analysis showed colonisation to be independently associated with use of antibiotics and absence of breastfeeding. Previous use of antibiotics presented an odds ratio (OR) of 12.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.66-41.2, P<0.001]. The most commonly used antibiotics were penicillin and amikacin. Breastfeeding was associated with reduced risk for colonisation (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.05-0.99; P=0.049). Nine isolates recovered during the first stage of the outbreak and 27 isolates from surveillance cultures were typed thereafter by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, revealing six different profiles (A-F). Clones A, C, and E were implicated in the first stage of the outbreak, whereas among the 27 strains recovered from surveillance cultures, all six clones were identified. Clone A was also found on the hand of a nursing auxiliary with onychomycosis. We concluded that prior antimicrobial use predisposed to colonisation. The possible role of breastfeeding as a protective factor needs to be further elucidated. Detection of different genotypes of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae suggests that dissemination of mobile genetic elements bearing the ESBL gene may have been superimposed on the simple dissemination of a clone during the outbreak.",

Methamphetamine (MAMP) and amphetamine (AMP) have previously been observed in meconium of MAMP-exposed neonates; the presence of other metabolites has not been investigated. Detection of such analytes may lead to more sensitive identification and thus improved medical treatment of affected infants. Forty-three MAMP-positive meconium specimens were analyzed for newly identified MAMP biomarkers, p-hydroxymethamphetamine, p-hydroxyamphetamine, and norephedrine. Due to MAMP adulteration in illicit ecstasy and to simultaneously monitor 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and MAMP prenatal exposure, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, its metabolites, and related sympathomimetic amines were assayed. MAMP, AMP, and unconjugated p-hydroxymethamphetamine were the most prevalent and abundant analytes present in meconium; however, unconjugated p-hydroxyamphetamine and norephedrine also were identified. It is possible that one of these additional analytes could be important for predicting toxicity or maternal or neonatal outcome measures in fetuses exposed to MAMP at specific gestational ages or with different metabolic capabilities. Although these new biomarkers were present in lower concentrations than MAMP and AMP in the meconium of previously confirmed specimens, additional research will determine if inclusion of these analytes can increase identification of MAMP-exposed neonates. Novel methamphetamine biomarker concentrations were characterized in meconium of infants exposed in utero to MAMP.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute diarrhea disease is the second cause of death among all infectious diseases in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. The aim of this study was to employ a combination of biochemical, microbiological and molecular diagnostic techniques to investigate the stools of Iranian children with acute diarrhea for bacterial enteropathogens. METHOD: Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Yersinia spp., were investigated from June 2003 to June 2005, in 1087 children less than 5 years old with acute diarrhea. Stool specimens from children were studied for enteropathogens both by standard culturing and molecular methods. This study was designed on hospital based. RESULT: The highest incidence values were found in the summer and in children less than 1-year-old (42.7%). The Pathogenic bacteria recovered out from fecal samples of 555 (55.1%) patients had the following profile: Shigella spp. (26.7%) was the most prevalent bacterial pathogen and Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli (STEC) and Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 105 (18.9%) and 92 (16.6%) had the second and third highest prevalence, respectively. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Campylobacter, Salmonella and Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were found in 70 (12.6%), 60 (10.8%), 42 (7.6%), and 38 (6.8%) positive samples, respectively. In this study neither Yersinia nor E. coli O157:H7 were found. Of the 30 co-infections detected, Shigella flexneri and Campylobacter jejuni accounted for more than 50%. CONCLUSION: Information about the prevalence of wide-range Shigella and STEC may facilitate the control and management of infant diarrhea diseases in Iran. The results of this study suggest that comprehensive surveys are needed in different parts of the country in order to identify the incidence of different enteropathogenic diarrhea, especially diarrheagenic E. coli in children in Iran.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: A birth cohort of 238 children was followed in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to determine incidence, prevalence, and epidemiologic factors related to Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: H. pylori infection was determined by a specific stool antigen test as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting specific IgA and IgG antibodies in sera in children who completed 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Using the stool antigen test and serology, 50% and 60% of infants respectively, were positive for H. pylori by 2 years; an increase in the infection rate was seen after 6 months of age. Determination of specific antibodies in sera and detection of H. pylori antigen in stool were comparable. A typical seasonality, peaking in spring and autumn, was observed for acquisition of initial H. pylori infection. Children with blood group \"A\" were more susceptible to H. pylori infection than those with other ABO blood groups. Malnutrition did not seem to promote colonization by H. pylori. However, H. pylori-infected children were more often infected by multiple enteropathogens, often isolated at different time points. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that noninvasive diagnostic methods such as serology and the stool antigen test are suitable for the study of acquisition of H. pylori infections in infants and can be used in field settings as well as in laboratories and clinical setting having less well equipped facilities. The study also shows seasonality for initial H. pylori infection and a relationship between blood group \"A\" and infection.",

To study the prevalence and genetic diversity of NoV in children in Tunisia, a total of 788 fecal samples were collected during a 4-year period in the region of Monastir, from children 12 years of age or younger, hospitalized or presenting in dispensaries with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. NoV was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by sequence analysis. This is the first report that describes the molecular epidemiology of NoV in Tunisian children: NoVs were characterized as the causative agent in 128 (16.2%) of the samples. Fourteen samples contained a mixture of two NoVs, and 33 samples were coinfected with additional enteric viruses. Eight distinct NoV genotypes were detected (GGI.2, GGI.4, GGII.1, GGII.4, GGII.8, GGII.14, GGIIb/GGII.2, and GGIIb/GGII.3). GGII.4 was the most prevalent genotype, accounting for 83 (64.8%) cases. Interestingly the GGII.4 variant Hunter, described as spreading all over the world in 2004, was found in Tunisia as early as January 2003. The delay of 1 year between the isolation in Tunisia and the worldwide emergence is somewhat surprising, considering the importance of the contacts between North Africa and Europe particularly. Nevertheless, this illustrates the idea that sporadic gastroenteritis cases may be a reservoir for emerging epidemic NoV strains.",

			"abstract": "The objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. Twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by F6PPK (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTi-PCR). Bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. Bifidobacterium breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum. PCR-DGGE revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. Sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as Bifidobacterium breve, B. adolescentis, B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. dentium. Bifidobacterial DNA was detected by qRTi-PCR in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16S rRNA gene copies per ml. In conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.",

In this double-blind, controlled, 28-day study, healthy term infants received control formula (control group; n = 25) or control formula supplemented with polydextrose (PDX) and galactooligosaccharide (GOS) (4 g/liter) (PG4 group; n = 27) or with PDX, GOS, and lactulose (LOS) (either 4 g/liter [PGL4 group; n = 27] or 8 g/liter [PGL8 group; n = 25]). A parallel breast-fed group (BF group) (n = 30) was included. Stool characteristics, formula tolerance, and adverse events were monitored. Fecal bacterial subpopulations were evaluated by culture-based selective enumeration (Enterobacteriaceae), quantitative real-time PCR (Clostridium clusters I, XI, and XIV, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Bifidobacterium). Fecal bacterial community profiles were examined by using 16S rRNA gene PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The daily stool consistency was significantly softer or looser in the BF group than in all of the groups that received formula. The formulas were well tolerated, and the incidences of adverse events did not differ among feeding groups. Few significant changes in bacterial subpopulations were observed at any time point. The bacterial communities were stable; individual profiles tended to cluster by subject rather than by group. Post hoc analysis, however, demonstrated that the bacterial community profiles for subjects in the BF, PG4, PGL4, and PGL8 groups that first received formula at a younger age were less stable than the profiles for subjects in the same groups that received formula at an older age, but there was no difference for the control group. These data indicate that formulas containing PDX, GOS, and LOS blends are more likely to influence gut microbes when administration is begun in early infancy and justify further investigation of the age-related effects of these blends on fecal microbiota.",

			"article_name": "Developing a systems approach to prevent meconium aspiration syndrome: lessons learned from multinational studies.",
			"abstract": "Passage of fetal bowel movement (meconium) is common (in about one out of six births), and in some the staining of the amniotic fluid is a sign of fetal distress. Inhalation of meconium (aspiration syndrome, in upto one out of five to eight such births) just before or at birth may be preventable by a coordinated approach by well-trained and informed birth attendants. Respiratory failure secondary to meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal population. Infants with hypoxemic respiratory failure because of MAS, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and pneumonia/sepsis have an increased survival with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Other treatment options earlier limited to inotropic support, continuous airway pressure (CPAP), conventional ventilatory management, respiratory alkalosis, paralysis and intravenous vasodilators have been replaced by synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), surfactant and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). HFOV has been advocated for use to improve lung inflation while potentially decreasing lung injury through volutrauma. Other reports describe the enhanced efficacy of HFOV when combined with iNO. Subsequent to studies reporting that surfactant deficiency or inactivation may contribute to neonatal respiratory failure, exogenous surfactant therapy has been implemented with apparent success. Recent studies have shown that iNO therapy in the neonate with hypoxemic respiratory failure can result in improved oxygenation and decreased need for ECMO. However, these innovative interventions are costly, require a sophisticated infrastructure and are not universally accessible. In this paper, a context of systems-approach for prenatal, natal and postnatal management of babies delivered through meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) so that adverse outcomes are minimized and the least number of babies require innovative ventilatory support is described. Previously reported data from a single urban perinatal center (Philadelphia, PA, USA), over a 6-year period (1995-2000), demonstrated that 14.5% (3370/23175 of live births babies were delivered with MSAF. These data also showed that 4.6% of babies (155/3370) with MSAF sustained MAS. Overall, 26% of babies (40/155) with MAS needed ventilatory support (or 0.17% of all live births); of these, only 20% (8/40 or 0.035% of live births) needed innovative ventilatory support. None died or needed ECMO. These data describe the components for a systems approach to prevent and manage adverse outcomes related to MSAF at the regional level II or III perinatal center. Replication of a similar strategy may be more relevant to cost containment and be a safer approach for neonates at risk for MAS-related respiratory failure. This paper assess the evidence for pivotal steps needed to prevent MAS and ensuing neonatal death and disease in the context of diverse perinatal health services.",

In fact, elevated PLA(2) activities together with high enzyme concentrations, especially the amount of pancreatic (group I) secretory PLA(2) (PLA(2)-I), have been detected in human meconium and in meconium-contaminated lungs. Recent data from our laboratory further indicate that human pancreatic PLA(2), introduced in high amounts within aspirated particulate meconium, is a potent inducer of lung tissue inflammatory injury. Our finding of elevated human PLA(2)-I concentrations in plasma during the first hours after intratracheal meconium administration in newborn piglets further suggests that intrapulmonary aspiration of meconium could also have systemic inflammatory and injurious effects.

Newborn piglets 2 to 5 days of age were made hypoxic and then instilled meconium or fractions of meconium intratracheally. Meconium-added albumin and albumin instilled after meconium were also tested. Lung function and inflammatory cytokines were measured. Both the lipid- and water-soluble fractions induce inflammation in the lungs with elevation of inflammatory cytokines. When meconium was mixed with albumin, the inflammatory effects of meconium were significantly ameliorated. Rescue therapy with intratracheal albumin 5 min after the meconium aspiration syndrome was induced also improved lung function. These results indicate that at least part of the symptoms seen in the meconium aspiration syndrome could be prevented by blocking the active substances of meconium such as bile acids and free fatty acids.",

Review of published experimental in vitro and in vivo MAS studies using human and animal lung cells. We found that meconium induces expression of cytokines and angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced apoptotic process in the lung cells. We postulate that inflammatory cytokines induce ANG II expression, which causes apoptotic cell death after binding to its AT1 receptors. We also demonstrated expression of serpins associated with meconium instillation into the lungs. Serpins are proteins that inhibit cellular proteases and elastases. Expression of serpins may be an attempt to recover lung from these injurious effects. In summary our studies show that whereas meconium induces inflammatory cytokines and subsequent cell apoptosis, the lung cells also try to protect themselves by inducing serpins. The balance of these interactions will determine the residual damage. We believe these new findings are very important in understanding of MILI.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine the dominant circulating NoV genotypes and strains associated with pediatric cases of acute gastroenteritis in Beijing, China. STUDY DESIGN: Fecal samples were obtained from 1126 children affected with acute gastroenteritis in Beijing from March 2004 to November 2007. NoV RNA was amplified, sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed to determine the dominant circulating genotypes and strains. RESULTS: NoVs were detected in 8.88% of patients, GII.4 being the dominant genotype. Ehime/05-30 was the dominant strain during 2004-2005, whereas 2006b dominated during 2006-2007. The homology of nucleotide and amino acid sequences among full-length VP1 of 15 randomly selected NoV strains was 91.6-99.6% and 94.5-99.6%, respectively. Recombination between NoV genotypes was frequent among the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant circulating genotype of NoV infections in Beijing is GII.4, but the dominant strains of this virus responsible for gastroenteritis epidemics are evolving rapidly. A global surveillance network may be needed to identify trends in molecular evolution of NoVs for prevention of future epidemics.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pregnant women were prospectively recruited from an agricultural site in the Philippines with substantial use at home and in the farm of the following pesticides: propoxur, cyfluthrin, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, pretilachlor, bioallethrin, malathion, diazinon and transfluthrin. Maternal hair and blood were obtained at midgestation and at delivery and infant hair, cord blood and meconium were obtained after birth. All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the above pesticides and some of their metabolites. RESULTS: A total of 598 mother/infant dyads were included in this report. The highest rates of pesticide exposure were detected in meconium (23.2% to propoxur, 2.0% to pretilachlor, 1.7% to cypermethrin, 0.8% to cyfluthrin, 0.7% to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis, p-chlorophenylethane (DDT) and 0.3% to malathion and bioallethrin) and in maternal hair (21.6% to propoxur, 14.5% to bioallethrin, 1.3% to malathion, 0.8% to DDT, 0.3% to chlorpyrifos and 0.2% to pretilachlor). Combined analysis of maternal hair and meconium increased detection rate further to 38.5% for propoxur and to 16.7% for pyrethroids. Pesticide metabolites were rarely found in any of the analyzed matrices. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant exposure of the pregnant woman and her fetus to pesticides, particularly to the home pesticides, propoxur and pyrethroids. Analysis of meconium for pesticides was the single most sensitive measure of exposure. However, combined analysis of maternal hair and meconium significantly increased the detection rate. A major advantage of analyzing maternal hair is that prenatal pesticide exposure in the mother can be detected and intervention measures can be initiated to minimize further exposure of the fetus to pesticides.",

Nineteen infants (79%) were diagnosed with enterovirus infection. In nine infants, both stool and cerebrospinal fluid were tested for enterovirus; both specimens were positive in three infants. In seven infants, only the stool and in three infants, only the cerebrospinal fluid was tested. The five infants without enterovirus infection were only partly tested; in four infants, only the stool and in one infant, only the cerebrospinal fluid was tested. Three infants (13%) were diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, one of which tested positive for enterovirus as well. Twenty-three infants received antibiotic treatment. The median duration of antibiotic treatment of infants without bacterial infection was 3.2 days. Thorough diagnostic evaluation for enterovirus in different specimens is important, as, often, only one specimen is positive for enterovirus. When enterovirus is diagnosed, patient management may be influenced.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are important antimicrobials for treating invasive salmonellosis, and emerging resistance to these antimicrobials is of paramount concern. This study reports on the antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular characterization of Salmonella enterica isolates recovered in 2006 from 0- to 3-year-old outpatients in China. METHODS: The isolates were subjected to serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, screening for beta-lactamase genes, mutations in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs), qnr alleles and aac-(6')-Ib-cr by PCR followed by DNA sequence analysis. All Salmonella Typhimurium isolates and 43 selected non-Typhimurium isolates were further characterized by PFGE to determine the genetic relatedness. RESULTS: From 3746 paediatric outpatient stool samples, 221 (5.9%) S. enterica isolates of 29 distinct serotypes were recovered. The antimicrobial resistance profiles differed among serotypes. Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were concentrated in serotype Typhimurium that were resistant to at least four additional non-quinolone antimicrobials. Nineteen out of 22 ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were grouped into one PFGE cluster. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant aac-(6')-Ib-cr was detected in 18 S. enterica isolates and 4 isolates also carried qnr alleles. Plasmid-mediated blaCTX-M-14-like genes were found in seven ceftriaxone-resistant isolates, and two isolates also exhibited reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, fluoroquinolones should not be used to treat the invasive Salmonella Typhimurium infections in this local community. The monitoring programme should stay vigilant for ceftriaxone-resistant S. enterica isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We assessed the incidence of rotavirus disease requiring an emergency department visit among children <5 years of age. METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for acute gastroenteritis in pediatric emergency departments in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Oakland, California, from March 1999 to May 2000, among children 2 weeks to 59 months of age with acute diarrhea and/or vomiting. We obtained clinical and demographic information from participants and tested their stool specimens for rotavirus. RESULTS: Approximately 9% of all emergency department visits at the study sites were attributable to acute gastroenteritis. A total of 1433 children were eligible at the 2 sites; 85% were enrolled and 68% provided a stool specimen. Overall, rotavirus was detected in specimens from 27% of children (30% in Cincinnati and 24% in Oakland). Rotavirus detection was higher in bulk stools, compared with rectal swabs, at both Cincinnati (37% vs 23%) and Oakland (46% vs 18%). Patients with rotavirus had more-severe disease than did those with nonrotavirus gastroenteritis. We estimated that the mean annual incidence of emergency department visits attributable to rotavirus was 12 cases per 1000 children in Cincinnati and 15 cases per 1000 children in Oakland. Through extrapolation, we estimated that rotavirus infection causes approximately 260,910 emergency department visits per year among US children. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance demonstrated that the burden of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus disease treated in emergency department settings among US children is substantial and greater than estimated previously.",

			"abstract": "Examination of faecal material by Kato Katz (KK) technique is a widely used approach for the diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis, particularly in epidemiological surveys. However, this technique lacks diagnostic sensitivity in individuals with low infection intensity or in low endemic areas. In the total population (TP) of 1265 individuals prevalence and infection intensity were established by examining two KK slides. A representative subset of 305 individuals, denominated experimental group (EG), was defined to assess the comparative advantage of an increased sampling effort using the KK technique. In addition stools of the participants of the EG were examined by the formol ether centrifugation technique. The proportion of all positive stool examinations detected by both methods among the experimental group served as reference value for prevalence (diagnostic 'gold' standard). Prevalence of schistosomiasis among TP based on two KK slides was 12.5%. Prevalence among the EG varied from 13.8%, based on one KK slide, over 27.2 based on 10 KK slides of three stool samples to 35.4% as value for the diagnostic 'gold' standard. The comparison of values for prevalence, stratified by age, revealed significant elevated numbers for all age groups, and interestingly, an extension of the highest prevalence levels until an age of 50 years. The overall infection intensity in eggs per gram (epg), calculated as geometric mean, was 83 epg for the TP based on one KK slide, 78 epg for the GE based on one KK slide and 28 epg based on 10 KK slides of three stool samples. In summary our data demonstrate that control programmes based on the examination of a single KK slide, as it is the case in Brazil, tend to underestimate significantly the prevalence and overestimate infection intensity. This applies especially for low endemic areas, where the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of such programmes become questionable. Our data also indicate that the possible solution of this problem lies in targeted mass treatment including age groups with the highest proportions of those infected. This will give high sensitivity together with sustainability and suitability under field conditions.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meconium aspiration syndrome has a complex pathophysiology. Meconium activates the complement system and meconium-induced cytokine formation is differentially mediated by complement and CD14. C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) regulates complement and contact-system activation mainly by protease inhibition, but may reduce inflammation by other mechanisms as well. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the initial mechanisms of meconium-induced complement activation and to study the effect of C1-INH on the meconium-induced inflammatory reaction. METHODS: Human serum from five donors was preincubated with an anti-MBL monoclonal antibody and then incubated with meconium for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Human cord whole blood, anticoagulated with lepirudin, from six donors was preincubated with C1-INH and then incubated with meconium for 30 min and 4h at 37 degrees C. Complement activation products specific for the different pathways were measured by ELISAs: classical pathway C1rs/C1-INH complexes, classical and lectin pathway C4d, alternative pathway C3bBbP, and terminal pathway sC5b-9 complex (TCC). A Bio-Plex Array Reader was used to measure 27 inflammatory mediators. RESULTS: The anti-MBL monoclonal antibody significantly reduced meconium-induced formation of C4d by 63% (p=0.0159) and TCC by 27% (p=0.0079). C1-INH dose-dependently inhibited meconium-induced formation of C1rs/C1-INH complexes, C4d, C3bBbP, and TCC compared to albumin (p<0.002 for all). C1-INH induced a dose-dependent and substantial inhibition of meconium-induced formation of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFalpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma (p<0.01 for all), the chemokines IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and eotaxin (p<0.02 for all), the growth factors G-CSF, GM-CSF, basic FGF, and PDGFbb (p<0.05 for all), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Meconium activated the lectin complement pathway as well as the alternative pathway. C1-INH efficiently reduced a broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators even at the lowest concentration. Administration of C1-INH may thus reduce the inflammatory response in MAS.",

Data on prevalence of HPeV genotypes are generally based on cell culture, which may underestimate the prevalence of certain HPeV strains that are difficult to grow. We studied 1,824 stool samples from 1,379 children (<5 years old) sent to the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, between 2004 and 2006. Samples were screened using specific human enterovirus (HEV) and HPeV real-time PCRs based on the 5' untranslated region. A high percentage of HPeV infections (16.3%), comparable to the percentage of HEV infections (18.4%), were found by PCR in stool samples. HPeV-positive stool samples were directly genotyped based on the VP1 region for the first time to avoid a culture bias. HPeV1 was found to be the most prevalent type. The majority of the HPeV1 strains clustered separately from the prototype strain, Harris, which has not been reported to circulate lately. However, we could identify three strains as HPeV1 Harris. HPeV3 was identified as the second most predominant type during 2004 and 2006 but was not found in 2005. HPeV4 to -6 were found in smaller numbers. One strain could not be associated with a known HPeV type (VP1 gene nucleotide similarity: 71%), possibly indicating a new genotype. Also, we report the first identification of three HPeV5 strains and one HPeV1 strain with a different motif at the C-terminal end of VP1, where the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif is normally located.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meconium analysis is a diagnostically sensitive and objective alternative to maternal self-report for detecting prenatal tobacco exposure. Nicotine and metabolite disposition in meconium is poorly characterized, and correlation of analytes' concentrations with neonatal outcomes is unexplored. Our objectives were to quantify nicotine, cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (OH-cotinine), nornicotine, norcotinine, and glucuronide concentrations in meconium, identify the best biomarkers of in utero tobacco exposure, compare meconium concentrations of tobacco-exposed and nonexposed neonates, and investigate concentration-outcome relationships. METHODS: We quantified concentrations of nicotine and 4 metabolites with and without hydrolysis simultaneously in meconium from tobacco-exposed and nonexposed neonates by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We compared meconium concentrations to birth weight, length, head circumference, gestational age, and 1- and 5-min Apgar scores. RESULTS: Nicotine, cotinine, and OH-cotinine were the most prevalent and abundant meconium tobacco biomarkers and were found in higher concentrations in tobacco-exposed neonates. Whereas cotinine and OH-cotinine are glucuronide bound, performing the lengthy and costly enzymatic hydrolysis identified only 1 additional positive specimen. Unconjugated nicotine, cotinine, or OH-cotinine meconium concentration >10 ng/g most accurately discriminated active from passive and nonexposed neonates. There was no significant correlation between quantitative nicotine and metabolite meconium results and neonatal outcomes, although presence of a nicotine biomarker predicted decreased head circumference. CONCLUSIONS: Unconjugated nicotine, cotinine, and OH-cotinine should be analyzed in meconium to detect in utero tobacco exposure, as approximately 25% of positive specimens did not contain cotinine. Immunoassay testing monitoring cotinine only would underestimate the prevalence of prenatal tobacco exposure.",

The mother influences the original inoculum and the development of infant microbiota, which in turn is associated with later weight gain. OBJECTIVE: We characterized the gut microbiota in women according to their body mass index (BMI) and the effect of weight gain over pregnancy on the composition of microbiota before delivery. DESIGN: Overweight women (n = 18) were selected according to their prepregnancy BMI from a prospective follow-up study. Normal-weight women (n = 36) were selected as controls in consecutive order of recruitment. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy was defined as >16.0 kg for normal-weight and >11.5 kg for overweight states according to Institute of Medicine recommendations. The composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry (FCM-FISH) and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Bacteroides and Staphylococcus were significantly higher in the overweight state than in normal-weight women as assessed by FCM-FISH and qPCR. Mother's weight and BMI before pregnancy correlated with higher concentrations of Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus. Microbial counts increased from the first to third trimester of pregnancy. High Bacteroides concentrations were associated with excessive weight gain over pregnancy (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota composition and weight are linked, and mother's weight gain is affected by microbiota.

The intestinal microbial flora could operate as an important postnatal regulator of the Th1/Th2 balance. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between early intestinal colonisation and the development of asthma in the first 3 years of life. METHODS: In a prospective birth cohort, 117 children were classified according to the Asthma Predictive Index. A positive index included wheezing during the first three years of life combined with eczema in the child in the first years of life or with a parental history of asthma. A faecal sample was taken at the age of 3 weeks and cultured on selective media. RESULTS: Asthma Predictive Index was positive in 26/117 (22%) of the children. The prevalence of colonisation with Bacteroides fragilis was higher at 3 weeks in index+ compared to index- children (64% vs. 34% p < 0,05). Bacteroides fragilis and Total Anaerobes counts at 3 weeks were significantly higher in children with a positive index as compared with those without. After adjusting for confounders a positive association was found between Bacteroides fragilis colonisation and Asthma Predictive Index (odds ratio: 4,4; confidence interval: 1,7 - 11,8). CONCLUSION: Bacteroides fragilis colonisation at age 3 weeks is an early indicator of possible asthma later in life.

A subset of 253 samples was also tested for norovirus by ELISA. Data were analyzed for seasonality of infection, patient nationality and likelihood of hospitalization. Although the overall incidence of rotavirus identification in acute diarrheal stool continued to decline, this was still the virus identified most commonly (6%). Norovirus accounted for 3.5%, astrovirus, 1.9% and adenovirus, 1.4%. Type G9 rotavirus was found to be present (and already common) in 2003, predating its first reported identification in the country in 2004. Most of the virus infections (and most of the G9 detections) occurred in April, the month following the occurrence of the Hajj in the study year. Although most viruses were spread equally in the population, rotaviruses were significantly more common in non-Saudis than in Saudi citizens. Overall the data are consistent with an increase in all virus infections following al Hajj and the potential introduction of novel strains (such as the G9 rotaviruses) by pilgrims.

			"abstract": "Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium emerged as a reliable, direct biological marker for establishing fetal exposure to ethanol. We developed an LC-MS/MS method for ethyl laurate, ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl palmitoleate, ethyl stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidonate using ethyl heptadecanoate as the internal standard. The analytes were extracted from meconium with hexane, followed by solid-phase extraction with aminopropyl-silica columns. Chromatography was performed on a C(8) reversed-phase column using water/isopropanol/acetonitrile (20:40:40, v/v/v) as a mobile phase. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that monitored the transitions in multiple reaction-monitoring mode was used for the detection of the analytes. Limits of quantification (LOQs) varied between 0.12 and 0.20 nmol/g. Calibration curves were linear from LOQs to 50 nmol/g for all analytes, with a minimum r(2)>0.99. At three concentrations spanning the linear dynamic range, mean recoveries ranged between 53.6 and 86.7% for the different analytes. The validated method was applied to analysis of meconium in newborns of two European cities. The two cohorts presented with different prevalence of gestational ethanol consumption during pregnancy.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calprotectin is a cytosolic component of neutrophils. Fecal calprotectin (FC) level is a useful marker for exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease in children. FC may be a useful marker for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). OBJECTIVE: To determine normal baseline levels of FC and observe dynamic changes of FC levels over the first postnatal month in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. METHODS: FC levels of 14 VLBW infants (gestational age 23-30 weeks, birth weight <or=1,500 g) were serially measured in the first postnatal month. Demographics, feeding regimens, antibiotic use, laboratory and x-ray results, and maternal information were recorded. We assessed how FC levels changed over time, varied with nutritional source and differed between sick versus well infants. RESULTS: FC levels were not related to gestational age or feedings regimen. FC levels tended to decrease with increasing age (p = 0.121) and feeding volumes (p = 0.179). FC levels differed between 'well' and 'sick' infants (122.8 +/- 98.9 vs. 380.4 +/- 246.3 microg/g stool, p < 0.001). FC >350 microg/g stool was noted with signs of gastrointestinal injury, such as bloody stool and bowel perforation. FC levels decreased after initiation of treatments in sick infants who recovered. CONCLUSIONS: FC levels may be a marker for early diagnosis and resolution of gastrointestinal illnesses in VLBW infants. Its utility for early diagnosis and assessment of resolution of NEC should be studied in a larger cohort of VLBW infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast milk is an important source of staphylococci and other bacterial groups to the infant gut. The objective of this work was to analyse the bacterial diversity in feces of breast-fed infants and to compare it with that of formula-fed ones. A total of 23 women and their respective infants (16 breast-fed and 7 formula-fed) participated in the study. The 16 women and their infants provided a sample of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 7, 14, and 35. The samples were plated onto different culture media. Staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling and to a characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits and sensitivity to antibiotics. RESULTS: The feeding practice had a significant effect on bacterial counts. A total of 1,210 isolates (489 from milk, 531 from breast-fed and 190 from formula-fed infants) were identified. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant species in milk and feces of breast-fed infants while it was less prevalent in those of formula fed-infants. Enterococcus faecalis was the second predominant bacterial species among the fecal samples provided by the breast-fed infants but it was also present in all the samples from the formula-fed ones. The biofilm-related icaD gene and the mecA gene were only detected in a low number of the S. epidermidis strains. Several enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cylA or the vanABDEG antibiotic-resistance genes. All were sensitive to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The presence of S. epidermidis is a differential trait of the fecal microbiota of breast-fed infants. Globally, the staphyloccal isolates obtained from milk and feces of breast-fed infants contain a low number of virulence determinants and are sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the genotypes of rotavirus strains causing dehydrating diarrhea in children in Uberaba, Triangulo Mineiro region, Minas Gerais, during 2005-2006. METHODS: Rotavirus-associated diarrhea was investigated in fecal specimens by PAGE and strains were characterized for their genotype by RT-PCR and PCR-typing assays. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 15% (39/260) of the fecal specimens by PAGE: 64% of the specimens presented short electrophoretic patterns and G2P[4] genotype; and 36% presented long electropherotypes and G1P[8], G9P[8], G4P[9] and two strains with sill undetermined G and P[8] genotype. A change in the dominant electrophoretic pattern was observed, shifting from long to short patterns and coinciding with the highest incidence of diarrheal cases. CONCLUSIONS: Those are the first data on rotavirus strains circulating in the Triangulo Mineiro region. They were obtained over a 16-month period that included the first 10 months after the launch of the national rotavirus immunization program that uses a monovalent G1P[8] attenuated vaccine strain. These results should further our understanding of the dynamics of rotavirus strains and help interpreting the significance of the program.",

No evidence for outbreak-like epidemic patterns was found. Phylogenetic analysis identified 3 distinct genetic lineages. Viral protein 1 amino acids were 67.9%-77.7% identical and had a distance of at least 39.4% from known cardioviruses.

			"abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract of neonates becomes colonized immediately after birth with environmental microorganisms, mainly from the mother; strong evidence suggests that the early composition of the microbiota of neonates plays an important role for the postnatal development of the immune system. The present study was designed to evaluate by means of a molecular biology approach the relation between the intestinal ecosystem of the newborn and the mode of delivery. The intestinal bacterial composition on d 3 of life was investigated in 23 infants born by vaginal delivery and in 23 infants delivered by cesarean section. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and PCR-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis have been utilized, together with the specific amplifications for 10 Bifidobacterium species, 3 Ruminococcus species, and Bacteroides. The intestinal microbiota of neonates delivered by cesarean delivery appears to be less diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The intestinal microbiota after cesarean delivery is characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. Vaginally delivered neonates, even if they showed individual microbial profiles, were characterized by predominant groups such as B. longum and B. catenulatum. Our data demonstrate that the mode of delivery has a deep impact on the composition of the intestinal microbiota at the very beginning of human life. This study opens the path to further investigations to confirm the link between microbiota composition and immune system development and to identify tools for the modulation of the intestinal microbiota of cesarean-delivered neonates. Additionally, we underline the importance of adequate microbiological tools used to support clinically relevant trials, if intestinal microbiota is considered as a study outcome.",

The objective of this study was the molecular characterization of rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and enteroviruses obtained from 367 children in the Northern Region of Ghana. One hundred and forty-two rotavirus-positive stool samples were examined. The most frequent type identified was G1P[8] occurring in 80% of the cases. Of 27 norovirus positive samples, 5 isolates belonged to genogroup I and 22 to genogroup II. Adenoviruses were detected in 73 samples; 23.3% of these belonged to genogroup F, 31.5% to D, 17.8% to A, 15.1% to C, and 12.3% to B. Astrovirus typing of 12 positive samples displayed a distribution into four different genotypes: five sequences clustered with AstV-8, four with AstV-2, two with AstV-5, and one with AstV-6. Twenty-three different enterovirus types were identified in 45 positive samples, coxsackievirus A24 being the most frequent pathogen (18%). This first, comprehensive molecular characterization of enteric viruses in northern Ghana provides baseline data for the molecular epidemiology of these pathogens and immunisation strategies. The available rotavirus vaccines cover the predominant G1P[8] type and would reduce substantially disease burden in that area.",

This study investigated the prevalence of NV, SV, and HAstV infections in children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Chiang Mai, Thailand from May 2000 to March 2002. Fecal specimens were tested for NV, SV, and HAstV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using degenerate specific primers. These viruses were characterized further by sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the partial capsid gene. From 296 fecal specimens tested, 13.5% (40 of 296) were positive for NV, SV, and HAstV. Of these, NV most predominant, with a prevalence of 60% (24 of 40), of which 17.5% were NVGI and 42.5% were NVGII. Of note, one specimen was positive for both NVGI and SV. SV was detected in 25%, while HAstV was detected in 17.5%. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that NVGI strains comprised GI/3, GI/4, GI/6, GI/7, and GI/13 genotypes. Among NVGII strains, approximately half of them belonged to genotype GII/4 (Lordsdale virus cluster), followed by GII/3, GII/10, GII/1, GII/6, GII/8, and GII/15. Analysis of SV sequences revealed that SVGI (Manchester virus) was more common than SVGII (London virus). The SV genotypes detected in this study belonged to SVGI/1, SVGI/4, SVGI/5, SVGII/1, and SVGII/2, whereas the HAstV belonged to genotypes HAstV-1, HAstV-2, HAstV-3, and HAstV-5.

Firstly, samples were collected from familial contacts during a period of rotavirus infection in children from the cohort. Secondly, on occasions when a family member had rotavirus diarrhea, samples from the cohort child were taken for analysis. Lastly, asymptomatic surveillance samples collected at predetermined time points from both the cohort child and familial contacts were analyzed. From 560 samples collected from family members during symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus infections in these children, three rotavirus transmissions were identified, accounting for a secondary attack rate of 0.54%. In four instances of rotavirus diarrhea in a family member, one infection was transmitted to the cohort child. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a high degree of similarity in all these pairs ranging between 99% and 100% at both the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid levels, highly suggestive of person-to-person transmission of rotavirus infection. There was complete concordance of rotavirus genotyping between these pairs. No transmission events were noted from 14 asymptomatic rotavirus infections identified during routine surveillance of family members.

We hypothesized that branched chain fatty acids (BCFA), long known to be major vernix components, would be found in meconium and that the profiles would differ systematically. Vernix and meconium were collected from term newborns and analyzed. BCFA-containing lipids constituted about 12% of vernix dry weight, and were predominantly saturated, and had 11-26 carbons per BCFA. In contrast, meconium BCFA had 16-26 carbons, and were about 1% of dry weight. Meconium BCFA were mostly in the iso-configuration, whereas vernix BCFA contained dimethyl and middle chain branching, and five anteiso-BCFA. The mass of BCFA entering the fetal gut as swallowed vernix particles is estimated to be 180 mg in the last month of gestation whereas the total mass of BCFA found in meconium is estimated to be 16 mg, thus most BCFA disappear from the fetal gut. The BCFA profiles of vernix and meconium show that BCFA are major components of normal healthy term newborn gastrointestinal tract. BCFA are candidates for agents that play a role in gut colonization and should be considered a nutritional component for the fetus/newborn.",

			"article_name": "Universal or targeted screening for fetal alcohol exposure: a cost-effectiveness analysis.",
			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this article, we compared the costs of testing meconium for alcohol exposure in newborns with the lifetime benefits of early detection and intervention. METHOD: A decision analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of testing meconium for two scenarios: (1) all infants in the Canadian province of Ontario and (2) infants who have an older sibling diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The model incorporated the costs of early screening, early intervention, and the lifetime societal benefits of early intervention. RESULTS: The cost of the meconium test is Can. $150. The lifetime societal cost of the disease is Can. $1.3 million per incident case. The benefit of early intervention is an improvement in literacy, which improves the quality of life parameter by 0.17 and increases adult lifetime earnings by $26,400 per year. The ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental benefits results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for mandating a universal screen of all newborns in Ontario of $65,874 per quality-adjusted life years. When considering targeted screening, there is a cost savings for society and improvements in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on society's willingness-to-pay threshold for improving infants' lives in a setting of considerable equity concerns, universal screening and targeted screening of infants who have an older sibling diagnosed with FASD both represent policies that are good value for the money.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic (a combination of pro- and prebiotic) supplements increasingly are being used to prevent and treat a variety of health conditions. Although colonization is considered a key element in the success of such treatments, few clinical studies have addressed colonizing ability. Studies are even more limited in neonates and infants, who may benefit most from such treatment. The present study was conducted to determine the colonizing ability, tolerance, and impact on the stool flora of 7 days of administration of a synbiotic supplement to a neonatal cohort, in preparation for a larger hospital-based trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-masked, controlled trial, healthy inborn newborns >35 weeks of gestational age and >1800 g birth weight were randomized between 1 and 3 days after birth to receive an oral synbiotic preparation (Lactobacillus plantarum and fructooligosaccharides) or a dextrose saline placebo. Two babies were treated with the synbiotic preparation for every 1 baby treated with the placebo. Duration of therapy was 7 days. Comprehensive stool cultures were done at baseline and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Nineteen infants received the active study supplement and 12 infants received the placebo for 7 days. L plantarum was cultured from the stools of 84% of the treated infants after 3 days of treatment, and from 95% of infants on day 28 after birth. Of the infants, 100%, 94%, 88%, 56%, and 32% remained colonized at months 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. In both groups, the total mean number of species and the mean log colony counts increased over time. The number of bacterial species was significantly higher on days 21 and 28 in the synbiotic preparation group compared with placebo (P = 0.002 and 0.03, respectively). There was a linear increase in the mean log gram-negative colony counts in the placebo group during the 4-week period that was significantly higher than that in the Lactobacillus group on days 14, 21, and 28 (P < 0.001 for each). In contrast, the supplement group had significantly higher gram-positive colony counts on days 14 (P = 0.002) and 28 (P = 0.04). Only 1 infant in the placebo group was colonized with L fermentum during the first 28 days of life. No difference was found in the percent increase in weight between baseline and day 7, but on day 28 and months 2, 3, and 6, the percent increase from baseline was higher in the probiotic-treated group (P </= 0.05). The supplement was tolerated well. CONCLUSIONS: The synbiotic preparation colonized quickly after 3 days of administration and the infants stayed colonized for several months after therapy was stopped. There was an increase in bacterial diversity and gram-positive organisms and a reduction of gram-negative bacterial load in the treatment group. Because a combination preparation was used, it is difficult to specifically attribute the colonization to either the probiotic or prebiotic component in this study. Larger efficacy trials are warranted to examine the mechanism of action and precise effects of these supplements.",

Among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic Escherichia coli, especially, EAEC was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Shigella species. Distinct seasonality was found in V. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed no age-specific patterns. However, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and B. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. However, both pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. Moreover, S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found.

In this study, we present the results of a 4-year prospective surveillance in the neonatal nurseries of a tertiary care hospital in south India. METHODS: Stool samples from neonates admitted for >48 hours either with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms or with nonenteric pathology were screened for rotavirus. Careful assessment of clinical data was carried out. G- and P-typing for all symptomatic rotavirus positive cases and equal number of asymptomatic controls from the same month was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 43.9% of 1411 neonates, including those with and without gastrointestinal disease. Rotavirus detection was significantly higher among neonates with GI disease (55.5%) than asymptomatic neonates (44.4%) (P < 0.001). Rotavirus was seen in association with diarrhea, vomiting, feed intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, hematochezia, gastroesophageal reflux, and abdominal distension. Diarrhea was significantly more frequent in neonates with rotavirus infection (P < 0.001) whereas uninfected neonates developed significantly more feeding intolerance (P < 0.001). Significantly greater proportion of term neonates with GI disease were positive for rotavirus than preterm neonates (P < 0.001).

			"abstract": "Our aim was to isolate bifidobacteria and clostridia from infant faeces and to test the growth of bifidobacteria and clostridia on prebiotic oligosaccharides. Seventy breast-fed infants aged between 3 and 253 days were tested for the presence of bifidobacteria and clostridia in their faeces. Ten strains of clostridia and 10 strains of bifidobacteria were isolated from infant faecal samples. Four strains of bifidobacteria originated from culture collections and 1 strain from fermented milk product were also tested. Subsequently, bacterial isolates were tested for their growth on prebiotic oligosaccharides in, in vitro conditions. Forty-six infants exhibited high numbers of bifidobacteria (usually higher than 9 logCFU/g) in their faeces. There were undetectable amounts of bifidobacteria in faecal samples in 24 of the studied infants (34%), these babies on the other hand possessed significant amounts of clostridia in their faecal flora. Both bifidobacteria and clostridia utilized all substrates tested. Bifidobacteria grew significantly better in the medium with galactooligosaccharides. Higher growth of clostridia was observed on raffinose and lactulose. Conversely, bifidobacteria grew slightly better in the medium with stachyose, inulin, Raftilose P85 and P95. However, these differences were not significant. Our results suggest that commercially available prebiotics support the growth of infant faecal clostridia. It is therefore questionable if bifidobacteria-deficient infants should be supplemented with prebiotics.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Very little is known about human rotaviruses in the northwest of China. To investigate the genomic diversity, we evaluated the distribution of rotavirus genotypes in this region covering a 10-year period (1996-2005). METHODS: Rotavirus antigen was detected in stool specimens by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and G and P genotyping was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing methods. RESULTS: A total of 783 stool specimens collected from children with diarrhea, under 5 years of age, attending an urban hospital in Xinjiang were tested for rotavirus antigen, and 398 (50.8%) were positive. Overall, the most prevalent rotavirus genotype was G1P[8] (40.0%), followed by G3P[8] (17.5%), G2P[4] (8.3%), and G2P[6] (6.5%). G1 rotavirus was the most prevalent genotype until 2004. However, in 2005, G3 rotavirus (51.9%) became a dominating strain. Only one G9 strain was isolated in this region (isolated for the first time in 1999) and it became a more prevalent strain (21.2%) in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are of importance to the decision makers in the evaluation of rotavirus vaccines in China.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Attaching and effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) that lack Shiga toxin genes (stx) and the enteropathogenic E. coli adherence factor (EAF) plasmid (stx-/EAF-) are classified as atypical enteropathogenic E. coli and cause diarrhea worldwide. However, it is unknown whether there are bacterial lineage-specific human disease phenotypes. We compared stx-/EAF- AEEC recovered from patients (mostly children) with bloody and nonbloody diarrhea. METHODS: stx-/EAF- AEEC were isolated using eae colony blot hybridization and were serotyped, tested (by polymerase chain reaction) for putative virulence genes, and analyzed for phylogenetic relationships by use of multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: During the period 1995-2007, stx-/EAF- AEEC were isolated as the only bacterial pathogens from stool specimens obtained from 18 (15.3%) of 118 patients with bloody diarrhea and from 141 (1.3%) of 10,550 patients with nonbloody diarrhea (P<.001). All but 1 of 18 strains recovered from patients with bloody diarrhea resembled enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) on the basis of serotypes, non-stx virulence profiles, and multilocus sequence types. In contrast, most (75.9%) of 141 stx-/EAF- AEEC recovered from patients with nonbloody diarrhea belonged to other serotypes and differed from the former strains phylogenetically and with regard to virulence genes. Three of 18 patients with bloody diarrhea and none of 141 patients with nonbloody diarrhea who shedded stx-/EAF- AEEC developed hemolytic uremic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Most stx-/EAF- AEEC associated with bloody diarrhea are plausibly EHEC that lost Shiga toxin during infection (EHEC-LST). To prevent serious complications of such infections, Shiga toxin-independent diagnostic strategies to accurately and rapidly identify such patients should be developed and applied. Multilocus sequence typing has potential to distinguish EHEC-LST from less pathogenic stx-/EAF- AEEC.",

			"abstract": "Information about norovirus (NoV) infections in Central America is limited. Through a passive community and hospital pediatric diarrhea surveillance program, a total of 542 stool samples were collected between March 2005 and February 2006 in Leon, Nicaragua. NoV was detected in 12% (65/542) of the children; of these, 11% (45/409) were in the community and 15% (20/133) were in the hospital, with most strains (88%) belonging to genogroup II. NoV infections were age and gender associated, with children of <2 years of age (P < 0.05) and girls (P < 0.05) being most affected. Breast-feeding did not reduce the number of NoV infections. An important proportion (57%) of NoV-infected children were coinfected with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. A significant proportion (18/31) of NoV-positive children with dehydration required intravenous rehydration. Nucleotide sequence analysis (38/65) of the N-terminal and shell region in the capsid gene revealed that at least six genotypes (GI.4, GII.2, GII.4, GII.7, GII.17, and a potentially novel cluster termed \"GII.18-Nica\") circulated during the study period, with GII.4 virus being predominant (26/38). The majority (20/26) of those GII.4 strains shared high nucleotide homology (99%) with the globally emerging Hunter strain. The mean viral load was approximately 15-fold higher in children infected with GII.4 virus than in those infected with other G.II viruses, with the highest viral load observed for the group of children infected with GII.4 and requiring intravenous rehydration. This study, the first of its type from a Central American country, suggests that NoV is an important etiological agent of acute diarrhea among children of <2 years of age in Nicaragua.",

In India eradication of poliomyelitis from states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar has been difficult due to high population and low-socioeconomic standards of living. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and intensive OPV rounds continues with the World Health Organization (WHO) operational strategies. Yet apparent lack of progress in reducing the number of wild cases has resulted in occasional impatience and frustration, even leading to questions about ultimate feasibility of global eradication using OPV. Lucknow in UP is in geographical area endemic for poliomyelitis and is surrounded by high-risk areas yet maintains a polio-free status since 2002. Environmental surveillance study was conducted (2004-2006) to authenticate the decline in the wild poliovirus (PV) cases in Lucknow. Sewage sample analyses were compared with stools of AFP patients and healthy children from same geographical area. Study reveals useful information on OPV circulation and proves important epidemiological tool to trust WHO's OPV immunization program. Genetic sequencing had detected silent wild PV-1 circulation of RCP1PGI (EU049849), RCP2PGI (EU049850), RCP3PGI (EU049851), and RCP4PGI (EU049852) in sewage waters. Properties of isolates from sewage reflected those of viruses excreted from human. This study provides valuable information and encouragement to AFP surveillance to maintain high levels of OPV immunization campaigns in the most difficult endemic region of India to interrupt the wild PV transmission.",

The causative role of HBoV in human gastroenteritis remains uncertain, and, to our knowledge, no previous case-control study has studied the relationship between HBoV and gastroenteritis. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study that examined stool samples from 397 children with diarrhea and from 115 asymptomatic control subjects. HBoV was detected using polymerase chain reaction. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the HBoV loads in case and control groups. Common enteric viruses were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, polymerase chain reaction, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: At least 1 viral agent was discovered in 60.2% of cases. HBoV was detected in 14 samples, and 9 were coinfected with either rotavirus (7 of 14 samples) or human calicivirus (2 of 14). Many (8 [57.1%] of 14) of the HBoV infections occurred during September-December 2006. Most (12 [85.7%]) of the HBoV-infected children were 7-18 months of age. The percentage of children with HBoV infection did not differ significantly between case patients and control subjects (3.5% vs. 3.5%), and the statistical analysis did not support a correlation between HBoV infection and more-severe clinical symptoms. The viral load differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P = .09, by log-normal Student's t test). In addition, the VP1/VP2 partial gene of HBoV from case patients and control subjects showed minimal sequence variation. CONCLUSIONS: A single genetic lineage of HBoV was revealed in persons in China. Despite its high prevalence in stool samples, our study does not support a causative role of HBoV in gastroenteritis.",

We conducted a retrospective chart review of Latina patients who delivered at our institution coded with ICP between 2000 and 2007. During this time period it was our practice to offer delivery to patients with ICP at 37 weeks of gestation. Subjects were classified into three groups according to total bile acid (TBA) concentration: < 20 micromol/L (mild ICP), > or = 20 micromol/L and < 40 micromol/L (moderate ICP), and > or = 40 micromol/L (severe ICP). Meconium passage was observed in no births in patients with mild IC, but was found in 18% of deliveries with moderate/severe ICP. The risk of meconium passage increased linearly, with a 19.7% increased risk for each 10 mumol/L increase in TBA concentration ( P = 0.001). There was no association with higher TBA concentration and other adverse outcomes. There was no difference in adverse outcomes between moderate and severe ICP. We concluded that in our Latina population with ICP, an association existed between meconium passage and moderate/severe ICP. Delivering at 37 weeks was associated with a low risk of adverse outcomes due to ICP among all patients, including those with higher TBA concentrations.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised intervention trial in which 82 healthy, full-term, partially breast-fed children, from 1 week to 3 months old, were given 1 of the following formulae: whey-based formula (control group), whey-based formula with galacto- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS group), or whey-based formula with galacto- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides added with pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS group). Children were studied for the duration of the partial formula feeding period and every 2 weeks for 2 months after breast-feeding cessation. The total bacteria count and the proportion of 7 bacterial families were determined using in situ hybridisation coupled to flow cytometry. RESULTS: The total bacterial count did not alter with time or type of feeding (9.9 +/- 0.1 log10 cells per gram wet weight). Compared with the control group, there was an increase of the Bifidobacterium genus (P = 0.0001), and a decrease of proportions for the Bacteroides group (P = 0.02) and the Clostridium coccoides group (P = 0.01) in both oligosaccharide groups. The proportion of bifidobacteria was significantly higher in the scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS compared with the scGOS/lcFOS group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Infant formulae appear to be clinically safe and effective on infant microbiota. They minimize the alteration of faecal microbiota after cessation of breast-feeding and promote bifidobacteria proportions, with a stronger effect when acidic oligosaccharides are present.",

The incidence of pathologic finding, particularly Hirschsprung's disease, contributing to the presence of these plugs, has been debated. However, there are little recent data in the literature. Therefore, we reviewed our experience with meconium plugs as a cause of abdominal distension to evaluate the associated conditions and incidence of Hirschsprung's disease. METHODS: We reviewed the records of newborns with meconium plugs found in the distal colon on contrast enema from 1994 to 2007. Demographics, radiologic findings, histologic findings, operative findings, and clinical courses were reviewed. RESULTS: During the study period, 77 patients were identified. Mean gestational age was 37.4 weeks and birth weight, 2977 g. Hirschsprung's disease was found in 10 patients (13%). One had ultrashort segment disease and another had total colonic aganglionosis. Maternal diabetes was identified in 6 patients. No patients were diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, meconium ileus, malrotation, or intestinal atresia. CONCLUSION: Meconium plugs found on contrast enema are associated with a 13% incidence of Hirschsprung's disease in our experience. Although all patients with plugs and persistent abnormal stooling patterns should prompt a rectal biopsy and genetic probe, the incidence of Hirschsprung's and cystic fibrosis may not be as high as previously reported.",

ONPS is performed to remove lung fluid, meconium, or other secretions from the airway, thereby improving oxygenation and/or preventing aspiration. However, there are controversies regarding this practice, as it seems to be associated with complications. In the presence of clear amniotic fluid, routine ONPS in infants born vaginally and by cesarean section is associated with bradycardia, apnea, and delays in achieving normal oxygen saturations, with no benefit. Intrapartum ONPS and post-natal endotracheal suctioning of vigorous infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) does not prevent meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Although depressed infants born through MSAF are at risk of developing MAS, there is no evidence that endotracheal suctioning of these infants reduces MAS.",

We identified the Cryptosporidium spp. in 199 positive human stool samples by PCR-RFLP of the 18S rRNA and COWP gene loci. Subspecies were identified in 104 samples by sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene fragment. Overall C. parvum was identified in 80%, and C. hominis in 20% of cases. No other Cryptosporidium spp. were detected. C. parvum was by far the most common species in the rural, more sparsely populated west of Ireland and exhibited a pronounced spring peak coincident with a peak in the national cryptosporidiosis incidence rate. Our data indicated a trend towards higher proportions of C. hominis in older age groups. Ninety-nine per cent of all subtyped C. parvum isolates belonged to allele family IIa, of which allele IIaA18G3R1 was by far the most common (63%). According to a recent study by Thompson and colleagues [Parasitology Research (2007), 100, 619-624] this allele is also the most common in Irish cattle. Subtyping of the C. hominis isolates indicated that they belonged to a geographically widely distributed allele (IbA10G2) known to have caused several water- and foodborne outbreaks around the world.

The main aims of this study were to determine if rotavirus can be detected on environmental surfaces in the neonatal nursery and whether the infection occurs in mothers of infected and uninfected neonates. Thirty rotavirus positive neonates and an equal number of negative neonates were enrolled in this study. Stool samples from 15 mothers in each group and environmental swabs collected from the bed and surfaces around neonates were tested for rotavirus using single round and nested PCR for the VP6 gene. Rotavirus could be detected in environmental swabs using single round PCR for VP6 gene in 40% of neonates positive for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and 33.3% of EIA negative neonates. The detection rate was almost 100% using the nested VP6 PCR. Rotavirus was detected in maternal samples only if the nested VP6 PCR was used, with no significant difference between rates of rotavirus detection in maternal fecal samples of infected and uninfected neonates (p-0.4). Sequence analysis of nested VP6 amplicons from two environmental swabs revealed them to be closest in identity to G10P[11], the most common genotype causing infections in neonates in this setting. Interestingly, sequences of amplicons from maternal stool samples did not cluster with G10P[11] or other VP6 subgroup I strains but showed clustering with human strains of VP6 subgroup II.",

In addition, the recombination-prone RdRp-capsid junction region was highly conserved with those of human SaVs of genogroup GI. The presence of porcine viruses similar to human SaVs is a significant finding because of the potential for zoonotic infections or generation of porcine/human recombinants.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to clarify the role of PBV in diarrhea illness in children. METHODS: Between January 1977 and December 2002, 2224 stool specimens were collected from children <3 years old with diarrhea illness. All samples were analyzed by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique (PAGE) for the presence of bisegmented dsRNA virus genomic pattern. Gels were dried and archived. This study procedure allowed us to keep a laboratory electrophoretic record of each sample assayed. In the present study, all the electrophoretic records were reviewed in order to identify PBV positive samples. RESULTS: Two out of 2224 (0.09%) stools were positive for large genome profile of PBV. These two positive samples were collected from hospitalized children <1 year old; one of them presenting rotavirus co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: The findings obtained in the present report support strong evidence that large genome profile PBV can be considered more an occasional viral agent rather than an etiological agent associated with diarrheal illness.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Culture-based methods of monitoring fecal pollution in recreational waters require 24 to 48 hours to obtain results. This delay leads to potentially inaccurate management decisions regarding beach safety. We evaluated the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) as a faster method to assess recreational water quality and predict swimming-associated illnesses. METHODS: We enrolled visitors at 4 freshwater Great Lakes beaches, and contacted them 10 to 12 days later to ask about health symptoms experienced since the visit. Water at the beaches was polluted by point sources that carried treated sewage. We tested water samples daily for Enterococcus using QPCR and membrane filtration (EPA Method 1600). RESULTS: We completed 21,015 interviews and tested 1359 water samples. Enterococcus QPCR cell equivalents (CEs) were positively associated with swimming-associated gastrointestinal (GI) illness (adjusted odds ratio per 1 log10 QPCR CE =1.26; 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.51). The association between GI illness and QPCR CE was stronger among children aged 10 years and below (1.69; 1.24-2.30). Nonenteric illnesses were not consistently associated with Enterococcus QPCR CE exposure, although rash and earache occurred more frequently among swimmers. Enterococcus QPCR CE exposure was more strongly associated with GI illness than Enterococcus measured by membrane filtration. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of the indicator bacteria Enterococci in recreational water using a rapid QPCR method predicted swimming-associated GI illness at freshwater beaches polluted by sewage discharge. Children at 10 years or younger were at greater risk for GI illness following exposure.",

Of the 353 meconium samples analyzed for FAEEs, 159 (45%) contained a total amount of seven FAEEs equal or above 2 nmol/g meconium, the cutoff internationally accepted to differentiate heavy maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy from occasional use or no use at all. No parental sociodemographic differences or maternal features differentiated exposed from unexposed newborns. The prevalence of gestational consumption of ethanol was similar between women using and not using drugs of abuse during pregnancy (45.7% and 44.7% of samples with total FAEEs equal or higher than 2 nmol/g meconium, respectively). Meconium samples from newborns exposed in utero to ethanol, and positive for at least one illicit drug (cocaine, opiates, or cannabis), had total FAEEs and five of nine individual FAEEs statistically higher than the meconium samples that were negative for the most frequently used illicit drugs of abuse. Among the most prevalent FAEEs, oleic acid ethyl ester showed the best correlation to total FAEE concentration followed by palmitoleic acid ethyl ester . This study, which highlights a 45% ethanol consumption during pregnancy in a low socioeconomic status cohort, may serve as an eye opener for Europeans that gestational alcohol exposure is not endemic only in areas outside of Europe.",

Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), products of nonoxidative ethanol metabolism, have been established as a novel biomarker of fetal ethanol exposure. We present the first application of this biomarker to a population-based sample in Canada. Six-hundred eighty-two meconium specimens were anonymously collected in the region of Grey Bruce, Ontario, Canada. Meconium FAEE were extracted by liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection confirmed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. We measured ethyl palmitate (E16:0), ethyl palmitoleate (E16:1), ethyl stearate (E18:0), ethyl oleate (E18:1), ethyl linoleate (E18:2), ethyl linolenate (E18:3), and ethyl arachidonate (E20:4). Seventeen of 682 meconium samples tested positive for significant prenatal ethanol exposure (>2.0 nmol/g). FAEE analysis detected fivefold more ethanol-exposed pregnancies than standard postpartum questionnaires in this population (2.5% versus 0.5%) (P < 0.001). The prevalence of ethanol-exposed pregnancies was consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates of \"frequent\" prenatal drinking and previously published estimates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder disease prevalence in the general North American population. The FAEE concentrations of negative (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.49 nmol/g) versus positive (95% confidence interval, 7.74-151.28 nmol/g) samples were distinct, further demonstrating the specificity of this biomarker in determining significant prenatal ethanol exposure. Meconium FAEE analysis demonstrates a fivefold increase in sensitivity over currently used methods of self-report-based screening in Ontario for the detection of ethanol-exposed pregnancies in a clinical setting.",

Children with these infections suffer from developmental impairments and other serious illnesses. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of geohelminth infection, infection intensity as well as the change in the intensity in children from Western Nepal over years. METHODS: This 6-year hospital based prospective study at the Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara included children (< 15 years) visiting the hospital from Kaski and 7 surrounding districts. Samples were also collected from children in the community from different medical camps. Three stool samples from every child were processed using direct and concentration methods. The Kato-Katz technique was used for measuring the intensity of infection. RESULTS: The overall prevalence in hospital - attending children was 9.2% with 7.6% in preschool (0 - 5 y) and 11.0% in school-age (6 - 15 y) children, and in community 17.7% with 14.8% in pre-school and 20.5% in school-age children. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Ancylostoma deodenale and Strongyloides stercoralis were the common geohelminths with a gradual decrease in worm load over the years. School-age children were found to be significantly more prone to geohelminth infection as compared to preschool children, but no statistical difference was detected by gender, district as well as season. CONCLUSION: This heavy infection of geohelminths in children should be corrected by appropriate medication and maintaining strict personal hygiene. Health education, clean water, good sewage management and a congenial environment should be ensured to minimise infection.",

Tracheal smooth muscle reactivity to histamine and acetylcholine (10(-5)-10(-3) mol/l) was highest with the highest meconium concentration. In contrast, lung tissue reactivity tended to decrease with increasing meconium concentration.

We evaluated the meconium effect on lung vascular and airway muscle. Three-days old and adult rat 3rd-4th generation arteries and adjacent bronchi were studied in vitro. Fresh homogenized meconium did not induce arterial or airway muscle contraction. In precontracted arteries, meconium induced muscle relaxation that was greater (p < 0.01) in the newborn (53 +/- 5%), when compared with adult vessels (34 +/- 3%). This relaxant response was partially abrogated (p < 0.01) by L-NAME (28 +/- 4%) and enhanced by a superoxide scavenger (55 +/- 4%). Precontracted bronchial muscle relaxed to meconium in vitro and the magnitude of response was greater in the adult when compared with the newborn (p < 0.01). In vitro incubation with meconium (3 h) reduced agonist-stimulated force and enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation (p < 0.01). Airway meconium instillation followed by mechanical ventilation enhanced thromboxane-induced newborn rat pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in vitro (p < 0.01). We conclude that meconium is a pulmonary vasodilator in vitro Meconium is first noted to be present at 12 wk gestation in humans. It is the by-product of fetal amniotic fluid, lanugo, skin cells, and vernix caseosa swallowing, as well it contains cells derived from the gastrointestinal tract ().

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Information on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens is scarce in resource-poor settings. We determined the susceptibility of bacterial enteric pathogens and faecal Escherichia coli isolates obtained from children in urban Tamale, Northern Ghana, to antibiotics widely used in the that area [ampicillin or amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) and chloramphenicol] and to alternative drugs. METHODS: Five Shigella spp., 6 Salmonella spp. and 318 E. coli were isolated from stool specimens obtained from 367 children with or without acute diarrhoea. Isolates were differentiated using standard laboratory procedures and tested using a breakpoint microbroth dilution method for their susceptibility to 18 antimicrobials and by disc diffusion for their susceptibility to chloramphenicol. RESULTS: Although the salmonellae showed an acceptable resistance pattern, E. coli isolates and the closely related shigellae were highly resistant. About 91% and 81% of E. coli isolates from patients or controls, respectively, were resistant to ampicillin (MICs > or = 8 mg/L), 88% and 76% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (MICs > or = 80/4 mg/L) and 46% and 41% to chloramphenicol (inhibition zones < or = 12 mm). Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics or chloramphenicol was observed more frequently among isolates obtained from infants when compared with older children (1-4 years of age). CONCLUSIONS: Enteric bacteria from children in urban Northern Ghana are highly resistant to antibiotics used in that area. Therefore, new antibiotics should be introduced for the treatment of infections caused by these bacteria. Additionally, the establishment of a surveillance of the prevalence of the main bacterial infectious agents and their antimicrobial resistance is desirable.",

Detection by nucleic acid amplification methods improves patient management. OBJECTIVE: Development of a real-time PCR assay on a LightCycler for simultaneous detection of EV, HPeV and an internal control to monitor inhibition. STUDY DESIGN: We investigated the value of the new assay, prospectively, in a variety of samples from patients suspected of having viral meningitis or sepsis-like syndrome. RESULTS: The assay detected 64 EV serotypes and HPeV types 1-4. Of 186 patients, 63 (33.9%) were EV positive and 18 (9.7%) HPeV positive in one or more samples. In 43 of 159 feces and 6 of 57 throat samples viral culture and PCR were positive. With real-time PCR 27 extra EV and 19 HPeV positives were found. Blood and CSF were present from 33 patients. In 19 patients blood and CSF were positive, one was only positive in CSF, two were only positive in blood, 11 were negative. From 96 patients CSF and/or blood samples were tested and compared to results in throat and/or feces samples. Forty patients were EV-PCR and 14 HPeV-PCR positive in blood and/or CSF. All of these were confirmed by a positive PCR for the respective virus in feces and/or throat. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous detection of EV and HPeV with this two-step real-time PCR is specific, faster and more sensitive than viral culture. All systemic infections (blood or CSF positive) were confirmed in feces. Culture is no longer necessary for clinical diagnosis and should only be performed on PCR-positive samples to obtain isolates for typing purposes. Application of this assay is an important improvement for patient management since the outcome of the analysis is available within the time frame of clinical decision-making.",

OBJECTIVE: We wanted to establish whether early gut microbiota composition can guide weight development throughout early childhood. DESIGN: Overweight and obese children (n = 25) were selected from a prospective follow-up study at the age of 7 y and identified according to the International Obesity Task Force criteria. Normal-weight children (n = 24) were selected from the same cohort and matched for gestational age and body mass index at birth, mode of delivery, probiotic supplementation, duration of breastfeeding, use of antibiotics during infancy, and frequencies of atopic diseases and atopic sensitization. Early fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with microscopic and flow cytometry detection and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: The bifidobacterial numbers in fecal samples during infancy, as assessed by the FISH with flow cytometry, were higher in children remaining normal weight, [median: 2.19 x 10(9) cells/g (interquartile range: 1.10-5.28 x 10(9) cells/g)] than in children becoming overweight [1.20 x 10(9) cells/g (0.48-1.59x 10(9) cells/g); P = 0.02]. A similar tendency was found by FISH with microscopic detection and qRT-PCR. The microbiota aberrancy during infancy in children becoming overweight was also associated with a greater number of Staphylococcus aureus [0.64 x 10(6) cells/g (0.33-1.00 x 10(6) cells/g)] than in children remaining normal weight [0.27 x 10(6) cells/g (0.17-0.50 x 10(6) cells/g); P = 0.013].

Although the etiology remains unknown, infectious agents could play a key role. The aim of this analysis was to examine the role of human astrovirus (HAstV) in infants with NEC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients admitted during a 5-year period at a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit with NEC (Bell stage I-III) who had examination of stool specimens for bacterial and for viral infections were included. Clinical data were reviewed and compared between infants with NEC and astrovirus detection (NEC + HAstV) and infants with NEC without astrovirus detection (NEC - HAstV) in stool specimens. RESULTS: Forty infants with NEC were identified between 2002 and 2006 and 8 patients were excluded from statistical evaluation because of incomplete viral examinations. HAstV was detected in stool specimens of 6 (19%) of the remaining 32 patients with NEC. Double infection with rotavirus was identified in 1 patient. No other viruses were detected. Significant differences in patients with NEC - HAstV and NEC + HAstV were only shown for age at onset of illness (P < 0.001) but not for severity of illness, need for surgical intervention, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that HAstV may be associated with the development of NEC in a subgroup of patients and provides further evidence for the important role of gastrointestinal viral infections in this most common gastrointestinal emergency in premature infants. HAstV should be included in microbiological examination of stool specimens in patients with NEC.",

			"abstract": "This report presents an overview of human enteroviruses in Yunnan Province, the People's Republic of China. A total of 210 non-polioviruses isolated under acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance during a total study period of 5 years--1997 to 2000 and 2004--were examined. Of the 210 non-poliovirus isolates, 12 adenoviruses were serologically identified, and the remaining 198 isolates were used for molecular typing. The viral genomes of 195 non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) on VP1 partial region of virus capsid were translated to the corresponding amino acid sequences; these were compared with those of prototype strains. Based on molecular typing, 5 isolates were classified into 5 serotypes of the human enterovirus A species, 158 isolates, into 35 serotypes of the human enterovirus B species; and 32 isolates, into 6 serotypes of the human enterovirus C species. Viruses belonging to the human enterovirus D species were not isolated. Thus, under AFP surveillance, the human enterovirus B species accounted for 75.2% of the 210 isolates, and it was considered the predominant species. This was followed by human enterovirus C (12.2%), adenovirus (5.7%), and human enterovirus A (2.4%). Further, molecular analysis suggested that several serotypes of human enteroviruses B and C that exhibited genetic polymorphism were indigenous. Molecular typing methods may aid in understanding the epidemiology of NPEVs in Yunnan Province.",

			"abstract": "Between September 2004 and December 2005 a prospective study was conducted to understand the epidemiology of rotavirus infection among children with diarrhea attending two hospitals in Ankara, Turkey. Rotavirus was detected in 39.7% of the 322 stool samples and affected mainly children in the age group of 6-23 months. More than 70% and 39% of these cases occurred in children <2 and <1 year of age, respectively. In the temperate climate of Ankara rotavirus infection was prevalent throughout the year. Serotype G1P[8] was dominant followed by G9P[8]. In 38 samples a total of 5 electropherotypes were detected. All G9P[8] were of long electropherotype except one of short electropherotype. A proportion of G1 and G9 strains were in combination with P[6], P[4] or P nontypable. Mixed serotypes were responsible for 2.4% of the infections. A phylogenetic tree constructed with the deduced amino acid sequences of the VP7 gene showed that 16 Turkish G9 strains clustered with rotaviruses of lineage III. One G9 strain formed a new lineage, lineage IV with the Sri Lankan G9 rotaviruses. In the phylogenetic tree of the VP8* gene, the Turkish G9P[6] rotaviruses clustered with human strains of lineage Ia. Increased diversity of the G/P type combination and the presence of infection throughout the year in Turkey was a situation similar to developing countries. The occurrence of rotavirus infection at later age and low level of mixed infections in Turkey represented the situation of developed countries. This study suggests that diverse G9 rotaviruses are emerging in Turkey.",

E. coli isolates were tested by colony blot hybridization with specific DNA probes designed to detect EPEC, ETEC, EIEC, EAEC, DAEC and EHEC/STEC. Diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains were detected as the sole pathogen in stools of 92 (30.3 %) children, including 72 (33.0 %) with diarrhoea and 20 (23.2 %) without diarrhoea. DAEC was the most frequent pathotype and was found significantly more often from patients (18.3 %) than from controls (8.1 %) (P<0.05), particularly among children more than 1 year of age (P=0.01). Atypical EPEC and EAEC isolates were isolated from both patients (5.5 % and 4.6 %, respectively) and controls (6.9 % and 6.9 %, respectively). ETEC was more frequently isolated from patients (3.2 %) than controls (1.2 %). Typical EPEC (0.9 %) and EIEC (0.4 %) isolates were detected only in children with diarrhoea. In conclusion, our data suggest that DAEC should be considered potential pathogens in the region of Brazil studied.",

A total of 457 stool specimens from children hospitalized with acute diarrhea and 566 stool specimens from adults and children involved in 110 gastroenteritis outbreaks were screened for the presence of Aichi virus by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of the genomic region of the 3C and 3D (3CD) nonstructural proteins. Our results show a low incidence of Aichi virus in pediatric samples and the existence of mixed infections with other microbiological agents in some cases. From the outbreak survey, it appears that the presence of Aichi virus is an indicator of mixed infections causing gastroenteritis outbreaks and that it could be involved in half of the oyster-associated outbreaks. A second RT-PCR was developed to amplify a part of the VP1 gene. The phylogenetic analysis showed a good correlation between the two classifications based on 3CD and VP1 gene sequences and revealed the prevalence of genotype A in France. It also allowed us to partially describe an Aichi virus strain that could represent a new genotype, thus suggesting the existence of a certain diversity.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Thimerosal is a mercurial preservative that was widely used in multidose vaccine vials in the United States and Europe until 2001 and continues to be used in many countries throughout the world. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study to assess blood levels and elimination of ethyl mercury after vaccination of infants with thimerosal-containing vaccines. METHODS: Blood, stool, and urine samples were obtained before vaccination and 12 hours to 30 days after vaccination from 216 healthy children: 72 newborns (group 1), 72 infants aged 2 months (group 2), and 72 infants aged 6 months (group 3). Total mercury levels were measured by atomic absorption. Blood mercury pharmacokinetics were calculated by pooling the data on the group and were based on a 1-compartment first-order pharmacokinetics model. RESULTS: For groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, (1) mean +/- SD weights were 3.4 +/- 0.4, 5.1 +/- 0.6, and 7.7 +/- 1.1 kg; (2) maximal mean +/- SD blood mercury levels were 5.0 +/- 1.3, 3.6 +/- 1.5, and 2.8 +/- 0.9 ng/mL occurring at 0.5 to 1 day after vaccination; (3) maximal mean +/- SD stool mercury levels were 19.1 +/- 11.8, 37.0 +/- 27.4, and 44.3 +/- 23.9 ng/g occurring on day 5 after vaccination for all groups; and (4) urine mercury levels were mostly nondetectable. The blood mercury half-life was calculated to be 3.7 days and returned to prevaccination levels by day 30. CONCLUSIONS: The blood half-life of intramuscular ethyl mercury from thimerosal in vaccines in infants is substantially shorter than that of oral methyl mercury in adults. Increased mercury levels were detected in stools after vaccination, suggesting that the gastrointestinal tract is involved in ethyl mercury elimination. Because of the differing pharmacokinetics of ethyl and methyl mercury, exposure guidelines based on oral methyl mercury in adults may not be accurate for risk assessments in children who receive thimerosal-containing vaccines.",

Although fecal fat excretion slightly decreased and achievement of full enteral feeding was earlier in the UDCA group, these differences were not significant. Interestingly, whereas serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity increased during the parenteral nutrition period in the placebo group, we observed a constant and significant decrease in the UDCA group. This observation warrants further investigation to determine the utility of prophylactic UDCA in preventing cholestasis in infants with prolonged parenteral nutrition.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation on the immunological composition of breast milk in relation to sensitization and eczema in the babies. Total IgA, secretory IgA (SIgA), TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, IL-10, TNF, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and Na/K ratios were analyzed in colostrum and mature milk obtained from women treated with L. reuteri (n = 54) or placebo (n = 55) from gestational week 36 until delivery. Bacteriological analyses of L. reuteri were performed in faecal samples of the mothers. The infants were followed prospectively for 2 yr regarding development of eczema and sensitization as defined by a positive skin prick test and/or circulating allergen-specific IgE antibodies at 6, 12, and 24 months of age. Supplementation of L. reuteri during pregnancy was associated with low levels of TGF-beta2 and slightly increased levels of IL-10 in colostrum. For TGF-beta2, this association was most pronounced in mothers with detectable L. reuteri in faeces. Infants receiving breast milk with low levels of TGF-beta2 were less likely to become sensitized during their first 2 yr of life. A similar trend was observed for development of IgE-associated eczema. The levels of total IgA, SIgA, TGF-beta1, TNF, sCD14, and Na/K ratios in breast milk were not affected by the intake of L. reuteri. None of these parameters correlated with sensitization or development of eczema in the infant, except for high Na/K ratios that associated with increased risk of sensitization. Supplementation with L. reuteri during late pregnancy reduces breast milk levels of TGF-beta2, and low levels of this cytokine are associated with less sensitization and possibly less IgE-associated eczema in breast-fed infants.",

Probiotic exposure exerted microbiome modification and resulted in altered hepatic lipid metabolism coupled with lowered plasma lipoprotein levels and apparent stimulated glycolysis. Probiotic treatments also altered a diverse range of pathways outcomes, including amino-acid metabolism, methylamines and SCFAs. The novel application of hierarchical-principal component analysis allowed visualization of multicompartmental transgenomic metabolic interactions that could also be resolved at the compartment and pathway level.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Different groups of viruses have been shown to be responsible for acute diarrhea among children during their first few years of life. Epidemiological knowledge of viral agents is critical for the development of effective preventive measures, including vaccines. METHODS: In this study we determined the prevalence of the four major enteropathogenic viruses - rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus - was determined in 270 stool samples collected from children aged 0 - 60 months who were admitted with diarrhea in four hospitals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, using commercially available ELISA kits. In addition, the molecular epidemiology of group A rotavirus was investigated using reverse transcriptase multiplex polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: At least one viral agent was detected in 87/270 (32.2%) of the children. The prevalence of rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus was 18.1%, 13.7%, 2.6% and 0.4%, respectively. In most cases (62.1%) of viruses were detected in children aged 7-12 months. The G and P types (VP7 and VP4 genotypes respectively) were further investigated in 49 rotavirus ELISA positive samples. G9 was the predominant G type (81.6%), followed by G1 (10.2%) and G3 (0.2%). P[8] was the predominant P type (83.7%), followed by P[6] (0.4%) and P[4] (0.2%). The following G and P types were not detected in this study population; G2, G4, G8 G10, P[9], P[10] and P[11]. The dominating G/P combination was G9P[8], accounting for 39 (90.7%) of the 43 fully characterized strains. Three (6.1%) of the 49 rotavirus strains could not be typed. CONCLUSION: Nearly one third of children with diarrhea admitted to hospitals in Dar es Salaam had one of the four viral agents. The predominance of rotavirus serotype G9 may have implication for rotavirus vaccination in Tanzania.",

Further, between May and June 2005, gastroenteritis outbreaks or sporadic cases of gastroenteritis were reported in two other municipalities, Pirai and Rio Claro, also located in the Middle Paraiba Valley. From March to June 2005, 50 fecal samples were collected in this region and those samples were tested for the presence of bacteria and other parasites and were demonstrated to be negative. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an enzyme immunoassay were performed for adenovirus and rotavirus detection and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to investigate the presence of norovirus (NoV) and astrovirus. In addition, a quantitative TaqMan real time PCR for NoV was performed for quantification of viral DNA in order to compare the results with those obtained by conventional RT-PCR. NoV was detected in 33 out of 50 (66%) samples, and a 100% correlation between both methodologies was obtained. These results are demonstrating that NoV was the etiological agent responsible for those acute gastroenteritis cases. Partial nucleotide sequence analysis of the capsid gene revealed that the circulating strain was NoV GII/4 confirming the worldwide distribution of this genotype. The results highlight the role of NoV as a main viral agent responsible for gastroenteritis cases in children and adults both in outbreaks as well as in sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis.",

			"abstract": "Stool samples were collected from infants nursed in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in East London, United Kingdom. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for the carriage of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae strains (MRE; resistant to three or more classes of antibiotic) and the extent of the persistence of resistant strains following discharge. Sixty-two (50%) of 124 infants had acquired MRE by 2 weeks of postnatal age, and 69 (56%) infants had acquired MRE by discharge. The proportions of infants at 2 weeks carrying strains that were resistant to antibiotics were the following: tetracycline, 79%; amoxicillin, 78%; cephalosporins, 31%; trimethoprim, 20%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 11%; chloramphenicol, 9%; and aminoglycoside, 4%. A gestational age of less than 26 weeks was a risk factor for colonization with MRE at discharge, but not at 2 weeks. Analysis within a NICU showed that exposure of an infant to a specific antibiotic in the NICU was not a risk factor for the carriage of a strain resistant to that antibiotic. Estimates of persistence from discharge to 6 months were the following: for tetracycline, 57% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.35 to 0.87); chloramphenicol, 49% (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.83); trimethoprim, 45% (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.74); piperacillin-tazobactam, 42% (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.71); and augmentin, 34% (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.66). Strains resistant to cephalosporins or aminoglycosides showed lower levels of persistence. Nine of 34 infants (26.5%) with Escherichia coli and 4 (7.1%) of 56 infants with Klebsiella spp. at discharge carried strains indistinguishable by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and antibiotic susceptibility patterns at 6 months. MRE were found at high frequency in the infants during their stay in the NICU and persisted in a proportion of infants.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: It might be that early intestinal colonization by bacteria in westernized infants fails to give rise to sufficient immune stimulation to support maturation of regulatory immune mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to characterize the very early infantile microbiota by using a culture-independent approach and to relate the colonization pattern to development of atopic eczema in the first 18 months of life. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 35 infants at 1 week of age. Twenty infants were healthy, and 15 infants were given diagnoses of atopic eczema at the age of 18 months. The fecal microbiota of the infants was compared by means of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) analysis of amplified 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: By means of T-RFLP analysis, the median number of peaks, Shannon-Wiener index, and Simpson index of diversity were significantly less for infants with atopic eczema than for infants remaining healthy in the whole group and for the Swedish infants when AluI was used for digestion. The same was found when TTGE patterns were compared. In addition, TTGE analysis showed significantly less bands and lower diversity indices for the British atopic infants compared with those of the control subjects. CONCLUSION: There is a reduced diversity in the early fecal microbiota of infants with atopic eczema during the first 18 months of life.",

With the development of neonatal care, the prognosis of meconium peritonitis improved much. We report our clinical experience. METHODS: The medical records of patients with meconium peritonitis admitted to the Asan Medical Center from June 1989 to July 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Of 41 patients (17 males, 24 females), 38 (92.7%) were suspected to suffer from meconium peritonitis prenatally, at a median gestational age of 32 weeks (range, 21-40 weeks). The most common prenatal sonographic finding was fetal ascites followed by dilated bowel. Ten patients were managed conservatively, but 31 patients underwent operations including resection and anastomosis (22), drainage procedure (4), ileostomy (3) and primary repair (2). The operative 31 cases comprised generalized (16), fibroadhesive (10), and cystic types (5). The main causes were intestinal atresia and idiopathic bowel perforation. The mortality rate was 2.4%, and the morbidity rate was 34.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Good survival rate was achieved. But there was rather high morbidity. More gentle and delicate approach should be done to lower the morbidity.",

METHODS: The concentrations of individual bile acids were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after solvolysis and hydrolysis of bile acid conjugates. RESULTS: In meconium, the main bile acids were chenodeoxycholic and hyocholic acids. The main bile acid of feces from preterm infants at 6 days of age was the same as that of meconium. We also detected large amounts of secondary bile acids, especially deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. The ratio of cholic acid relative to chenodeoxycholic acid in meconium of preterm and full-term infants and in feces of preterm infants was less than 1, 0.36, 0.55, and 0.55, respectively. The percentage of chenodeoxycholic acid relative to total bile acids in meconium of preterm (P < 0.05) and full-term (P < 0.01) infants was significantly higher than that in feces of 6-day-old full-term infants. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the main pathway, at least, for bile acid synthesis in preterm infants may be the acidic pathway until the infants reach about 7 days of age.",

Limited data exist on the epidemiology of rotavirus disease among Indonesian children. OBJECTIVES: We describe the epidemiology of rotavirus-associated diarrhea among Indonesian children <6 years of age, including clinical symptoms and genotypes. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a hospital-based, case series study at four referral hospitals between February 2004 and February 2005 among children with diarrhea. Rotavirus positivity was defined by a positive result from either EIA or RT-PCR. A semi-nested RT-PCR was used to determine specific rotavirus genotypes. RESULTS: 1660 stools were tested for pathogens. The overall rotavirus prevalence was 45.5%. Children with rotavirus-associated diarrhea were significantly younger (p<0.0001) and more likely to be hospitalized (81.3% versus 72.2%; p<0.0001). Symptoms associated with rotavirus included, vomiting, fever, nausea, fatigue and dehydration, while bloody stool was significantly less common with rotavirus-associated diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus was an important contributor of morbidity to our study sample. Rotavirus genotyping demonstrated a temporal shift from G1-G4 to G9, but this was highly associated with the P[8] gene, suggesting that a multivalent rotavirus vaccine, incorporating G9 P[8] antigen, may reduce the burden of diarrheal illnesses among Indonesian children.",

A total of 126 human Lactobacillus isolates was investigated. Eighteen isolates significantly inhibited the growth of C. albicans on agar. The LCF of one of these strains showed strong inhibition of both C. albicans and C. glabrata. This strain was genetically identified as Lactobacillus fermentum and designated L. fermentum Ess-1.

Clara cell protein (CC10) is a novel anti-inflammatory agent that can also inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (an important component of meconium). The present study examined whether administration of recombinant human CC10 (rhCC10) would reduce inflammation and improve lung function in a piglet model of MAS. Following meconium instillation, piglets exhibited significant physiologic dysfunction that improved significantly after surfactant administration. Analysis of tracheal aspirates revealed significant increases in both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 after meconium instillation. rhCC10-treated animals had significantly lower TNF-alpha levels at 24 h (561 +/- 321 versus 1357 +/- 675 pg/mL, p < 0.05) compared with saline controls. There were no differences between rhCC10-treated and untreated groups with respect to other measured physiologic variables or inflammatory markers, including secretory PLA2 activity. Histologic analyses revealed marked inflammatory infiltrates and thickened alveolar walls, but no significant differences among rhCC10 and control animals. Newborn piglets with MAS have significant physiologic dysfunction, marked inflammatory changes and histologic abnormalities, which was partially counteracted by a single dose of exogenous surfactant and rhCC10.",

Ethnicity was not associated with cannabis use, nor were the maternal features or newborns somatometry. A significantly higher percentage of cannabis using mothers had a managerial professional job versus nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Meconium analysis is especially important to identify neonates who have been exposed to cannabis in utero, which appear normal at birth and therefore may not be recognized. Timely detection of these newborns at risk provides the basis for appropriate treatment and adequate medical and social follow-up.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between maternal breast-milk and fecal bifidobacteria and infants' fecal bifidobacteria. METHODS: Sixty-one mother-infant pairs were included, special emphasis being placed on the maternal allergic status. Bifidobacteria were analysed by a direct PCR method in fecal samples from mothers at 30-35 weeks of gestation and from infants at 1 month of age and from breast-milk samples 1 month post-partum. RESULTS: Fecal Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium bifidum colonization frequencies and counts among mother-infant pairs correlated significantly (P=0.005 and 0.02 for frequencies, respectively, and P=0.002 and 0.01 for counts, respectively). Only infants of allergic, atopic mothers were colonized with B. adolescentis. Each of the breast-milk samples contained bifidobacteria [median 1.4 x 10(3) bacterial cells/mL; interquartile range (IQR) 48.7-3.8 x 10(3)]. Bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently detected species in breast-milk. Allergic mothers had significantly lower amounts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk compared with non-allergic mothers [median 1.3 x 10(3) bacterial cells/mL (IQR 22.4-3.0 x 10(3)) vs. 5.6 x 10(3) bacterial cells/mL (1.8 x 10(3)-1.8 x 10(4)), respectively, (P=0.004)], and their infants had concurrently lower counts of bifidobacteria in feces [3.9 x 10(8) bacterial cells/g (IQR 6.5 x 10(6)-1.5 x 10(9)) in infants of allergic mothers, vs. 2.5 x 10(9) bacterial cells/g (6.5 x 10(8)-3.2 x 10(10)) in infants of non-allergic mothers, P=0.013]. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-milk contains significant numbers of bifidobacteria and the maternal allergic status further deranges the counts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk. Maternal fecal and breast-milk bifidobacterial counts impacted on the infants' fecal Bifidobacterium levels. Breast-milk bacteria should thus be considered an important source of bacteria in the establishment of infantile intestinal microbiota.",

Furthermore, G. lamblia infection was detected in 15 (6.6%) of 228 faecal samples submitted to the laboratory for bacterial culture only. C. parvum/C. hominis infections were not diagnosed by routine procedures, but DNA from these organisms was detected in 4.3% of 950 DNA samples. A strong association with age was noted, with Cryptosporidium being detected in 21.8% of 110 children aged <5 years. C. hominis was the most prevalent species. E. histolytica was not detected in this study population. Analysis of microscopy data revealed that the number of additional parasites missed by PCR was small.

METHODS: Cryptosporidium inter-household transmission was studied by comparing the frequency of anti-Cryptosporidium IgG antibodies among people inhabiting areas with or without different environmental sanitation measures and intra-household transmission by comparing the presence of these antibodies in families with or without cases of diarrhoea, associated with the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in their stools. Children or family members with diarrhoeal episodes were evaluated parasitologically for Cryptosporidium infection by testing stool specimens with the Ritchie-modified formol-ether concentration and the acid-fast staining methods. All groups were serologically evaluated for parasite exposure by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was detected in the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection between area 1 which had no environmental sanitation measures and area 3 which had improved environmental sanitation measures (P = 0.044). Most of the hygienic habits investigated did not correlate with the presence of anti-Cryptosporidium antibody in sera of the population studied. However, positive associations were found between both poor household water supply (OD = 0.17; 90% CI = 0.09-0.32; P = 0.0001) and drinking unboiled/unfiltered water (OD = 0.40; 90% CI = 0.24-0.67; P = 0.0002) with high levels of anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies in sera. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that although uncorrected household water supply, storage and handling play an important role on Cryptosporidium transmission in periurban areas of developing country cities, like Salvador, Brazil, inadequate environmental conditions may also contribute to the spread of this parasite.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: After reports of emerging outbreaks in Canada and the United States, Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) due to polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027 was detected in 2 medium-to-large hospitals in The Netherlands in 2005. METHODS: National surveillance was initiated to investigate the spread and the epidemiology of CDAD. Microbiologists were asked to send strains recovered from patients with a severe course of CDAD or recovered when an increased incidence of CDAD was noted. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect demographic, clinical, and epidemiological patient data. Strains were characterized by polymerase chain reaction ribotyping, toxinotyping, the presence of toxin genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: During the period from February 2005 through November 2006, 1175 stool samples from 863 patients were sent from 50 health care facilities. Of these patients, 218 (25.3%) had CDAD due to ribotype 027, and 645 patients (74.7%) had CDAD due to other ribotypes, mainly 001 (17.8%) and 014 (7.2%). Polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027 was more frequently present in general hospitals than in academic hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 4.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-12.0). Outbreaks of CDAD were observed in 10 hospitals and in 1 nursing home. Patients infected with ribotype 027 were significantly older (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.43-3.33), and significantly more patients used fluoroquinolones (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.01-8.20), compared with those who were infected with other ribotypes. Clear trends were observed for more severe diarrhea (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 0.83-4.73), higher attributable mortality (6.3% vs. 1.2%; OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 0.41-26.4), and more recurrences (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.94-2.20). CONCLUSIONS: Ribotype 027 was found in 20 (18.3%) of 109 hospitals in The Netherlands, with a geographic concentration in the western and central parts of the country. The clinical syndrome in patients with CDAD differed on the basis of ribotype. Thus, early recognition of the ribotype has benefits.",

In this study the incidence of diarrhea was assessed in 877 hospitalized children under five years old, over a period of 24 months and distributed in 470 cases of diarrhea and 407 age-matched group with other pathologies, as control group. Two antigen detection techniques based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and latex particles were used for detection of rotavirus and adenovirus. Rotavirus A was a major cause of gastroenteritis with 23.6% of cases, being 90% of these cases in young children. Adenovirus infections was detected by EIA with frequency of 6.4%. Rotavirus and adenovirus were detected in 10.1 and 1.7% of stools from control group, respectively. Interestingly, the frequency of the youngest children in the control group excreting Rotavirus A was comparable to that detected in stools from diarrheic children. We cannot rule out the existence of other enteric viruses because the etiology of 171 cases of diarrhea was not determined and active search for astrovirus and calicivirus was not done. This is the first study that shows the presence of enteric viruses in the infantile population from Western Brazilian Amazonia and it was important to help physicians in the treatment of viral gastroenteritis.",

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether surfactant replacement could restore the terminal airspaces in the lungs that had been distended after meconium aspiration. METHODS: Meconium aspiration was induced by injecting meconium (50 mg x kg(-1)) into the airways of adult rats anesthetized with pentobarbital and ventilated with pressure-preset mode. The animals were further ventilated with or without surfactant replacement (100 mg x kg(-1)), and the sizes of the terminal airspaces were determined after fixing the lungs at an airway pressure of 10 cm H2O on deflation. RESULTS: Approximately 75 min after aspiration (early analysis point), alveolar ducts were widened and the mean ratio of the largest terminal airspace size class (> or =63,000 microm(2)) was 38.7% (n = 7), which was significantly higher than that of controls (6%, n = 7). Three hours after the early analysis point, the ratio increased to 50.2% (n = 7, p < 0.05), but surfactant replacement reversed the ratio to 18.8% (n = 7, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In rats with meconium aspiration, surfactant replacement restored the distended terminal airspaces of the lungs and kept the spaces from irregular overdistension.",

The self-reported maternal smoking status during pregnancy was determined by means of a questionnaire and verified by measurements in urine prior to childbirth. The total sum of nicotine and its metabolites (Sum(tot)) of the first passed meconium samples was 1560 +/- 1024 pmol/g in newborns of smoking mothers. Smoking of less than five cigarettes was clearly detected. Sum(tot) remained constant in all meconium samples passed by a neonate in succession. However, the proportion of nicotine decreased with the time of passage after birth and the OH-cotinine proportion increased, whereas cotinine hardly changed. Nicotine or its metabolites were not detectable in meconium (detection limit < 20 pmol/g), when the mothers were only exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) using the HPLC method. The hypothesis that the content of nicotine metabolites in meconium reflects long-term smoke exposure could not be confirmed in newborns whose mothers had quit smoking during the latter half of pregnancy. Determining Sum(tot) enables the intensity of continuous smoking during pregnancy to be estimated in all meconium samples passed by a newborn.",

Stool specimens and clinical information were collected from 111 pairs of children with diarrhoea and healthy controls. A total of 73 cases (66 %) and 41 controls (36 %) had an enteric pathogen. The pathogens most often associated with diarrhoea were rotavirus (17 % of cases) and Entamoeba histolytica (15 %), followed by Shigella (5 %). Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) was found in 23 % of both patients and controls. Characterization of DEC by serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility test and PFGE showed that DEC represented by different pathotypes belonged to various serotypes. Except for three enterotoxigenic E. coli strains, typing by PFGE revealed no correlation between pathotype and serotype of DEC strains. This suggests a high prevalence of a variety of DEC subtypes in this area. For this particular region, vaccine development strategies targeting rotavirus and Shigella are likely to be of public health benefit, whereas the role of DEC and preventive measures need to be further elaborated.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the relationship between prenatal pesticide exposures and the generation of leukemia-associated t(8;21)(q22;q22), one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PROCEDURE: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to quantitatively detect different pesticides (propoxur and cypermethrin) in meconium from 49 newborn babies from the Philippines. The generation of t(8;21) was determined in the corresponding umbilical cord blood samples by detection of the AML1-ETO fusion transcripts derived from t(8;21) using nested RT-PCR. Levels for the AML1-ETO fusion transcripts were quantitated by real-time RT-PCR in the t(8;21) positive cord blood samples. AML1-ETO fusion transcript forms were characterized by RT-PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In the present study using umbilical cord blood samples obtained from infants whose prenatal exposure to the pesticide, propoxur, was determined by meconium analysis, we showed that (i) incidence of t(8;21) in the exposed group was two-fold higher than that in the unexposed group; and (ii) the levels for AML1-ETO fusion transcripts resulting from t(8;21) positively correlated with propoxur concentrations in meconium. Similar heterogeneity in the fusion transcripts was detected in the t(8;21) positive cord blood samples as in our previous study with t(8;21) AML patients. CONCLUSION: These results further confirm the prenatal origin of t(8;21) and establish a significant correlation between prenatal pesticide exposures and the generation of t(8;21). They suggest that prenatal pesticide exposures may be causal factors for the generation of leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations.",

			"abstract": "Most studies of opportunistic infections focus on those with weak immune systems, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS patients and children. However, there is a lack of information on these infectious agents in healthy people worldwide. In the present study, stool samples from both HIV patients and healthy people were examined to begin filling in this serious gap in the understanding of human microsporidiosis, particularly the enteric parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Specimens were obtained from 191 individuals living in Yaounde, the capital city of Cameroon, in sub-Sahara Africa, including 28 HIV-positive patients who also had tuberculosis (TB). E. bieneusi prevalence was 35.7% among the HIV(+) TB patients, whereas it was only 24.0% among 25 HIV(-) TB patients in the same hospital. Unexpectedly, the prevalence (67.5%) of microsporidiosis was found to be even higher for 126 immunocompetent individuals than for those with TB (healthy people compared to HIV(+) TB and HIV(-) TB patients; P < 0.001). The immunocompetent group included people ranging from 2 to 70 years of age living in four different neighborhoods in Yaounde. The highest prevalence (81.5%) was among teenagers, and the highest mean infection score (+2.5) was among children. Additional studies of immunocompetent people in other parts of Cameroon, as well as in other countries, are needed to better understand microsporidiosis epidemiology. There is still much more to be learned about the natural history of microsporidia, the pathogenicity of different strains, and the role of enteric microsporidia as opportunistic infections in immunodeficient people.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stimulation of the immune system by gut microbes might prevent allergy development. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the hypothesis that sensitization to food allergens and atopic eczema are influenced by the infantile intestinal colonization pattern. METHODS: Infants were recruited perinatally in Goteborg (n = 116), London (n = 108), and Rome (n = 100). Commensal bacteria were identified to the genus or species level in rectal (3 days) and quantitative stool cultures (7, 14, and 28 days and 2, 6, and 12 months of age). At 18 months of age, atopic eczema and total and food-specific IgE levels were assessed. These outcomes were modeled in relation to time to colonization with 11 bacterial groups and to ratios of strict anaerobic to facultative anaerobic bacteria and gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria at certain time points. Study center, mode of delivery, parity, and infant diet were included as covariates. RESULTS: Neither atopic eczema nor food-specific IgE by 18 months of age were associated with time of acquisition of any particular bacterial group. Cesarean section delayed colonization by Escherichia coli and Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium species, giving way to, for example, Clostridium species. Lack of older siblings was associated with earlier colonization by Clostridium species and lower strict anaerobic/facultative anaerobic ratio at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the hypothesis that sensitization to foods or atopic eczema in European infants in early life is associated with lack of any particular culturable intestinal commensal bacteria.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is considered the main viral cause of acute gastroenteritis in children in both developed and developing countries. The aim of the present study was to continue the surveillance of rotavirus in the Paraguayan population in anticipation of a rotavirus vaccination in children. MATERIAL/METHODS: Fecal samples from infants (< or =5 years of age) and adults with diarrhea (912 and 801 samples, respectively) were collected in Paraguay during 2004-2005. Rotavirus incidence was screened by PAGE and genotyping was performed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. RESULTS: Rotavirus incidence was 23.8% and 19.4% for children and adults, respectively. The rotavirus incidence was higher in the coolest and driest months of the year. Five different group A rotavirus electropherotypes were detected. Rotaviruses with a long electropherotype were the most frequently detected in children in 2004 and 2005. However, in 2005 (after six years of absence in Paraguay) rotaviruses with a short electropherotype were detected at high frequency in both children and adults. Of these, 14 samples were genotyped (11 from children and 3 from adults) and all of them showed the G2P[4] type.

			"abstract": "Almost immediately after a human being is born, so too is a new microbial ecosystem, one that resides in that person's gastrointestinal tract. Although it is a universal and integral part of human biology, the temporal progression of this process, the sources of the microbes that make up the ecosystem, how and why it varies from one infant to another, and how the composition of this ecosystem influences human physiology, development, and disease are still poorly understood. As a step toward systematically investigating these questions, we designed a microarray to detect and quantitate the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences of most currently recognized species and taxonomic groups of bacteria. We used this microarray, along with sequencing of cloned libraries of PCR-amplified SSU rDNA, to profile the microbial communities in an average of 26 stool samples each from 14 healthy, full-term human infants, including a pair of dizygotic twins, beginning with the first stool after birth and continuing at defined intervals throughout the first year of life. To investigate possible origins of the infant microbiota, we also profiled vaginal and milk samples from most of the mothers, and stool samples from all of the mothers, most of the fathers, and two siblings. The composition and temporal patterns of the microbial communities varied widely from baby to baby. Despite considerable temporal variation, the distinct features of each baby's microbial community were recognizable for intervals of weeks to months. The strikingly parallel temporal patterns of the twins suggested that incidental environmental exposures play a major role in determining the distinctive characteristics of the microbial community in each baby. By the end of the first year of life, the idiosyncratic microbial ecosystems in each baby, although still distinct, had converged toward a profile characteristic of the adult gastrointestinal tract.",

For comparative purposes, we first applied the Bayesian formulation of the immigration-death model to the dataset from Egypt. We further analysed data obtained from a cross-sectional parasitological survey that determined the infection prevalence of S. mansoni among 447 individuals in a village in Cote d'Ivoire. Three consecutive stool samples were collected from each participant and analysed by the Kato-Katz technique. In the Cote d'Ivoire study, the observed S. mansoni infection prevalence was 41.6% and varied with age. The immigration-death model was able to correctly predict 50% of the observed age group-specific point prevalences. The model presented here can be utilized to estimate S. mansoni community infection prevalences, which in turn helps in the strategic planning of schistosomiasis control.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A point prevalence survey of VRE fecal carriage was carried out among patients who stayed at a 600-bed teaching hospital for at least two days. Resistance to vancomycin was detected by the E-test method. Epidemiological data was recorded for all patients included in the study and was used for the risk factor analysis. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients hospitalized for at least two days were enrolled in this investigation. Thirty-nine patients (30.5%) were colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Twenty-three of the 39 strains were identified as Enterococcus faecium, 13 were identified as Enterococcus gallinarum and three strains as Enterococcus casseliflavus. The risk factors that were significantly associated with VRE colonization included length of hospital stay (13.2 days vs. 8.6 days), age (60.7 years vs. 47.7 years) and the presence of underlying malignancies (28.2% vs. 11.2%). An association was found between VRE colonization and the use of antimicrobials with anaerobic activity, such as metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of all term, cephalic, singleton births delivered by multiparous women between 1991 and 2001. Duration of the second stage of labor was stratified into hourly intervals: 0-1 hour, 1-2 hours, 2-3 hours, and 3 hours or longer. Perinatal outcomes were analyzed by using chi2 test and multivariable logistic regression models, by using P<.05 and 95% CI to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Compared with women who delivered between the 0- and 2-hour interval, women with a second stage more than 3 hours had higher risks of operative vaginal deliveries (odds ratio = 13.27; 95% CI [9.38-18.8]), cesarean deliveries (odds ratio = 6.00; [4.06-8.86]), and maternal morbidity including third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations, postpartum hemorrhage, and chorioamnionitis. Their neonates had higher risks of 5-minute Apgar score less than 7 (odds ratio = 3.63; 95% CI [1.77-7.43]), meconium stained amniotic fluid (odds ratio = 1.44; 95% CI [1.07-1.94]), admission to intensive care nursery (odds ratio = 2.08; 95% CI [1.15-3.77]), composite neonatal morbidity (odds ratio = 1.85; 95% CI [1.23-2.77]), and longer neonatal stay in the hospital (odds ratio = 1.67; 95% CI [1.11-2.51]).

			"abstract": "In the context of poliomyelitis eradication, a reinforced sentinel laboratory network for surveillance of enteroviruses (RSE) was implemented in France in January 2000, and the purpose of this report is to describe the results of the five first years of surveillance. From 2000 to 2004, the RSE laboratory network performed detailed surveillance of the circulating enteroviruses. No wild-type poliovirus was isolated from humans during the 5 years of surveillance, although two imported vaccine polioviruses were detected. During the same period, Sabin-like polioviruses were identified on five occasions in the sludge from sewage treatment plants, but no wild-type poliovirus was found. Over the 5 years of surveillance, information was collected from 192,598 clinical samples, including 39,276 cerebrospinal fluid specimens, of which 14.7% were positive for enteroviruses, 45,889 stool samples (4.3% positive for enteroviruses), 70,330 throat swabs (2.2% positive) and 14,243 sera (1.4% positive). The ten main nonpolio enteroviruses typed were as follows, in decreasing order of frequency: E-30, E-13, E-6, CV-B5, E-11, CV-B4, E-9, E-7, CV-B1, and CV-B2. During the year 2000, an outbreak of aseptic meningitis due to three main enteroviruses (echoviruses type 30, 13, and 6) was monitored. Continued surveillance of enteroviruses is important to alert physicians and public health officials to changes in disease trends. Although the geographical coverage of the RSE network as well as the percentage of enteroviruses identified must be improved, the large number of samples tested for enteroviruses shows the ability of virology laboratories to detect the circulation of enteroviruses and to report the possible identification of poliovirus (wild-type, vaccine-derived, or Sabin-like).",

Thirty newborns were exclusively breast-fed while the remaining 60 were randomly assigned to receive either a FF or a standard formula (SF). The fecal pH of the breast-fed group was lower than the SF group (p < 0.05), although it was similar to that of the FF group on the third postnatal day, persisting for the entire 4 mo of the study. The difference in TI was statistically significant over repeated measurements among the groups. The FF infants showed a TI similar to the breast-fed newborns.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Neonates are subject to numerous factors that affect normal intestinal colonization. This study was to quantify bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the faeces of breast-fed neonates using quantitative real-time PCR assay, and to investigate the effects of different delivery on the development of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli. METHODS: The faecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli of 40 healthy breast-fed neonates were studied prospectively. Twenty infants were vaginally delivered (VD), and 20 by caesarean delivery (CD) with prophylactically 4 g intravenous cefradine administered to their mothers three times. The faecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli of neonates were consecutively quantified by SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR assay in the first 7 days after birth. RESULTS: The mean levels of bifidobacteria increased from 5.1 to 9.3 in the VD group vs from less than 4.6 to 8.7 in the CD group. The bifidobacteria colonization levels in six samples in the CD group were lower than the limit of detection on day 2. The mean levels of bifidobacteria in the VD group were significantly higher than in the CD group (p<0.05). The mean levels of lactobacilli increased from 4.9 to 7.2 in the VD group vs from 4.9 to 6.9 in the CD group. There was no statistical difference between two groups during the first week (p>0.05). The development of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli showed significant interindividual differences in all infants studied. CONCLUSIONS: Primary intestinal bifidobacteria in neonates by caesarean may be disturbed more significantly than lactobacilli.",

However, no hemodynamic studies were performed to depict the effects of VIP in an in vivo model of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), thereby limiting a complete understanding of the overall hemodynamic effects of VIP in PAH. METHODS AND RESULTS: The pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic effects of intravenous infusion of 100 ng/kg per minute of VIP in control and pulmonary hypertensive piglets at 6 to 8 weeks of age were assessed. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was induced after the instillation of meconium solution in the subjects' trachea and was characterized by the establishment of a persistently elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, diminished cardiac output, and elevated pulmonary-to-systemic vascular resistance (PVR/SVR) ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous intravenous infusion of VIP markedly decreased PVR/SVR ratio in pulmonary hypertensive subjects; however, it lowered blood pressure without causing any significant changes in PVR/SVR ratio in control subjects. Collectively, these results suggest an overall pulmonary vasodilative effect of VIP in PAH.",

In this study, we investigated whether this beneficial effect originated from increased number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the intestinal microflora of these infants. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, VLBW infants (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500g) received enteral glutamine supplementation (0.3g/kg/day) or isonitrogenous placebo supplementation between d3 and d30 of life. Faecal microflora was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization <48h, at d7, d14 and d30 of life. RESULTS: In 43/52 (glutamine group) and 43/50 (control group) infants, > or = 2 samples were analyzed. Baseline characteristics were not different between groups. The prevalence of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, Escheria coIi, streptococci and clostridia was not different between groups (p>0.05). In both groups, colonization with bifidobacteria was delayed, whereas potentially pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli, appeared rapidly after birth. Antibiotic treatment decreased the prevalence of all faecal bacteria (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased infectious morbidity in VLBW infants that received glutamine supplementation was not associated with alterations in the prevalence of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, E. coIi, streptococci and clostridia. In general, colonization with health-promoting bacteria was delayed, whereas potentially pathogenic bacteria appeared rapidly after birth. Antibiotic treatment delayed the bacterial colonization.",

Thirty-four patients were referred to the Immunology Service to study the hypogammaglobulinaemia-associated clinical picture. Food allergy was documented in 10 patients by personal and familial history, presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and elevated total serum IgE levels. Coeliac disease and human immunodeficiency virus infection were also ruled out. Protein loss through stools was assessed by clearance of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT). Serum immunoglobulin levels were determined by nephelometry and functional antibodies were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cellular immune response was assessed by in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens and cell subsets were analysed by flow cytometry. In five patients of the 10 patients we suspected a protein loss through the mucosa. Four of these five patients showed an increased AAT and the other showed an extensive cutaneous lesion. Immunological studies revealed normal antibody function, in vitro lymphoproliferative responses and cell numbers in four of the 5 patients. One patient showed abnormally low numbers of CD4(+) T cells as well as a defective proliferative response to mitogens. After diagnosis of cow milk allergy, milk was replaced with infant milk formula containing hydrolysed proteins. Recovery of immunoglobulin values and clinical resolution were achieved. Hypogammaglobulinaemia during early childhood in some children may be secondary to cow milk allergy, and immunoglobulins and cells may leak through the inflamed mucosa. Resolution of symptoms as well as normalization of immunoglobulin values may be easily achieved by avoidance of the offending allergen.",

A study was carried out to investigate whether this was caused by a new norovirus variant. Epidemiological data including monthly positivity rates and the numbers of outbreaks per month from January to July 2006 were analyzed and compared to those from 2002 to 2005. In a comparison with the epidemiological data from 2001 to 2005, an atypical peak of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis outbreak was observed beginning in May 2006, concurring with a striking increase in norovirus activity. Most of the outbreaks (>60%) were located in homes for the elderly. Phylogenetic analysis for both RdRp and 5' capsid regions showed that this epidemic was caused by a new genogroup II/4 variant. This variant was genetically distinct from the predominant variants of 2002 and 2004 but was closely related to one of the 95/96-subset variants which caused an epidemic in Hong Kong in 2001, suggesting that the 95/96 subset may be starting to recirculate.",

			"article_name": "Conditions of bifidobacterial colonization in preterm infants: a prospective analysis.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premature birth results in a delayed and abnormal qualitative pattern of gut colonization. This abnormal pattern is thought to affect intestinal development and contribute to a higher risk of gastrointestinal infectious diseases such as neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In particular, bifidobacteria are thought to play a major role. We therefore studied bifidobacterial colonization in preterm infants during the first month of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fecal samples were prospectively analyzed in 52 infants born at a gestational age ranging from 30 to 35 weeks fed with a preterm formula alone and, in 18, with their mother's milk. Fecal samples were collected twice per week during the hospital stay. Bifidobacterial colonization was analyzed with culture and a molecular method. RESULTS: Bifidobacterial colonization occurred in 18 infants at a median age of 11 days, always greater than the corrected mean gestational age of 35.4 weeks (SD, 0.9) and greater than 34 weeks for 16 of 18. Colonization by bifidobacteria was affected by neither birthweight nor mode of delivery nor antibiotics given to the mother or infant. In contrast, birth gestational age had a significant impact on colonization by bifidobacteria (P < 0.05), which always occurred in children born at a birth gestational age greater than 32.9 weeks (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Birth gestational age seems to act as a major determinant of bifidobacterial colonization in the premature infant, suggesting the role of gut maturation, a finding that should probably be taken into account in manipulations of the gut flora aimed at reducing NEC.",

Prenatal ultrasonograms (US) of cloacal malformations sometimes show ascites, hydrocolpos, and hydronephrosis. We herein describe the characteristic prenatal US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the cloacal malformations associated with meconium peritonitis. METHODS: The pre- and postnatal records of 11 newborn patients with cloacal malformations, treated in our hospital from 1988 to 2004, were reviewed. All fetuses underwent prenatal US by experienced obstetricians, whereas in addition, fetal MRI was performed in 1 patient. RESULTS: The prenatal US and/or MRI findings showed fetal ascites, a multicystic pelvic mass, oligohydramnios, and bilateral hydronephrosis in 5 of 11 patients with cloacal malformations. In these 5 cases, postnatal examinations showed associated hydrocolpos, hydrometrocolpos, and bilateral hydronephrosis; furthermore, 4 of these 5 cases also showed meconium peritonitis at laparotomy.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The intestinal flora of breast-fed infants is generally dominated by bifidobacteria which have beneficial properties. Their presence is due to various compounds of breast milk including prebiotic substances. AIM: This prospective, double blind, study compared the growth, acceptability and the proportion of bifidobacteria and clostridia in the stool flora of bottle-fed infants randomized to receive a formula with a specific mixture of 0.4 g/100 ml prebiotic galacto- and long-chain fructooligosaccharides or the same formula without added prebiotics. METHODS: Within 0-14 days after birth at term, healthy bottle-fed infants were enrolled to receive either a prebiotic formula or a standard formula. At recruitment anthropometric measurements were done. These were repeated at the age of 6 and 12 weeks. Stool samples were taken at inclusion and at the age of 6 weeks. The number of bifidobacteria and clostridia was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. RESULTS: There was good tolerance of the prebiotic formula. Somatic growth was similar in the two groups. Stool frequency was significantly higher in the prebiotic group (P=0.031). Infants in the prebiotic group had also softer stools as compared to the control group (P=0.026). Baseline values of microorganisms at study entry were similar. The percentage of faecal clostridia at the completion of the study was significantly lower in the prebiotic group (P=0.042), while the proportion of faecal bifidobacteria was higher in the prebiotic group as compared to the control group. However this difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.262). The percentage of E. coli was lower in the prebiotic group but again this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.312). CONCLUSION: An infant formula containing prebiotic oligosaccharides is well tolerated, leads to normal somatic growth and suppresses the numbers of clostridia in the faeces with a trend for higher percentage of stool bifidobacteria and lower percentage of E. coli.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: After poliomyelitis has been eradicated, access to live polioviruses will be highly restricted and the use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) will probably be discontinued. Countries using OPV must decide whether to switch to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or stop polio vaccination. Because data on the immunogenicity of IPV in tropical developing countries are limited, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of IPV in Cuba. METHODS: The study population consisted of healthy infants born in Havana. A total of 166 infants were randomly assigned to two groups. Group A received a combination of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine, the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, and IPV (DPT-Hib-IPV) at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Group B, the control group, received a combination of the DPT vaccine and the Hib vaccine at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Another group (group C, 100 infants), which did not undergo randomization at the same time as groups A and B, received the DPT-Hib-IPV combination at 8 and 16 weeks of age. Serum samples were collected before vaccination and at least 4 weeks after the last dose. Stool samples were obtained before and 7 days after challenge with OPV. RESULTS: The seroconversion rates in group A were 94%, 83%, and 100% for types 1, 2, and 3 poliovirus, respectively. There were no seroconversions in group B. The seroconversion rates in group C were 90%, 89%, and 90% for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For groups A, B, and C, the virus isolation rates after challenge with OPV were 94%, 91%, and 97%, respectively, and the mean log10 viral titers of any serotype were 3.46, 3.89, and 3.37, respectively. There was one major adverse event, an episode of hypotonia. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with two or three doses of IPV resulted in a rate of seroconversion of at least 90%, except for seroconversion against type 2. The viral titer of OPV shed in the stool after OPV challenge was reduced in both groups receiving IPV. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00260312 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 59 VLBW infants. Seven patients (disease group) developed severe abdominal disease defined as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or a condition leading to laparotomy. The remainder (n = 52) were considered reference infants and had a mean (+/-SD) gestational age of 27.2 +/- 2.6 weeks and a birth weight of 939 +/- 273 g. F-calprotectin was analyzed in meconium and weekly during postnatal weeks 1 to 8. In disease cases, more frequent samples were analyzed around the time of abdominal disease diagnosis. RESULTS: In reference infants the median (range) f-calprotectin level in meconium was 332 (12-9386) microg/g and correlated negatively to Apgar score. F-calprotectin in postmeconium samples was 253 (9-1867) microg/g and correlated positively to delivery by cesarean section, postnatal age, and volume of enteral feeds, and negatively to treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids. In reference infants no postmeconium sample had f-calprotectin levels >2000 microg/g. In disease cases f-calprotectin was increased to >2000 microg/g in 3 cases of NEC and 1 case of covered perforation with microscopic bowel inflammation. In 1 case of NEC without microscopic bowel inflammation and 2 cases of focal intestinal perforation, f-calprotectin levels never exceeded 2000 microg/g. CONCLUSIONS: F-calprotectin concentrations in VLBW infants are similar to previously reported levels in healthy term and moderately preterm infants. An f-calprotectin level >2000 microg/g is a useful but not an early marker of NEC and other severe intestinal inflammatory conditions in VLBW infants.",

Here, we have analyzed antimicrobial activity and polypeptide composition of meconium versus neonatal feces to address the development of antimicrobial defense of the neonatal gut. Extracts of meconium exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, and group B streptococci (GBS) but not against the yeast Candida albicans. Extracts of neonatal feces were found to possess low activity against E. coli, GBS, and C. albicans. However, the anti-B. megaterium activity was higher in the fecal extracts than in meconium. All activities were reduced or abolished when salt was added to the antimicrobial assay. The AMP cathelicidin LL-37, alpha-defensin HNP-1-2, alpha-defensin HD 5, and lysozyme were identified in both meconium and fecal extracts. In addition, HNP-3 and a fragment of azurocidin were found in meconium, whereas the holoprotein azurocidin was detected in feces. In meconium, histones H2A and H4 were isolated and identified by their antimicrobial activity. Notably, LL-37 and lysozyme were found at significantly higher levels in feces than in meconium. Our findings reveal that meconium and feces contain AMP, acting in the defense of the neonatal gut, and may be implicated in the control of the initial colonization.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is recognized as a significant cause of pediatric gastroenteritis worldwide. Comprehensive data on the burden of rotavirus disease in Europe were lacking. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted during the 2004-2005 season in selected areas of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, to estimate the incidence of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in children <5 years of age who require medical care in primary care, emergency department, and hospital settings. RESULTS: A total of 2846 children with AGE were included in the study, and, of the 2712 children for whom ELISA results were available, 1102 (40.6%) were found to be rotavirus positive. The estimated annual incidence of RVGE was 2.07-4.97 cases/100 children <5 years of age, and it was highest among children 6-23 months of age, with 56.7%-74.2% of all RVGE cases occurring in children in this age group. Overall, RVGE was estimated to account for 27.8%-52.0% of AGE cases, and it was responsible for up to two-thirds of hospitalizations and emergency department consultations, as well as one-third of primary care consultations for AGE. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus infections account for a significant proportion of AGE cases in children <5 years of age in Europe, many of whom require frequent primary care consultations or care in emergency department and/or hospital settings. The results of the present study suggest that routine rotavirus vaccination for infants <6 months of age could significantly reduce the substantial burden of this potentially serious childhood disease.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) constitutes a significant burden of pediatric disease. Knowledge of currently cocirculating rotavirus genotypes is required to help guide immunization strategies. METHODS: During the 2004-2005 RVGE season, a prospective, multicenter, observational study of RVGE was conducted in children <5 years of age seeking health care in primary care, emergency department, and hospital settings in selected areas of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Rotavirus was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and genotypes were determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of stool samples for which ELISA results were positive. RESULTS: ELISA results were available for 2712 of the 2846 children with acute gastroenteritis who were recruited for the study; of these 2712 children, 1102 (40.6%) were rotavirus positive. RT-PCR results were available for 1031 children with ELISA-positive samples. G1-G4 and G9 were the most prevalent genotypes identified: G1 was identified in Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom; G9 in Italy, France, and Belgium; and G4 in Germany. Only the G4 and G9 genotypes were identified in all study areas. Rotavirus infections showed seasonal variation, with different patterns noted among the genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus genotypes G1-G4 and G9 are associated with the majority of RVGE infections in the areas studied, with geographic and seasonal variation in the distributions of rotavirus strains. Rotavirus vaccines should, therefore, provide protection against all major genotypes to decrease effectively the RVGE disease burden in Europe.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although the radiographic characteristics of acute appendicitis have been well documented, the value of plain abdominal radiography has not been completely studied. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to establish the association and relevance of the image of fecal loading in the cecum detected by plain abdominal X-ray of patients with acute appendicitis. METHODS: One hundred and seventy consecutive patients of both sexes were admitted at the hospital with acute pain in the right flank. The hypothesis of appendicitis was confirmed by operation and histological examination. These patients were distributed into two groups: Group 1 (n=100), patients who had plain abdominal X-rays done a few hours before surgical treatment, and Group 2 (n=70), patients who had plain abdominal X-rays done before the surgical procedure and also the following day. All X-rays were taken from an anteroposterior view of the abdomen. Demographic data such as age, gender, and skin color (white, brown and black) and morphologic stages of acute appendicitis were also assessed. RESULTS: Radiographic sign of fecal loading in the cecum was detected in 97 (97%) patients of Group 1 and in 68 (97.14%) patients of Group 2. This sign could not be detected any longer after surgery in 66 of the 68 positive cases. Sensitivity of this radiographic sign for acute appendicitis was 97.05%. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic image of fecal loading in the cecum of patients with abdominal pain is associated with acute appendicitis. The image usually becomes undetectable shortly after the appendix removal.",

			"abstract": "AIM: To develop real-time quantitative PCR methods, based on the use of probes labelled with a stable fluorescent lanthanide chelate, for the quantification of different human faecal bifidobacterial populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: The designed quantitative PCR assays were found to be specific for the corresponding Bifidobacterium species or groups (Bifidobacterium longum group, Bifidobacterium catenulatum group, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium dentium). The detection limits of the methodologies used ranged between 2 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(3) cells g(-1) of faeces. The applicability of the developed assays was tested by analysing 20 human faecal samples. Bif. longum group was found to be the qualitatively and quantitatively predominant bifidobacterial group. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR procedures developed here are specific, accurate, rapid and easy methods for the quantification of Bifidobacterium groups or species in human faecal samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The developed procedures will facilitate rapid and objective counting of large numbers of samples increasing our knowledge on the role of gut bifidobacterial microbiota in health and disease.

METHODS: A total of 249 children aged 0 days-3 years were tested for the presence of H. pylori antigen in feces using the HpSA immunoassay. For verification purposes, a selection of samples were analyzed with PCR targeting the 16 S rDNA Helicobacter gene. RESULTS: H. pylori antigen in stool was detected in 52% (36/69) of the neonates, in 15% (7/46) of infants aged 7 days-1 month, and in 5% (7/134) of children aged 1 month-3 years. In neonates, H. pylori antigen detection was significantly associated with mode of delivery: 59% (30/51) with uncomplicated vaginal births were HpSA positive compared to only 10% (1/10) of infants delivered by cesarean section (P=0.02). Positive PCR results were found in 35% (9/26) of HpSA positive samples. Sequencing of PCR products revealed 97-100% homology with gene sequences from both H. pylori and other Helicobacter species. CONCLUSIONS: The low H. pylori antigen detection rate in children >1 month of age is in accordance with previous prevalence studies from Western countries. The unexpected finding of a high H. pylori antigen detection rate in neonates suggests that transient colonization may occur in the neonatal period.",

These steps are the major bottlenecks in current microbial comparative analyses. We used direct comparisons of taxon density distributions in an absolute evolutionary coordinate space. The coordinate space was generated by using alignment-independent bilinear multivariate modeling. Statistical analyses for clone library comparisons were based on multivariate analysis of variance, partial least-squares regression, and permutations. Clone libraries from both adult and infant gastrointestinal tract microbial communities were used as biological models. We reanalyzed a library consisting of 11,831 clones covering complete colons from three healthy adults in addition to a smaller 390-clone library from infant feces. We show that it is possible to extract detailed information about microbial community structures using our alignment-independent method. Our density distribution analysis is also very efficient with respect to computer operation time, meeting the future requirements of large-scale screenings to understand the diversity and dynamics of microbial communities.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Healthy, formula-fed, term infants (n = 226) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study formula groups: control group (n = 76), PG4 group (control formula supplemented with 4 g/L of a prebiotic blend, n = 74), or PGL8 group (control formula supplemented with 8 g/L of a prebiotic blend, n = 76). Anthropometric measurements were taken at 14, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of age, and 24-hour dietary recall and 24-hour tolerance recall were recorded at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of age. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 formula groups for weight growth rate or length growth rate at any time point. Significant differences in stool consistency were detected among the 3 formula groups at 30, 60, and 90 days of age (P < 0.001, P = 0.025, P = 0.004, respectively), with the supplemented formula groups having looser stools than the control group. The PGL8 group had significantly higher stool frequency compared with the control and PG4 groups at 30 days of age (P = 0.021 and P = 0.017, respectively), but all of the groups were similar at 60, 90, and 120 days of age. A statistical difference was detected among the formula groups in 3 categories of adverse events: diarrhea (control vs PG4, 4% vs 18%, P = 0.008), eczema (PG4 vs control, 18% vs 7%, P = 0.046; PG4 vs PGL8, 18% vs 4%, P = 0.008), and irritability (control vs PGL8, 4% vs 16%, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Infants fed formula supplemented with a prebiotic mixture achieved normal growth and stool characteristics more similar to those of breast-fed infants in comparison with infants fed an unsupplemented formula.

Symptoms and signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are non-specific but most commonly associated with withdrawal from maternal opioids. A high index of suspicion is required when presented with an infant who could be manifesting symptoms of NAS. In the absence of a reliable history of maternal drug exposure, analysis of neonatal meconium or urine may be indicated. Approximately 90% of infants exposed to opioids will exhibit signs of NAS, although a smaller proportion will require pharmacological treatment. Although few studies have evaluated the advantages of different therapeutic agents and strategies, opioid withdrawal is best treated initially with opioid medication. Supportive care of the infant should include assessment of the adequacy of feeding, evaluation of social circumstances (particularly child protection issues) and surveillance for transmission of viral infection.",

Faecal samples were collected between 2000 and 2003 from 685 children with symptoms of gastroenteritis. The children comprised three groups; 223 in the structured surveillance cohort, 203 in a community cohort and 259 in a cohort of hospitalized children. All samples were tested for the presence of viral pathogens using molecular methods. Questionnaires were sent to the parents/carers of the children recruited to the structured surveillance cohort in order to collect data that would allow an estimation of the severity of illness by means of the Vesikari score, and of the cost associated with gastrointestinal disease in this age group. A viral aetiological agent was detected in 53.5% of samples tested. Rotavirus was the most common pathogen found in all three cohorts followed by norovirus and enteric adenoviruses. Multiple viruses were found in 8% of the samples, and commonly involved rotavirus and any other virus. G1P[8] was the most commonly detected rotavirus strain and there was no significant difference in the distribution of rotavirus genotypes among the three cohorts. Analysis of the questionnaires indicated that rotavirus infections were likely to be more severe than any other virus infection, and children from whom a viral pathogen was identified were more likely to require rehydration therapy.",

			"article_name": "Cocaine detection in maternal and neonatal hair: implications to fetal toxicology.",
			"abstract": "Cocaine use during pregnancy is difficult to ascertain, and maternal reports are likely to be inaccurate. Presently, the dose-response characteristics between maternal cocaine use and fetal exposure and adverse effects are unknown. Clinically, some babies are harmed, whereas others are not adversely affected. Taking advantage of the fact that cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE) accumulate and can be detected months after exposure in maternal and neonatal hair, an analytical test for cocaine and BE was developed by the authors. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of maternal and neonatal hair cocaine as biomarkers of fetal exposure. Of nearly 10,000 cases, all mother-child pairs in whom at least one had cocaine and/or BE detected in hair were identified. The relationship between maternal and neonatal levels was studied. When available, these data were also compared with meconium levels of cocaine. Median cocaine concentration was 10-fold higher in hair of the mothers compared with the neonates (3.56 ng/mg vs 0.31 ng/mg of hair). Infants' cocaine in hair was positively correlated with maternal cocaine and BE in hair (r2 = 0.41 and r2 = 0.22, respectively, P < 0.001 for both correlations). Infants' BE was also correlated with maternal cocaine and BE concentrations in hair (r2 = 0.50 and r2 = 0.27, P < 0.001 for both correlations). Thirty-nine (40%) babies had negative cocaine and BE results despite their mothers being positive. Mothers whose infants were cocaine-positive had a median hair cocaine concentration of 7.34 ng/mg, significantly higher than those whose infants were negative (1.25 ng/mg). Maternal cocaine levels below 0.24 ng/mg may serve as a relative threshold for detectable fetal exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy. Fetal hair grows in the last trimester. Hence, a positive neonatal hair indicates maternal use after pregnancy became known, a strong indicator of maternal addiction. Transplacental exposure to cocaine of babies of addicted mothers is highly variable. The dose-response relationship of both cocaine and BE between maternal and neonatal hair suggests that the placenta protects some fetuses but not others. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to placental defense against cocaine.",

This resulted in the identification of a previously unknown polyomavirus provisionally named KI polyomavirus. The virus is phylogenetically related to other primate polyomaviruses in the early region of the genome but has very little homology (<30% amino acid identity) to known polyomaviruses in the late region. The virus was found by PCR in 6 (1%) of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates and in 1 (0.5%) of 192 fecal samples but was not detected in sets of urine and blood samples. Since polyomaviruses have oncogenic potential and may produce severe disease in immunosuppressed individuals, continued searching for the virus in different medical contexts is important.

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to investigate the chronic mercury intoxication in pregnant women and newborns living in Istanbul, Turkey. METHODS: The research was carried out as a prospective with 143 pregnant women and their newborns. Venous blood from the mother, cord blood from the neonate, and meconium were collected for mercury analysis. Frequency of fish and vegetable-eating and the number of teeth filled were investigated. Analyses were made in cold vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS, microg/L). RESULTS: Mercury levels were 0.38+/-0.5 microg/L (0-2.34) in venous blood of pregnant women, 0.50+/-0.64 microg/L (0-2.36) in umbilical cord blood and 9.45+/-13.8 microg/g (0-66.5) in meconium. Maternal blood mercury level was lower than the known toxic limit for humans (EPA, 5 microg/L). Mercury levels of the maternal venous blood were significantly correlated with umbilical cord blood. The primary risk factors affecting mercury levels were eating fishmeals more than twice a week and having filled teeth more than five. The fact that the mother had a regular vegetable diet everyday reduced the mercury levels. Increased levels of mercury in the mother and umbilical cord blood could lead to retarded newborns' weight and height. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women living in Istanbul may be not under the risk of chronic mercury intoxication. Fish consumption more than twice per week and tooth-filling of mother more than five may increase mercury level. On the contrary, regular diet rich in vegetable decreases the mercury level.",

Our objective was to investigate the effects of the oral administration of Bifidobacterium breve M-16V (B breve) on fecal lactic acid and SCFAs in low birth weight (LBW) infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fecal lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids from 66 premature infants were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography at 0, 2, and 4 weeks after birth. The subjects included 22 extremely LBW (ELBW, <1000 g), 22 very LBW (VLBW, <1500 g), and 22 LBW (<2500 g) infants. The infants were divided into two groups: those with and those without B. breve supplementation. RESULTS: In the control groups, fecal acetic acid and total SCFA concentrations were significantly increased at 2 weeks in the VLBW and LBW infants (P < 0.05) and at 4 weeks in the ELBW, VLBW, and LBW infants (P < 0.01 for each) compared with those at week 0. Fecal lactic acid concentrations showed a similar pattern during follow-up, but the differences were not significant. Four weeks after B breve administration, the fecal butyric acid concentrations were significantly decreased in the ELBW and VLBW infants (P < 0.05 each), and the ratio of the acetic acid concentrations to the total SCFAs was significantly increased compared with those of the control groups in the ELBW (P < 0.05), VLBW (P < 0.05), and LBW infants (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of B breve reduces the production of butyric acid, which may be helpful in protecting LBW infants from digestive diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis.",

In anticipation of the national immunization program, this study was undertaken to characterize rotavirus strains circulating among children in Recife, one of the largest cities in the northeast region of Brazil. Group A rotaviruses were detected in 102 (35%) of 290 faecal specimens collected from children under 5 years of age who presented with acute diarrhoea during a 1-year period between May 2004 and April 2005. In addition to the globally common G1P[8] serotype that accounted for 49% of strains, emerging rotavirus serotypes G8P[6] and G9P[8] represented 2% and 29% of strains, respectively. Following cell culture adaptation, RNA-RNA hybridization demonstrated that two Brazilian G8P[6] rotavirus strains shared a high level of genomic RNA homology with Malawian G8P[6] strains, and a Brazilian G9P[8] strain was related most closely to a G9P[8] strain from India. The results suggest that certain rotavirus strains have a much wider global circulation than generally appreciated.

			"article_name": "Prenatal cocaine exposures and dose-related cocaine effects on infant tone and behavior.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: In experimental models, prenatal cocaine exposure has been found to perturb monoaminergic development. In humans, numerous studies have sought clinical correlates, but few have focused on dose-related effects, especially as regards neurologic function beyond the neonatal period. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether prenatal cocaine exposure has adverse effects on infant neurologic, developmental and behavioral outcomes and whether any effects are dose-dependent. DESIGN/METHODS: Infants (398) were enrolled at birth from an urban hospital. Drug exposure was ascertained with biomarkers in hair (n=395), urine (n=170) and meconium (n=109). Children were followed prospectively and 286 (72%) were evaluated blind to drug exposure at 6 months of age with the Bayley scales, Fagan Scale of Infant Intelligence and a standardized neurological examination. RESULTS: Certain neurological findings increased significantly by the amount of cocaine detected in maternal hair, e.g. abnormality of tone, as indicated by extensor posture was detected among 28% of cocaine-unexposed infants, 43% of infants exposed to lower and 48% exposed to higher cocaine levels in maternal hair (p<0.009). Persistent fisting increased in a similar dose-dependent manner. These associations persisted in adjusted analyses. Prenatal cocaine exposure was not associated with developmental scores (mental, motor or novelty preference) but was associated with lower orientation scores in adjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: At 6 months of age, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with abnormalities of tone and posture and with lower orientation scores. Perturbations in monoaminergic systems by cocaine exposure during fetal development may explain the observed neurological and behavioral symptoms. Whether such findings in infancy increase the risk of later neurobehavioral problems requires further study.",

Stools were collected over a 22-month period during both rainy and dry seasons. A range of microscopic methods were used to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. Species determination was by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of oocyst-extracted DNA using 18S rRNA and COWP gene loci. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were seen in 5.9% (50/848) of samples, of which 43 amplified by PCR-RFLP indicated the following species: C. hominis, C. parvum, C. hominis/C. parvum, C. meleagridis and C. andersoni. Seven samples could not be amplified by PCR. Wider species diversity was found in the rural setting, and may be a result of increased malnutrition and zoonotic exposure in this area. Improvements in water, sanitation, household hygiene and animal control are required to reduce the incidence of infection in this population.",

			"abstract": "Intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase (Alk-SMase) and neutral ceramidase may catalyze the hydrolysis of endogenous sphingomyelin (SM) and milk SM in human-milk fed infants. The enzymes generate sphingolipid metabolites that may influence gut maturation. Alk-SMase also inactivates platelet-activating factor (PAF) that is involved in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We examined whether the two enzymes are expressed in both preterm and term infants and analyzed Alk-SMase, neutral ceramidase, SM, and sphingolipid metabolites in meconium. Meconium was collected from 46 preterm (gestational ages 23-36 wk) and 38 term infants (gestational ages 37-42 wk) and analyzed for Alk-SMase using C-choline-labeled SM and for neutral ceramidase using C-octanoyl-sphingosine as substrates. Molecular species of SM, ceramide, and sphingosine were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. Meconium contained significant levels of Alk-SMase and ceramidase at all gestational ages. It also contained 16-24 carbon molecular species of SM, palmitoyl- and stearoyl-sphingosine, and sphingosine. There were positive correlations between levels of SM and ceramide and between ceramide and sphingosine levels. In conclusion, Alk-SMase and ceramidase are expressed in the gut of both preterm and term newborn infants and may generate bioactive sphingolipid messengers.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite preliminary evidence, the role of probiotics in allergy prevention is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early probiotic supplementation prevents allergic disease in high-risk infants. METHODS: Newborns of women with allergy (n = 231) received either Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAVRI-A1) or placebo daily for the first 6 months of life. Children were assessed for atopic dermatitis (AD) and other symptoms at 6 and 12 months and had allergen skin prick tests (SPT) at 12 months of age. RESULTS: A total of 178 infants completed the supplementation period. Those in the probiotic group showed significantly higher rates of Lactobacillus colonization (P = .039). At 6 months, AD rates were similar in the probiotic (n = 23/89; 25.8%) and placebo (n = 20/88; 22.7%) groups (P = .629). There was also no difference at 12 months, although the proportion of children with SPT+AD was significantly higher in the probiotic group (P = .045). At 12 months, the rate of sensitization was significantly higher in the probiotic group (P = .030). The presence of culturable Lactobacilli or Bifidobacterium in stools in the first month of life was not associated with the risk of subsequent sensitization or disease; however, the presence of Lactobacillus at 6 months of age was associated with increased risk of subsequent cow's milk sensitization (P = .012). CONCLUSION: Early probiotic supplementation with L acidophilus did not reduce the risk of AD in high-risk infants and was associated with increased allergen sensitization in infants receiving supplements. The long-term significance of the increased rate of sensitization needs to be investigated in further studies. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings challenge the role of probiotics in allergy prevention.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study determined the prevalence of Campylobacter spp., Helicobacter pylori and Arcobacter spp. in stool samples from Venda in relation to diarrhea, intestinal inflammation and HIV status using specific molecular methods. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from hospital patients (255) and primary school children (67). Genomic DNA was extracted from the stools and molecular methods including PCR, PCR followed by restriction analysis and multiplex PCR were used to test for the different organisms. The lactoferrin content of the stools was determined using commercial kits from TechLab (Blacksburg, VA, USA). RESULTS: The prevalence of the different organisms was 50.6% for H. pylori, 10.2% for C. jejuni, 6.2% for A. butzleri, 6.5% for C. coli, 3.1% for C. concisus, 2.8% for A. cryaerophilus and 1.9% for A. skirrowii. Of all the organisms, only C. jejuni was significantly associated with diarrhea (84.8%) (chi2=21.025, P<0.001) and elevated levels of lactoferrin (78.8%) (chi2=16.919, P<0.005) and was an important pathogen associated with diarrhea among HIV positive individuals (22.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Campylobacter infections are common causes of gastroenteritis in Venda. Non-C. jejuni/coli Campylobacters such as C. concisus as well as A. butzleri and H. pylori may be involved in gastrointestinal diseases in the region but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

			"article_name": "Human faecal microbiota develops the ability to degrade type 3 resistant starch during weaning.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colonisation of the human colon starts immediately after birth. Bacterial composition is substantially influenced by the type of feeding. During weaning, microbiota diversifies considerably to finally approach the composition of that of adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of colonic microbiota obtained from different age groups to ferment resistant starch (RS). METHODS: Faecal samples of breast-fed and formula-fed infants, infants at weaning, adults and elderly subjects were used as inocula. Fermentation experiments were performed by applying a standardised in vitro batch method. Fermentability was established by measuring both metabolite production and substrate degradation. An RS type 3 (RS-3) was used as substrate; its behaviour was compared with that of lactulose (positive control), whereas inoculum without substrate was used as negative control. RESULTS: Overall fermentation patterns clearly showed that the human microbiota of all age groups is able to degrade lactulose. In contrast, RS-3 was found resistant to the attack by microbiota of both breast-fed and formula-fed infants. Bacteria collected from infants at weaning were able to degrade RS-3 completely, but slower compared with adults. With increasing age, RS-3 fermentation was observed to be slightly retarded again. CONCLUSIONS: Human faecal microbiota of all age groups is able to ferment lactulose in vitro quickly and completely. The ability to degrade RS-3, however, is only established during weaning. Whether fermentation-related production of short-chain fatty acids from RS-3 and concurrent modifications of the microbiota can result in potential health benefits to the host at this stage of life needs to be elucidated.",

This longitudinal study was the first undertaken to understand the effect of the supplementation on the infant's faecal microbiota and particularly the bifidobacteria. Eleven infants were enrolled. Their faecal microbiota were analysed using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) with bacterial and bifidobacterial primers. In parallel, bifidobacterial counts were followed using competitive PCR. Three periods were distinguished: exclusive breastfeeding (Bf period), weaning (i.e. formula-milk addition, W period) and postweaning (i.e. breastfeeding cessation, Pw period). The bifidobacterial counts were not modified, reaching 10.5 (Log10 cells g(-1) wet weight). In the TTGE profiles, the main identified bands corresponded to Escherichia coli, Ruminococcus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp., more precisely Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis and Bifidobacterium breve. For both TTGE profiles, the analysis of the distance suggested a maturation of the faecal microbiota but no correlation could be established with the diet. Despite a high interindividual variability, composition of the faecal microbiota appeared more homogenous after weaning and this point may be correlated with the cessation of breastfeeding.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To characterize the time course and physiologic significance of decline in serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) by mode of diagnosis and genotype, and to examine IRT heritability. STUDY DESIGN: We studied longitudinal IRT measurements in 317 children with CF. We developed statistical models to describe IRT decline. Pancreatic disease severity (Mild or Severe) was assigned using CF genotype and was confirmed in 47 infants through fat malabsorption studies. RESULTS: Infants with severe disease exhibited IRT decline with non-detectable levels typically seen by 5 years of age. Infants with mild disease exhibited a decline in the first 2 years, asymptomatically approaching a level greater than published norms. IRT and fecal fat were inversely correlated. IRT values in infants with meconium ileus (MI) were significantly lower than newborn-screened infants at birth. The high proportion of shared variation in predicted IRT values among sibling pairs with severe disease suggests that IRT is heritable. CONCLUSIONS: IRT declines characteristically in infants with CF. Lower IRT values in newborns with MI suggest increased pancreatic injury. Furthermore, IRT is heritable among patients with severe disease suggesting genetic modifiers of early CF pancreatic injury. This study demonstrates heritability of a statistically modeled quantitative phenotype.",

Information was also collected on the reason for requesting the test, test specifications, and test results. RESULTS: For 12% of the GP patients with gastroenteritis, a stool sample was requested and tested for enteric pathogens. In most patients, the duration, followed by severity of complaints or a visit to a specific, high-risk country were reported as reasons to request laboratory diagnostics. Tests were requested most often in summer months and in February. Campylobacter (requested for 87% of the tests), Salmonella (84%), Shigella (78%) and Yersinia (56%) were most frequently included in the stool tests. Campylobacter was detected most often in patients. CONCLUSION: Test requests did not always comply with existing knowledge of the etiology of gastroenteritis in GP patients and were not always consistent with the Dutch GP guidelines.

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activation of the innate immune system by microbial stimulation is believed to be critical for normal immune maturation, and there has been speculation that these pathways are important for inhibiting allergic-immune responses. OBJECTIVE: To assess innate immune function following a 6-month supplementation with probiotic bacteria. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one allergic, pregnant women were recruited into a randomized, controlled trial. The infants received either a probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1; Probiomics) or placebo (maltodextrin alone) daily for the first 6 months of life. Mononuclear cell samples were available from 118 infants. Functional responses to toll-like receptor (TLR) were assessed using ligands for TLR2 (Pansorbin) and TLR4/CD14 [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] and measuring cytokine responses in the supernatants. Antigen-presenting cell function, as well as capacity for cytokine production (IL-12p70 and IL-10) was assessed. RESULTS: Infants in the probiotic group did not demonstrate differences in innate immune function compared with those in the control group. No differences were seen when cytokine responses were examined following stimulation with Pansorbin (TLR2) or LPS (TLR4). Similarly, no differences were seen in the antigen-presenting capacity of these infants. The mean fluorescence intensities of human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes, B cells and dendritic cells (DC) subsets were not affected, nor were the percentage of circulating DC subsets affected by a 6-month supplementation with L. acidophilus LAVRI-A1.

Children, who rarely receive fluoroquinolones, provide opportunities to assess the frequency of fecal excretion by fluoroquinolone-naive hosts of fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli. Fresh nondiarrheal stools from children were processed by screening them on agar containing ciprofloxacin to recover ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli. Resistant isolates were identified, and ciprofloxacin MICs were determined. Resistant Escherichia coli isolates were also analyzed for urovirulence-associated loci.

			"abstract": "AIM: The intestinal flora of breast-fed infants is generally dominated by bifidobacteria which have beneficial properties. Their presence is due to various components of breast milk, including prebiotic substances. This prospective double-blind study compared the numbers of bifidobacteria in the stool flora of bottle-fed preterm infants randomized to receive for 14 days either a formula with prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides at a concentration of 0.4 g/dL or the same formula with maltodextrin as a placebo. METHODS: Within 0-14 days after birth, 56 healthy bottle-fed infants were enrolled to receive either the prebiotic or placebo. Faecal samples were taken at inclusion day and at study day 7. The number of bifidobacteria in the stools, stool characteristics and somatic growth were recorded during the study. RESULTS: In the group fed fructo-oligosaccharides, both the numbers of bifidobacteria in the stools and the proportion of infants colonized with them were significantly higher as compared to the placebo group (p=0.032 and p=0.030 respectively). There was also a higher number of bacteroids in the fructo-oligosaccharide group as compared to the placebo (p=0.029). At the same time, reduction was noted in the numbers of Escherichia coli and enterococci. (p=0.029, and p=0.025, respectively). Supplementation had also significant influence on stool frequency per day (p=0.0080). CONCLUSION: An infant formula containing a small quantity of prebiotic oligosaccharides is well accepted and leads to rapid growth of bifidobacteria in the gut of bottle-fed preterm infants while decreasing the numbers of pathogenic microorganisms.",

The relatedness of all the Lactobacillus strains isolated to known species was also determined both genetically and phenotypically. This study revealed that the human intestine is initially colonized by only a few (1-2) different cultivable strains whereas in adults the pattern becomes more complex with a higher diversity of strains. The adult samples contained three genetically distinct Lactobacillus strains in some cases, while infant samples generally harboured only one dominant Lactobacillus strain. Moreover, the species in general appeared to differ with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei/paracasei found mainly in adults, whereas Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus salivarius were more commonly isolated in infant samples. The data reaffirm the differences in Lactobacillus populations both between individual subjects and between the infant and adult, with an overall change in the diversity and complexity from early stages of life to adulthood.",

			"abstract": "Norovirus (NoV) is recognized as one of the most common causative agent of diarrheal disease in young children worldwide. The current study was undertaken to determine the distribution of NoV genotypes in Japan. A total of 3,864 fecal specimens from children with acute gastroenteritis in five regions (Tokyo, Maizuru, Saga, Sapporo, and Osaka) of Japan from July 1995 to June 2001 were collected and then tested for the presence of NoV by RT-PCR. Three hundred sixty four were found to be positive for NoV, accounting for 11%. The highest prevalence of NoV infection was in November, December, and January as the early winter months in Japan. NoV was subjected to be further characterized to sequencing analysis. All NoVs belonged to two different genogroups I and II and these represented 3% and 97%, respectively. This finding indicated that NoV genogroup II was the dominant group causing acute gastroenteritis in Japan. Interestingly, NoV strains were classified into 16 distinct genotypes including genogroup II genotype 9 that was firstly identified in Japan. Of these, NoV genogroup II genotypes 3 and 4 dominated over other genotypes and became the leading strains in Japanese pediatric population. In conclusion, diarrhea due to NoV infection is still a health burden in Japan. This report also stresses the great genetic diversity as well as the importance of NoV causing the diarrhea in Japan.",

			"abstract": "Three hundred and twenty-six Escherichia coli isolates recovered from 326 human faecal specimens from sporadic cases of diarrhoea in Kashmir valley, India, were investigated for the presence of stx(1), stx(2), eaeA, hlyA and lt virulence genes. None of the samples was positive for stx genes or Shiga toxins by PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty-three E. coli isolates showed the presence of the eaeA gene, whereas three isolates harboured the lt gene. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) belonged to 10 different serogroups. Out of 23 EPEC isolates, the majority (78.26%) were atypical while five (21.73%) were typical. Only one of the typical EPEC harboured the EAF plasmid. Subtyping of the eaeA gene showed the presence of eaeA-alpha(1), eaeA-beta, eaeA-xi and eaeA-eta in one, two, four and two isolates, respectively. None of the E. coli isolates possessed eaeA-delta, eaeA-epsilon and eaeA-zeta. This study further upholds the opinion that Shiga toxin-producing E. coli do not pose a major threat to human health in India and eaeA-alpha(1), eaeA-beta, eaeA-xi and eaeA-eta could be common EPEC subtypes prevalent in humans with diarrhoea in India. The present study appears to be the first report of subtype analysis of the eaeA gene from India and also records the isolation of EPEC with the eaeA-xi gene from humans.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of a broad range of external influences to the gut microbiotic composition in early infancy. METHODS: Fecal samples from 1032 infants at 1 month of age, who were recruited from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study in the Netherlands, were subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for the enumeration of bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis group, lactobacilli, and total bacterial counts. Information on potential determinants of the gut microbiotic composition was collected with repeated questionnaires. The associations between these factors and the selected gut bacteria were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Infants born through cesarean section had lower numbers of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides, whereas they were more often colonized with C difficile, compared with vaginally born infants. Exclusively formula-fed infants were more often colonized with E coli, C difficile, Bacteroides, and lactobacilli, compared with breastfed infants. Hospitalization and prematurity were associated with higher prevalence and counts of C difficile. Antibiotic use by the infant was associated with decreased numbers of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. Infants with older siblings had slightly higher numbers of bifidobacteria, compared with infants without siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The most important determinants of the gut microbiotic composition in infants were the mode of delivery, type of infant feeding, gestational age, infant hospitalization, and antibiotic use by the infant. Term infants who were born vaginally at home and were breastfed exclusively seemed to have the most \"beneficial\" gut microbiota (highest numbers of bifidobacteria and lowest numbers of C difficile and E coli).",

METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study of all pregnancies that were complicated by meconium-stained amniotic fluid in 2004. Cases were identified from a perinatal pathology database that contained data on all pregnancies complicated by meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Data abstracted from the charts included gestational age at delivery, umbilical arterial pH, birth weight, and the presence or absence of labor. Cases were stratified according to gestational age at delivery. The distribution of meconium-stained amniotic fluid across gestation was computed. The mean umbilical arterial pH values (with 95% confidence intervals) across gestation were assessed by analysis of variance. RESULTS: The mean umbilical arterial pH in women with meconium-stained amniotic fluid did not differ across gestation. The overall incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid was 12.0% (766 of 6,403 deliveries). The rates of meconium-stained amniotic fluid increased from 1.2% at 32 weeks to 100% at 42 weeks. CONCLUSION: The rising incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid with gestational age is consistent with the hypothesis that fetal maturation is a major etiologic factor in meconium passage. Also, the lack of variation of mean umbilical arterial pH across gestation suggests that fetal acidemia is not increased when meconium passage occurs earlier in pregnancy rather than at later gestational ages.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether probiotics administered for 6 months postnatally affect gastrointestinal symptoms, crying and the compositional development of the gut microbiota through infancy. METHODS: The study comprised of 132 newborns whose mothers were randomized to receive placebo or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) before delivery. The treatments of mothers/infants continued for 6 months postnatally. A specific symptom chart was used to monitor gastrointestinal symptoms and infant's crying during the 7th and the 12th weeks of life. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to establish the Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus/Enterococcus, Bacteroides and Clostridium counts in fecal samples at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. RESULTS: Numbers of different types of stools, vomits and crying time were comparable between the groups during the 7th and the 12th weeks of life. Dominant microbiota consisted of bifidobacteria throughout the study. At 6 months, there were less clostridia in faeces in the placebo compared with the probiotic group (P = 0.026), whereas after long-term follow-up at 2 years, there were less lactobacilli/enterococci and clostridia in faeces in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (P = 0.011 and P = 0.032, respectively), reflecting the impact of clostridia as a marker of microbiota succession in healthy infants. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic administration in the first months of life was well tolerated and did not significantly interfere with long-term composition or quantity of gut microbiota.",

The condition results from the accumulation of sticky inspissated meconium. Both nonoperative and operative therapies may be effective in relieving obstruction. The treatment of choice for uncomplicated meconium ileus is the use of enteral N-acetylcysteine or Gastrografin enemata. Once such therapy fails, surgery is indicated. A number of operative procedures are in use, including Bishop-Koop enterostomy, T-tube irrigation, resection and primary anastomosis, and enterotomy with irrigation and primary closure. During the period 1991-2003, five newborns required surgical intervention for uncomplicated meconium ileus. None responded to conservative management. All were males, including one set of twins. All underwent laparotomy, enterotomy, appendectomy, irrigation and closure of enterotomy. None required a second surgical procedure. CF was confirmed in all, and in each case, both parents were found to be genetic carriers of a mutational form of CF. A single surgical intervention is preferable in these patients, in view of the high rate of pulmonary involvement in CF patients.

Investigation into the possible nosocomial spread of enterovirus identified 31 other infected infants. Only 1 of the 31 was truly positive; 30 were false-positive results. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. Investigational laboratory studies were conducted to identify problems in diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: Stool cultures were used to identify asymptomatic infections. Investigation identified several problems in the procedures in identification of enterovirus: (1) stool specimens were not properly filtered, (2) insufficient number of tissue culture cell types were used, (3) nonspecific toxicity due to stool and the presence of Clostridia difficile toxin was responsible for cytopathic effects in tissue culture, (4) the failure to block nonspecific fluorescent staining led to misidentification of enteroviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The use of stool cultures to identify asymptomatic enteroviral infections in infants in an NICU can be fraught with problems because of high frequency of C. difficile toxin and the nonspecific toxic effects of stool on tissue culture cells. These problems can be rectified when proper procedures are followed.",

AIMS: To investigate the effect of a prebiotic mixture of galacto- and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides on the incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) during the first six months of life in formula fed infants at high risk of atopy. METHODS: Prospective, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial; 259 infants at risk for atopy were enrolled. A total of 102 infants in the prebiotic group and 104 infants in the placebo group completed the study. If bottle feeding was started, the infant was randomly assigned to one of two hydrolysed protein formula groups (0.8 g/100 ml prebiotics or maltodextrine as placebo). All infants were examined for clinical evidence of atopic dermatitis. In a subgroup of 98 infants, faecal flora was analysed. RESULTS: Ten infants (9.8%; 95 CI 5.4-17.1%) in the intervention group and 24 infants (23.1%; 95 CI 16.0-32.1%) in the control group developed AD. The severity of the dermatitis was not affected by diet. Prebiotic supplements were associated with a significantly higher number of faecal bifidobacteria compared with controls but there was no significant difference in lactobacilli counts. CONCLUSION: Results show for the first time a beneficial effect of prebiotics on the development of atopic dermatitis in a high risk population of infants. Although the mechanism of this effect requires further investigation, it appears likely that oligosaccharides modulate postnatal immune development by altering bowel flora and have a potential role in primary allergy prevention during infancy.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Contact with amniotic fluid causes intestinal damage in gastroschisis, and intraamniotic meconium has been shown to be responsible. Meconium has been shown to contain a significant amount of IL-8, which may be the responsible cytokine for harmful effects of meconium. Neonatal urine contains high amount of urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) compared with adult human urine. Urinary trypsin inhibitor has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on IL-8. Therefore, far from being destructive, presence of fetal urine in the amniotic fluid might be beneficial because human urine contains UTI. An experimental study has been performed to investigate whether presence of intraamniotic human urine (consequently UTI) besides meconium is beneficial on intestines of chick embryo with gastroschisis. METHODS: Five-day-old fertilized chick eggs were used. Gastroschisis was created through amniotic cavity without opening the allantoic cavity. Sterile urine and meconium were obtained from newborn humans. Study was conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage, gastroschisis was created, and meconium suspensions at minimal harmful meconium concentration were prepared using natural and denatured human neonatal urine and instilled into the amniotic cavity. In the second stage of study, various concentrations of UTI plus meconium suspension at minimal harmful meconium concentration was instilled into the amniotic cavity. RESULTS: Serosal thickening, inflammation, and focal fibrin deposits were observed in intestines of the groups with meconium and meconium in denatured urine. Histopathologic features of intestines of the group with meconium in natural urine did not differ from the intestines of the control group. Histopathologic examination of intestines of groups with meconium and meconium plus 50 U/mL UTI showed serosal thickening, inflammation, focal fibrin, and collagen deposits. Histopathologic features of intestines of the groups with 1:400 intraamniotic meconium plus 100 and 200 U/mL UTI did not differ from the intestines of control group. CONCLUSION: Urinary trypsin inhibitor 100 U/mL prevented the intestinal damage via inhibiting IL-8, which is contained by 1:400 concentration of meconium. Therefore, besides the existence of threshold level of meconium, the existence of UTI, which is capable of inhibiting IL-8 contained by threshold level of meconium, may be a factor in the occurrence of intestinal damage in gastroschisis.",

We hypothesized that GosFos would: (1) reduce stool viscosity and (2) accelerate gastrointestinal transport. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled double-blind trial 20 preterm infants on full enteral nutrition (gestational age 27 (24-31) weeks, postnatal age 42 (11-84) days, and weight at study entry 1570 (1080-2300) g were randomly allocated to have their feedings supplemented with either GosFos (1 g/100 mL) or placebo for 14 days. Stool viscosity was measured by high-pressure capillary rheometry. Gastrointestinal transport time was assessed as the time from feeding carmine red to its appearance in the diaper. The hypotheses were tested as a priori ordered hypotheses. Data are shown as median (range). RESULTS: Birth weight, gestational age, postnatal age, and weight at study entry did not differ between groups. GosFos significantly reduced both stool viscosity, as measured by extrusion force (32 (2-67) versus 158 (24-314) N), and gastrointestinal transit time (12 (4-33) versus 26 (5-52) h). No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Formula supplementation with GosFos reduced stool viscosity and accelerated gastrointestinal transport. Further trials are required to investigate whether GosFos facilitates enteral feeding advancement and early enteral nutrition thereby eventually reducing the incidence of catheter-related nosocomial infections and improving long-term outcome.",

A prospective, controlled, randomized, open 21-d study was conducted in infants with birth weight <1300 g and gestational age < 31 wk to assess the efficacy of combining intravenous (IV) sucrose iron (Fe) with erythropoietin (EPO) for increasing Fe absorption, RBC Fe incorporation, and erythropoiesis. Three clinically stable groups were enrolled at 3-4 wk of age: Control, EPO [2100 U EPO/(kg.wk)]; and IV Fe+EPO [2 mg IV sucrose Fe/(kg.d) plus 2100 U EPO/(kg.wk)]. All subjects received 9 mg/(kg.d) of oral Fe polymaltose. Subjects were not allowed RBC transfusions. Indicators of iron status and erythropoiesis were assessed before and 18 d after treatment. On d 4, tracer doses of oral polymaltose (57)Fe and IV sucrose (58)Fe were administered, and stool and blood samples were collected for Fe absorption and incorporation determinations. Compared with the Control group, the EPO group demonstrated greater hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and reticulocyte count, but no difference in Fe incorporation. In contrast, the IV Fe+EPO group demonstrated greater total Fe incorporation, Hb concentration, plasma ferritin, and reticulocyte count compared with the Control and EPO groups. Absorption of (57)Fe and nonisotopic polymaltose Fe did not differ among the groups (range: 48-58%, and 41-47%, respectively). We conclude that IV sucrose Fe administered in combination with EPO to very-low-birth weight premature infants significantly increases RBC Fe incorporation and erythropoiesis more than EPO alone, but without increasing iron absorption.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surfactant dysfunction due to inhibition is involved in the pathophysiology of meconium aspiration syndrome. Dextran addition has been shown to reverse exogenous surfactant inactivation by meconium, but the precise mechanisms and the morphological correlate of this effect are yet unknown. Morphological surfactant analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and stereology allows the differentiation of active (large aggregates = LA) and inactive (small aggregates = SA) subtypes. METHODS: To determine the in vitro effects of meconium and dextran addition on the morphology of a modified porcine natural surfactant (Curosurf), Curosurf samples were either incubated alone or together with meconium or with meconium and dextran, fixed and processed for TEM. Volume fractions of surfactant subtypes [lamellar body-like forms (LBL), multilamellar vesicles (MV), unilamellar vesicles (UV)] were determined stereologically. RESULTS: All preparations contained LBL and MV (corresponding to LA) as well as UV (corresponding to SA). The volume fraction of UV increased with addition of meconium and decreased with further addition of dextran. Correspondingly, the UV/(LBL+MV) ratio (resembling the SA/LA ratio) increased when meconium was added and decreased when dextran was added to the surfactant-meconium mixture. CONCLUSION: Meconium causes alterations in the ultrastructural composition of Curosurf that can be visualized and analyzed by TEM and stereology. These alterations resemble an increase in the SA/LA ratio and are paralleled by an increase in minimum surface tension. Dextran prevents these effects and may therefore be a useful additive to exogenous surfactant preparations to preserve their structural and functional integrity, thereby improving their resistance to inactivation.",

			"abstract": "Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 (O157) is infectious to humans, particularly children, at very low doses and causes not only haemorrhagic colitis but also other serious symptoms. To investigate an association between intestinal bacterial flora and resistance to such infections, we screened faecal samples for the presence of enteric bacteria that are able to suppress the growth of O157. Samples from 303 individuals, 35 children (aged < or =6 years) and 268 adults (aged 20-59 years), were examined. Colonies with different appearances on sorbitol MacConkey agar medium were screened for the production of bacteriocins inhibitory for O157 in an overlay agar plate assay. O157-inhibiting strains were isolated from 52 individuals. The prevalence of these bacteria tended to rise with age, and was significantly higher among 40- to 59-year-old adults (23/101, 22.8%) than among children (3/35, 8.6%; P<0.05). To test the hypothesis that these bacteriocin-producing strains contribute to resistance against O157 in human adults, we examined faecal samples of 25 healthy O157 carriers. Inhibitory bacteria were more prevalent among the latter (9/25, 36.0%) than among age-matched subjects who did not carry O157 (49/268, 18.3%). It appears, therefore, that inhibitory bacteria in the human gut may play a role in inhibiting propagation of O157 and/or suppressing expression of virulence factors by this pathogen.",

			"abstract": "Samples of groundwater, river water, river sediment, paddy soil, rice seeds, hen eggs, fish, umbilical cord blood, and newborn meconium were collected from October 2002 to October 2003 near a large site in China used for the disassembly of obsolete transformers and other electronic or electrical waste. Six indicator PCB congeners, three non-ortho dioxin-like PCB congeners, and six organochlorine pesticides were determined in the samples by GC with electron capture detector. The results demonstrated that the local environment and edible foods had been seriously polluted by toxic PCBs and organochlorine pesticides. The actual daily intakes (ADIs) of these pollutants were estimated for local residents living in the area. The intake data showed that the contents of PCBs in these local residents were substantial, as the ADI estimates greatly exceed the reference doses set by the World Health Organization and the United States Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The presence of the indicator PCB congeners in the cord blood and the meconium samples, as well as significant correlations (r (2) > 0.80, p < 0.05) between these levels, suggests a potential biotransfer of these indicators from mothers to their newborns. This preliminary study showed that obsolete transformers and other electronic or electrical waste can be an important source for the emission of persistent organic pollutants into the local environment, such as through leakage, evaporation, runoff, and leaching. Contamination from this source appears to have reached the level considered to be a serious threat to environmental and human health around the disassembly site.",

			"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Little is known about changes in intestinal microbiota during the important period of complementary feeding (weaning). This descriptive study investigated changes of selected gut microbiota and markers of gut permeability and the immune system in breast fed infants during the complementary feeding period. METHODS: 22 healthy, exclusively breast fed infants (from birth to 4 months) with no antibiotic intake during the month prior to the study, were followed from 4 to 9 months of age. Faecal and saliva samples were collected at the start of the study (V0) and at monthly intervals (V1-V5) for measurement of selective gut microbiota (bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, vancomycin-insensitive lactobacilli, enterobacteria, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens) using semi-selective media. Immune markers (alpha-1-antitrypsin, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), secretory IgA and TNF-alpha were measured in saliva and secretory IgA and TNF-alpha in faecal samples. RESULTS: High stool bifidobacteria counts at the start of the study (7.99 1 1.95 log10 CFU/g faeces) remained stable throughout the 5 months of complementary feeding while counts of enterobacteria and enterococci increased with age (P < 0.05 and P = 0.02 respectively). Vancomycin-insensitive lactobacilli increased significantly during weaning for V0 to V3 (P < 0.01), and then decreased slightly (V4). Faecal Clostridium perfringens remained below the detection limit during the study and parameters measured in saliva did not change. Faecal ECP decreased significantly from 1.011.4 (V0) to 0.510.9 mg/mg protein (V5) P = 0.03. CONCLUSION: Age and/or diet modifications during complementary feeding had no impact on faecal bifidobacteria counts but increased those of enterobacteria and enterococci. Transient increases in faecal lactobacilli and vancomycin-insensitive lactobacilli counts were observed. The reduction in faecal ECP may indicate a decrease in gut permeability (reinforcement of gut mucosa integrity) during the weaning period with age [corrected]",

			"article_name": "Lactate: creatinine ratio in babies with thin meconium staining of amniotic fluid.",
			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: ACOG states meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) as one of the historical indicators of perinatal asphyxia. Thick meconium along with other indicators is used to identify babies with severe intrapartum asphyxia. Lactate creatinine ratio (L:C ratio) of 0.64 or higher in first passed urine of babies suffering severe intrapartum asphyxia has been shown to predict Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE). Literature review shows that meconium is passed in distress and thin meconium results from mixing and dilution over time, which may be hours to days. Thin meconium may thus be used as an indicator of antepartum asphyxia. We tested L:C ratios in a group of babies born through thin and thick meconium, and for comparison, in a group of babies without meconium at birth. METHODS: 86 consecutive newborns, 36 to 42 weeks of gestation, with meconium staining of liquor, were recruited for the study. 52 voided urine within 6 hours of birth; of these 27 had thick meconium and 25 had thin meconium at birth. 42 others, who did not have meconium or any other signs of asphyxia at birth provided controls. Lactate and creatinine levels in urine were tested by standard enzymatic methods in the three groups. RESULTS: Lactate values are highest in the thin MSAF group followed by the thick MSAF and controls. Creatinine was lowest in the thin MSAF, followed by thick MSAF and controls. Normal babies had an average L:C ratio of 0.13 (+/- 0.09). L:C ratio was more among thin MSAF babies (4.3 +/- 11.94) than thick MSAF babies (0.35 +/- 0.35). Median L:C ratio was also higher in the thin MSAF group. Variation in the values of these parameters is observed to be high in the thin MSAF group as compared to other groups. L:C ratio was above the cutoff of 0.64 of Huang et al in 40% of those with thin meconium. 2 of these developed signs of HIE with convulsions (HIE Sarnat and Sarnat Stage II) during hospital stay. One had L:C Ratio of 93 and the other of 58.6. A smaller proportion (20%) of those with thick meconium had levels above the cutoff and 2 developed HIE and convulsions with L:C ratio of 1.25 and 1.1 respectively. CONCLUSION: In evolving a cutoff of L:C ratios that would be highly sensitive and specific (0.64), Huang et al studied it in a series of babies with severe intrapartum asphyxia. Our study shows that the specificity may not be as good if babies born through thin meconium are also included. L:C ratios are much higher in babies with thin meconium. It may be that meconium alone is not a good indicator of asphyxia and the risk of HIE. However, if the presence of meconium implies asphyxia then perhaps a higher cut-off than 0.64 is needed. L:C ratios should be tested in a larger sample that includes babies with thin meconium, before L:C ratios can be applied universally.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to organochlorine compounds (OCs) has been a subject of interest in recent years, given their potential neurotoxicity. Meconium is easily available and accumulates neurotoxicants and/or metabolites from the 12th week of gestation. AIMS: To determine whether neurotoxicants, specifically OCs, could be detected in serially collected meconium, and to compare the results with those obtained in cord blood samples. METHODS: A sample of cord blood and three serial stool samples were analysed in 10 newborns. Pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) and its metabolite dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), and hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-HCH) were analysed by gas chromatography. RESULTS: From serial stool collection and analysis in newborns, there was an increase in the concentrations of HCB, p,p'-DDE, PCBs, and beta-HCH between the first and last stools of the newborn. Levels of DDT diminished as pregnancy progressed. Concentrations in cord blood were positively associated with concentrations in meconium for p,p'-DDE and beta-HCH. CONCLUSIONS: Meconium is a very useful instrument for the investigation of fetal exposure to neurotoxicants; serial collection and analysis of meconium should estimate the timing and degree of in utero exposure of the fetus to neurotoxicants. Analysis and interpretation of neurotoxicants in meconium results is a complex process. Measurement in meconium of a wide range of neurotoxic substances should facilitate early identification of harmful exposures, and enable rehabilitation and instigation of preventive measures.",

The level of faecal SIgA antibody is associated with increased neutralization and clearance of viruses. Formula-fed infants who lack the transfer of protective maternal SIgA from breast milk may benefit from strategies to support maturation of humoral immunity and endogenous production of SIgA. We aimed at studying the effects of standard, prebiotic and probiotic infant formulas on the faecal SIgA levels. At birth, infants of whom the mother had decided not to breastfeed were allocated to one of three formula groups in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Nineteen infants received standard infant formula; 19 received prebiotic formula containing a specific mixture of 0.6 g galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)/fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)/100 ml formula and 19 received probiotic formula containing 6.0 x 10(9) cfu Bifidobacterium animalis/100 ml formula. Faecal samples were taken on postnatal day 5, day 10, wk 4 and every 4 wk thereafter until wk 32. SIgA in faeces was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. During the intervention, infants fed on prebiotic formula showed a trend towards higher faecal SIgA levels compared with the standard formula-fed infants reaching statistical significance at the age of 16 wk. In contrast, infants fed on the probiotic formula showed a highly variable faecal SIgA concentration with no statistically significant differences compared with the standard formula group. Formula-fed infants may benefit from infant formulas containing a prebiotic mixture of GOS and FOS because of the observed clear tendency to increase faecal SIgA secretion. Adding viable B. animalis strain Bb-12 to infant formula did not reveal any sign for such a trend.",

Viruses were the pathogens most frequently found in stools of infants with diarrhea, including 111 cases of rotavirus (23.6% of the total diarrhea cases) and 30 cases of adenovirus (6.3%). The second group was diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (86 cases, 18.2%), followed by Salmonella sp (44 cases, 9.3%) and Shigella sp (24 cases, 5.1%). Using the PCR technique to differentiate the pathogenic categories of E. coli, it was possible to identify 29 cases (6.1%) of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). Of these, 10 (2.1%) were typical EPEC and 19 (4.0%) atypical EPEC. In addition, there were 26 cases (5.5%) of enteroaggregative E. coli, 21 cases (4.4%) of enterotoxigenic E. coli, 7 cases (1.4%) of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and 3 cases (0.6%) of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. When comparing the frequencies of diarrheogenic E. coli, EPEC was the only category for which significant differences were found between diarrhea and control groups. A low frequency of EIEC was found, thus EIEC cannot be considered to be a potential etiology agent of diarrhea. Simultaneous infections with two pathogens were found in 39 diarrhea cases but not in controls, suggesting associations among potential enteropathogens in the etiology of diarrhea. The frequent association of diarrheogenic E. coli strains was significantly higher than the probability of their random association, suggesting the presence of facilitating factor(s).",

Generally, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. In intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. However, the Lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. For accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rRNA intergenic spacer regions, were developed for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different Lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (SF) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (OSF). A breast-fed group (BF) was studied in parallel as a reference. During the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the BF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the OSF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). The Lactobacillus species distribution in the OSF group was comparable to breast-fed infants, with relatively high levels of L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, and L. casei. The SF-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more L. delbrueckii and less L. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and OSF-fed infants. An infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of BF infants.",

METHODS: A pilot study to screen the stool color in infants for the early diagnosis of BA was undertaken from March 2002 to December 2003. We had designed an \"infant stool color card\" with 7 numbers of different color pictures and attached it to the child health booklet. Parents were then asked to observe their infant's stool color by using this card. The medical staff would check the number that the parents chose according to their infant's stool color at 1 month of age during the health checkup and then send the card back to the stool color card registry center. RESULTS: The average return rate was approximately 65.2% (78,184 infants). A total of 29 infants were diagnosed as having BA, and 26 were screened out by stool color card before 60 days of age. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 89.7%, 99.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. Seventeen (58.6%) infants with BA received a Kasai operation within 60-day age period. The estimated incidence of BA in screened newborns was 3.7 of 10,000. CONCLUSIONS: The stool color card was a simple, efficient, and applicable mass screening method for early diagnosis and management of BA. The program can also help in estimating the incidence and creating a registry of these patients.",

			"article_name": "Rectal bleeding in infancy: clinical, allergological, and microbiological examination.",
			"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rectal bleeding is an alarming symptom and requires additional investigation. In infants it has been explained mainly by hypersensitivity. In addition to dietary antigens, intraluminal microbial agents challenge the immature gut mucosa. Although controlled in the mature gut, these antigens may induce inflammation in the developing gastrointestinal tract. The objectives of this study were to evaluate prospectively the clinical course of rectal bleeding and evaluate the impact of cow's milk allergy and aberrant gut microbiota on the condition. Because withdrawal of cow's milk antigens from the infants' diet is used as a first treatment without evidence of its efficacy, we also aimed to asses the effect of a cow's milk-elimination diet on the duration of rectal bleeding. METHODS: The study involved 40 consecutive infants (mean age: 2.7 months) with visible rectal bleeding during a 2-year period at the Tampere University Hospital Department of Pediatrics. Most of the infants (68%) were fully breastfed. At enrollment the infants were randomly allocated to receive a cow's milk-elimination diet (n = 19) or continue their previous diet (n = 21) for 1 month. Findings of colonoscopy, fecal bacterial culture, fluorescence in situ hybridization of selected gut genera, specific detection of fecal enteroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses, fecal electron microscopy for viruses, and mucosal electron microscopy for viruses were assessed. During each visit the severity of atopic eczema, if any, was assessed according to the SCORAD method. In evaluating the extent of sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE and skin-prick tests for cow's milk, egg, and wheat were studied. Cow's milk allergy was diagnosed by elimination and provocation testing. Five patients were hospitalized; all others were treated on an outpatient basis. The follow-up visits were scheduled 1 month later and at the age of 1 year. Sixty-four healthy reference infants were selected as controls according to the following criteria: age and timing of fecal sampling being identical to within 1 month. RESULTS: Altogether, 32 (80%) infants manifested bloody stools during follow-up (mean [range]: 2.1 [1-15] per day). The mean number of days with rectal bleeding on follow-up was 6. Typically, bloody stools occurred irregularly, for which reason the mean time to the last occurrence of rectal bleeding was 24 (range: 1-85) days from admission. Atopic eczema at presentation or during follow-up was diagnosed in 38% of the infants. Increased specific IgE concentrations or a positive skin-prick test were uncommon. The growth of the infants was normal on admission and during follow-up. Colonoscopy revealed typically focal mucosal erythema and aphthous ulcerations. The mucosa appeared normal in less than half of the patients. No anorectal fissures or colonic polyps were found. Light microscopy revealed that the overall architecture of the mucosa was well maintained. Acute inflammation or postinflammatory state and focal infiltration of eosinophils in the lamina propria were the most common abnormalities. A cow's milk-elimination diet did not affect the duration of rectal bleeding. Cow's milk allergy was diagnosed in 7 (18%) patients. Virus-particle aggregates were found in the microvillus layer of the colon epithelium in 8 cases. The surface epithelium of the virus-positive colon biopsy specimens regularly showed degenerative changes in the microvillus layer and epithelial cells. Electron microscopy study of the colon biopsies disclosed virus particles (30 nm in diameter) on the surface of epithelial cells. Virus particles or RNA were present in feces in only a minority of the patients. All fecal cultures were negative for Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia. Campylobacter jejuni was found in the feces of 1 patient, and fecal cultures were positive for Clostridium difficile in 4 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and yeast in 2 patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that at the time of admission the total numbers of bacteria and the numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in feces were lower in the patients compared with controls. The fecal concentrations of microbes characterized in this study (Bacteroides, bifidobacteria, Clostridium, lactobacilli, and enterococci) did not differ significantly between the time of admission and the second visit in the patients or controls. At the age of 1 year, 7 patients still suffered from cow's milk allergy, 5 of whom also suffered from multiple food allergies. Atopic eczema and histopathologically confirmed inflammation of the colonic mucosa at presentation were associated with persistence of cow's milk allergy at the age of 1 year. No patients exhibited gastrointestinal complaints or visible blood in stools. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal bleeding in infants is generally a benign and self-limiting disorder. Bloody stools occurred irregularly for only a few days during the following months. As in a previous report, most infants were exclusively breastfed. In the majority of the patients the cause of the condition remains unknown. An association with viruses can be seen in some patients. The microbes that commonly lead to bloody diarrhea in older children and adults, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, were absent in the present material. The low bifidobacterial numbers in fecal samples may indicate a significant aberrance that may provide a target for probiotic intervention to normalize gut microbiota. The gut microbiota overall seemed stable, because the numbers of major groups of microbiota tested did not change significantly between the time of admission and after 1 month. Cow's milk allergy among these patients is more uncommon than previously believed. Cow's milk challenge is thus essential in infants who become symptom-free during a cow's milk-free diet to reduce the number of false-positive cow's milk-allergy diagnoses.",

			"abstract": "Lung surfactants (LSs) form a monolayer at the lung's alveoli air-solution interface and play a crucial role in making normal breathing possible by reducing the surface tension. LS are affected by various agents that hamper their normal functioning. Tobacco smoke [Bringezu, F.; Pinkerton, K. E.; Zasadzinski, J. A. Langmuir 2003, 19, 2900-2907] and meconium, the first excrement of the newborn, are examples for such LS poison. In neonates, intrauterine aspiration of meconium is a known cause for morbidity and mortality. We studied in vitro the interactions between modified porcine LSs (Curosurf), used as LS replacement, and meconium, as well as between their artificial analogues, phospholipids mixture, and taurocholic acid (TA), respectively. The interactions were examined both in the bulk solution and at the air-water interface, representing the pre- and postnatal situations. It was found that the artificial analogues represent the natural system reliably and exhibit similar effects. TA, a principle component of bile, is an amphiphilic sterol compound in which the hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties are presented at different faces of the sterol plane. Here we found that TA affects the structure of both monolayers at the interface and surfactant aggregates in solution. A likely poisoning mechanism is by stereoselective penetration of TA into the lamellar or monolayer structures, thus disrupting the contiguous structure of the intact monolayer or the bilayer vesicle structure.",

			"abstract": "Human breast milk contains several proteins that supplement the newborn mucosal defense system and prevent gastrointestinal illnesses. One of these recently identified breast milk proteins is soluble CD14 (sCD14). By being an important component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor complex, it has been suggested that breast milk sCD14 could stimulate the newborn immune system and help reduce gastrointestinal Gram-negative infections. However, to deliver its potential immune benefits to the neonate, sCD14 would have to survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and retain its biologic activity. We analyzed the presence of breast milk sCD14 in the neonatal digestive system and found breast milk sCD14 to be absent from the stools of breast-fed infants. In vitro digestion analysis with simulated gastric and pancreatic fluids revealed that sCD14 is likely to survive the pepsin digestion but is more prone to been nicked and digested by pancreatin. These findings suggest that the presence of intact breast milk sCD14 in the upper digestive system could promote innate immunity in this low bacteria density lumen. The low concentration of sCD14 in the LPS-rich environment of the distal gastrointestinal tract (i.e. commensal microflora) could prevent excessive inflammation.",

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A set of 3,851 patients registered with the UK CF Database (diagnosed 1986-2003) were divided into four mutually exclusive categories by mode of presentation: meconium ileus or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (MI/DIOS); positive family history; newborn screening; and symptoms excluding MI/DIOS. The last symptom category was subdivided to create a group for respiratory symptoms alone. RESULTS: Females presenting with respiratory symptoms alone were diagnosed 9 months later than males (median age of diagnosis in males 22 months, n = 325; females, 31 months, n = 322; P = .028). No gender differences were observed for anthropometric, lung function, microbiological, supplemental feeding, or time since diagnosis using discriminant analysis applied to all patients (n = 461, Wilks' lambda = .97, P = .15) or to patients divided by genotype: DeltaF508/DeltaF508 (n = 168, Wilks' lambda = .97, P = .69), class I-III genotype (n = 251, Wilks' lambda = .96, P = .41), or class IV-V genotype (n = 73, Wilks' lambda = .90, P = .50) presenting with respiratory symptoms alone.

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This paper provides a preliminary picture of diarrhea with regards to etiology, clinical symptoms, and some related epidemiologic factors in children less than five years of age living in Hanoi, Vietnam. METHODS: The study population included 587 children with diarrhea and 249 age-matched healthy controls. The identification of pathogens was carried out by the conventional methods in combination with ELISA, immunoseparation, and PCR. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by MIC following the NCCLS recommendations. RESULTS: Of those with diarrhea, 40.9% were less than one year old and 71.0% were less than two years old. A potential pathogen was identified in 67.3% of children with diarrhea. They were group A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, with prevalences of 46.7%, 22.5%, 4.7%, and 7.3%, respectively. No Salmonella spp or Vibrio cholerae were isolated. Rotavirus and diarrheagenic E. coli were predominant in children less than two years of age, while Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis were mostly seen in the older children. Diarrheagenic E. coli and Shigella spp showed high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Children attending the hospitals had fever (43.6%), vomiting (53.8%), and dehydration (82.6%). Watery stool was predominant with a prevalence of 66.4%, followed by mucous stool (21.0%). The mean episodes of stools per day was seven, ranging from two to 23 episodes. Before attending hospitals, 162/587 (27.6%) children had been given antibiotics. Overall, more children got diarrhea in (i) poor families; (ii) families where piped water and a latrine were lacking; (iii) families where mothers washed their hands less often before feeding the children; (iv) families where mothers had a low level of education; (v) families where information on health and sanitation less often reached their households. CONCLUSIONS: Group A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis play an important role in causing diarrhea in children in Hanoi, Vietnam. Epidemiological factors such as lack of fresh water supply, unhygienic septic tank, low family income, lack of health information, and low educational level of parents could contribute to the morbidity of diarrhea in children.",

Deviations in this process precede the development of specific diseases providing the rationale for the use of probiotics to counteract them. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to characterize both the mother-infant bifidobacteria transfer at birth and the development of bifidobacteria microbiota during the first weeks of life in infants whose mothers received Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or placebo. METHODS: Species-specific PCR was used to assess the fecal bifidobacterial composition of mothers before and after delivery and in infants at 5 days and 3 weeks of age. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium longum was the species most commonly found in the mothers. Bifidobacterium catenulatum was the most prevalent group in infants at 5 days of age and B. longum the predominant species at 3 weeks. At 5 days of age, infants whose mothers received L. rhamnosus GG showed a significantly higher occurrence of B. breve and lower of B. adolescentis than those from the placebo group. In addition, L. rhamnosus GG consumption increased the bifidobacterial diversity in infants and reduced the Bifidobacterium microbiota similarity between mother and infant. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that specific changes in the transfer and initial establishment of bifidobacteria in neonates take place as consequence of the consumption of L. rhamnosus GG by the mothers.",

RESULTS: Twenty of 834 children (2.4%) were found to be infected. The odds ratio for H. pylori infection of the child was 12.9 (95% confidence interval = 3.2-52.5) if the mother was infected and 1.4 (0.4-4.6) if the father was infected, after adjustment for infection status of the other parent and for nationality.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-enriched formula on growth and faecal microflora during the first 6 months of life in normal healthy infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty healthy infants (up to 2 months) received LGG-supplemented formula or regular formula in a double-blind, randomized manner until the age of 6 months. Weight, length and head circumference were measured monthly and transformed into standard deviation scores (SDS). Faecal samples were obtained from a random sample of infants (n=25) at entry and at the end of the study. RESULTS: One hundred and five infants (51 in the LGG group) completed the study. Children receiving LGG-supplemented formula grew better: their changes in their length and weight SDS (DeltaSDS) at the end of the study were significantly higher than those receiving regular formula (0.44+/- 0.37 versus 0.07+/- 0.06, P< 0.01 and 0.44+/- 0.19 versus 0.07+/- 0.06, P< 0.005, respectively). The LGG group had a significant, higher defecation frequency 9.1+/-2.06 versus 8.0+/- 2.8 (P<0.05). More frequent colonization with lactobacilli was found in the LGG group, 91% versus 76% (P<0.05) at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS Infants fed with LGG-enriched formula grew better than those fed with regular formula. Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism of LGG in infant growth.",

Primers and probe were designed to target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/capsid genes junction. Performance of the newly developed assay was validated against a panel of 244 clinical stool specimens collected for patients with gastroenteritis. SV was detected in eight (3.3%) specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the positive isolates suggested that the assay could detect at least SV genogroups I, II and IV. In addition, the assay had an increased detection rate compared with a widely used conventional RT-PCR assay. Quantitative analysis showed that the assay could detect as low as 10 copies of viral cDNA per reaction. No cross-reactivity with norovirus and rotavirus was observed. In conclusion, the assay is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of SV from clinical stool specimens.",

Meconium, passed by neonates during their first post-natal bowel movements, is a matrix unique to the developing fetus and contains a long history of prenatal metabolism. Over the last two decades, the use of meconium as a matrix for assessing prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse has yielded methods exhibiting higher sensitivity, easier collection, and a larger window of detection than traditional matrices. Recently, a method has been developed for the analysis of fatty acid ethyl esters in meconium as a biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure, potentially facilitating the future diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in situations where gestational alcohol consumption history is unknown. Screening for prenatal exposure to illicit and abused licit drugs in meconium is possible by use of a variety of immunoassay methods with conformational analysis usually occurring by GCMS or LCMS. In spite of increased sample preparation time relative to blood and urine, the long metabolic history, coupled with the ease and wide window of collection of meconium make it the ideal matrix for determining fetal drug exposure.",

Of these, 98 (91.6%) were G9, 6 (5.6%) were G3 and 3 (2.8%) were G2, respectively. Identification of their P-types demonstrated that 103 (96.3%) were P[8], 3 (2.8%) were P[4], and 1 (0.9%) was P[3] genotypes. Determination of G- and P-type combination revealed that all of G9 isolates were associated with P[8]. G9P[8] was the most predominant genotype and accounted for the majority (91.6%) of rotaviruses detected in this study. Molecular characterization of these G9 isolates demonstrated that all had long electropherotype, 96 of 98 (98.0%) belonged to subgroup II, one belonged to subgroup I and the other one was subgroup unidentifiable. All of G9 isolates possessed NSP4 genetic group B except for one isolate that showed dual genetic group specificities, B and C. The full-length VP7 gene nucleotide sequences among 15 representatives of these G9 strains were found to be highly homologous with percent identities of 99.3%-100%. Comparison with other G9 strains recently isolated showed that their nucleotide sequences were closely related to those of the US strain, US1205 (98.7%-99.0%) and Thai strain, 97CM108 (98.1%-99.0%). Interestingly, they were most closely related to the Japanese strain, 00-SG2509VP7, isolated in the same epidemic season, with percent nucleotide sequence identity of 99.4%-99.8%.

For each district, we estimated the incidence of HUS among children <15 years for the period 1996-2001 from national HUS surveillance data and data obtained on cattle density. We used multivariate Poisson regression to quantify the relation, adjusted for covariates, between paediatric HUS incidence and exposure to cattle. In univariate analysis, a positive association was observed between several cattle-density indicators and HUS incidence. In multivariate analysis, HUS paediatric incidence was associated with dairy cattle density and the ratio of calves to children <15 years (P<0.001). Our findings are consistent with previous studies in other countries and support the recommendation to limit exposure of children to dairy cattle and manure to reduce the risk of STEC infection.",

Thirty minutes later, meconium-instilled animals intravenously received 0.5 mg/kg of dexamethasone (Dexa, n = 6), or were left without treatment (Meco, n = 5). The animals were ventilated for a further 5 hr and then sacrificed. The left lungs were lavaged with saline, and the white blood cell (WBC) count was estimated.

RESULTS: Significant interaction effects of PCE on language outcomes were found in multivariate longitudinal analyses using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Children with PCE had lower receptive language than unexposed children at 6 but not at 9.5 years, lower expressive language if they had lower birthweight, and lower expressive and total language if they were female. Other risk (e.g., violence exposure) and protective factors (e.g., preschool experience) were related to language outcomes regardless of PCE status.
